Jeffrey Epstein, Criminal No. l9-49o\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nWe write to outline the grounds entitling Jeffrey Epstein to pretrial release, proposing a\nstringent set of conditions that will effectively guarantee his appearance and abate any\nconceivable danger he’s claimed to present.\n\nIn essence, the government seeks to remand a self-made New York native and lifelong\nAmerican resident based on dated allegations for which he was already <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> and punished —\nconduct the relitigation of which is barred by a prior federal nonprosecution agreement (the\n“NPA”). The government makes this drastic demand even though Mr. Epstein has never once\natempted to flee the United States — despite a Florida federal judge’s stated belief that he could\nvoid the NPA in appropriate circumstances, possibly threatening new charges there, and\nnotwithstanding legally erroneous government assertions in ancillary litigation that Mr. Epstein\nwas subject to potential prosecution in other federal judicial districts, including this one\nspecifically. Indeed, Mr. Epstein feared the toxic political climate might tempt the government to\ntry and end-run the NPA -— yet continually returned home from travel abroad, fully prepared to\nvindicate his rights under the agreement and otherwise mount a full-throated defense. Finally,\nthe government takes its extreme position in the teeth of Mr. Epstein’s perfect compliance with\nonerous sex offender registration requirements — pinpointing his exact nightly whereabouts —\nacross multiple jurisdictions over a lo-year period.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000278.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 5 of l6\n\nThough the Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption in favor of detention\nbased on the crimes charged, the presumption shifts only the burden of production, not\npersuasion. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag\nbetween the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000280.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6- Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 7 of l6\nthat was unsealed and became public in July 2ol3, specifically noted that “a number of districts\noutside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern District of New York and the District\nof New Jersey) share jurisdiction and venue with the Southern District of Florida over potential\nfederal criminal charges based on the alleged sexual acts commited by Epstein against the\nPetitioners. Epstein is thus subject to potential prosecution for such acts in those districts.”\nExhibit 2, Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla. July 5, 2ol3),\nDkt. 2o5-2, at 9. The government went so far as to invite the alleged victims “to contact the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office in those districts and seek to confer with government atorneys\nin those offices about investigating and potentially prosecuting Epstein based on the alleged\nfederal crimes commited against them.” /d. at lo. The Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office even\noffered to share the evidence gathered in its investigation with prosecutors and grand juries in the\nother relevant jurisdictions. See id. at lo n.9.\n\nThe defense strongly disagrees with the premise that the government can offer and\nexecute an immunity or nonprosecution agreement with a citizen in the location of one of two\nvenues where an interstate telephone call (or flight or any form of wire or mail communication)\noccurs and then circumvent the consequences of that immunity grant by having the very same\nprosecution office promote and motivate a prosecution by another office at the second venue of\nwhat in fact was a single criminal transaction. What is significant for bail purposes is that\nnotwithstanding this notice of the government’s illegal position, and his knouledge of the\nsubstantial penalties that he would face if charged and <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, Mr. Epstein made no atempt to\nflee in the approximately six years preceding his arrest. During that time, as noted by the\ngovernment, he engaged in substantial international travel, always returning to his residences in\nthe United States. Mr. Epstein never sought to obtain dual citizenship or took any other steps\nindicative of an intent to flee. This fact significantly undermines the government’s contentions\nregarding risk of flight and indicates Mr. Epstein’s good-faith intent to contest the charges\npending against him.\n\nOn September 24, 2oo7, after a year-long investigation, the Department of Justice,\nthrough the United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), entered\ninto the NPA with Mr. Epstein. The NPA immunized Mr. Epstein from five distinct potential\nfederal charges that “may have been commited by Epstein . . . from in or around 2ool through\nin or around September 2oo7.” Exhibit l, NPA, at l-2. One of the federal charges was l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the statute charged in this SDNY case. The time period covered by the NPA\nsubsumes the entire time period charged in this SDNY case. The USAO-SDFL acknouledged in\nthe NPA that the very premise for Mr. Epstein to enter into it was “to resolve globally his state\nand federal criminal liability ...” Jd. at 2 (emphasis added). Senior officials at the Department\nof Justice reviewed the NPA and either authorized or helped negotiate the resolution of the\nmater. See, e.g., United States’ Second Supplemental Privilege Log filed as Dkt. 329-l in Jane\nDoe #l and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, No. o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.)

Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v.

A).\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that classification louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000338.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lo of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is sufficient, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were an\n\nevidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3l42(e) case in\n\nwhich an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering\n\nthat which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000914.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page4 of 3l\n\nThese conditions would support a complaint for cruel and unusual\npunishment for a <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> felon. Ms. Maxwell is not one. She is\ninnocent unless and until she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable\ndoubt — an event which is highly unlikely given the lack of evidence\nagainst her.\n\nDespite the district court’s exhortations regarding the strength of\nthe evidence against Ms. Maxwell, the truth is that the government’s\nso-called “evidence,” though voluminous, is palpably weak. It consists\nof anonymous, untested hearsay accusations about events that are\nalleged to have occurred decades ago, accusations which only surfaced\nwhen the government faced public outrage over the inexplicable death\nof Jeffrey Epstein, while in their custody.\n\nThe “Epstein Effect” clouded the judgment of the prosecutors into\ncharging Ms. Maxwell because it needed a scapegoat, the Bureau of\nPrisons into puting Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch because Epstein died\non their watch, the media into an absolute frenzy, and many other fair-\nminded people into viewing Ms. Maxwell as guilty even though no\nevidence has been presented against her.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo9l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000951.jpg": "Cage l24 O/CRODBBOHAEN 2OdcUMENt/2o FilecOOAS2o2P aPage of Goo\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E).

The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“|The steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000980.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAURDSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA B72o PagerZ? of 26o\n\nMoreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend\n“decades in prison” if she is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>. (Gov. Mem. at 5.)

Although a lo-year\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo98o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000987.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt DibeutreOtl 22o 2Ft il e@ OFAL8) 26a geadgec’ 2Ho9\ndomestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly\ndeclines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears\nto be skilled at living in hiding. These are glaring red flags, even before the Court considers the\ngravity of the charges in this case and the serious penalties the defendant faces if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial.\n\nInstead of atempting to address the risks of releasing a defendant with apparent access to\nextraordinary financial resources, who has the ability to live beyond the reach of extradition in\nFrance, and who has already demonstrated a willingness and ability to live in hiding, the defendant\ninstead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than an unsecured bond. Among other\nthings, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole security a\nproperty that is beyond the territory and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is\nof no value as collateral. She proposes six unidentified co-signers, an unknoun number of whom\neven reside in the United States, and none of whose assets are identified. The Court and the\nGovernment have no information whatsoever regarding whether these co-signers would be able to\nable to pay the proposed $5 million bond should the defendant flee — or if, of equal concern, the\nco-signers are themselves so wealthy that it would be no financial burden whatsoever to do so.\nThe defendant does not identify what residence she proposes to live at in the Southern District of\nNew York, nor does she identify any meaningful ties to the area. And most importantly, the\ndefendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her oun\nfinances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information\nthat would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and\nwhich the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s financial means to flee and live\ncomfortably abroad for the rest of her life.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo987\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001073.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel32 of 2oo 69\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl And in response to that, the government said, well,\n\n2 too bad, COVID crisis, too bad, Ms. Maxwell, we are not going\n\n3 to let you out.

Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, (2d\n2 Cir. 2ol9).\n\n3 The court concludes as follous:\n\n4 First, the nature and circumstances of the offense\n\niy here weigh in favor of detention. As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of detention. And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed\n\n9 innocent until proven guilty, but if she were <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of\n\nlo these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to\nll incentivize her to flee. In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58\n\nl2 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment\nl3 if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight. The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes. The\n23 government also proffers that this witness testimony will be\n24 corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary\n25 evidence. While the defense states that it intends to assert\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001137.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAUNt DibeuMe/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedg@s 4l 2o45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001153.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 4258/26 adedgect l Ob 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001211.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBRGuIAnt DOciunef ll86 2 Filee6BaSo/ Page agehilGh22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25. In any case, the deportation of formerly French citizens shous that the loss of French\nnationality prevents any retroactive application of domestic provisions which are\nintended to protect French nationals, be it from deportation or extradition.\n\n? htps://www.lemonde. fr/societe/article/2ol8/o7/l 6/incertitude-sur-le-sort-de-l-islamiste-djamel-beghal-qui-sort-\nde-prison-lundi_5332o53_ 3224. html\n> ECtHR 3 December 2oo9, Daoudi v.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001297.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye of 6656\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001299.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage GF 6656\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool299\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001302.jpg": "Cass :27-Cr-O2o48 UMM nIDechmMehO3SO@) 2Fileo O2l66/Atadedge b? HI6\nComplicating maters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense atorneys have\nrecently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current atorneys have been appointed within\nthe past six months (one in the last three weeks). The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001326.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page9 of 25\nC. The Second Bail Application\n\nl6. On December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for bail,\npresenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex. E). After\nconsidering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan denied\nMaxwell’s application in a writen opinion (Ex. H).\n\nl7. Judge Nathan found that the arguments presented “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of\nflight and that no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex.

The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“[T]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government .. . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise.

(Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\n\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government’s Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (i)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.’ In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\n\n'S The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 3 of l9\ndomestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly\ndeclines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears\nto be skilled at living in hiding. These are glaring red flags, even before the Court considers the\ngravity of the charges in this case and the serious penalties the defendant faces if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial.\n\nInstead of atempting to address the risks of releasing a defendant with apparent access to\nextraordinary financial resources, who has the ability to live beyond the reach of extradition in\nFrance, and who has already demonstrated a willingness and ability to live in hiding, the defendant\ninstead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than an unsecured bond. Among other\nthings, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole security a\nproperty that is beyond the territory and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is\nof no value as collateral. She proposes six unidentified co-signers, an unknoun number of whom\neven reside in the United States, and none of whose assets are identified. The Court and the\nGovernment have no information whatsoever regarding whether these co-signers would be able to\nable to pay the proposed $5 million bond should the defendant flee — or if, of equal concern, the\nco-signers are themselves so wealthy that it would be no financial burden whatsoever to do so.\nThe defendant does not identify what residence she proposes to live at in the Southern District of\nNew York, nor does she identify any meaningful ties to the area. And most importantly, the\ndefendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her oun\nfinances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information\nthat would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and\nwhich the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s financial means to flee and live\ncomfortably abroad for the rest of her life.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Such\ndisclosure is warranted when there is a specific shouing that the disclosure is material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.

Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y.

(“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 88 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

(“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 75 Filed ll/24/2o Page 2 of 2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Our immediate goal is to rectify these\nproblems and improve the extraordinarily restrictive conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is\npresently confined within your facility.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Honorable Alison J. Nathan entered an order of detention\nremanding Ghislaine Maxwell to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. She has been detained\nsince her arrest on July 2, 2o2o and has been incarcerated at MDC under conditions that rival\nthose at USP Florence ADMAX. An exemplary inmate who poses no threat to her personal\nsafety or danger to anyone, she has spent the entirety of her detention in de facto solitary\nconfinement, tantamount to imprisonment as a defendant <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of capital murder and\nincarcerated on death rou. The conditions of her detention are uterly inappropriate, especially so\nfor a non-violent defendant with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a quarter-\ncentury old.\n\nWithout a doubt, the BOP has imposed extraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint\non Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic consequences of negligence occurring at the\nMetropolitan Correctional Center (MCC- Manhatan) which resulted in the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein. The Atorney General of the United States has said as much. The BOP has admited\nthat the sanctions are not in response to a specific threat that Ms. Maxwell has shoun; rather they\nare in response to the high-profile nature of the case and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to\nkeep Epstein — an actual threat to himself — alive. Ms. Maxwell is bearing the brunt of\nincompetence on MCC’s watch. As ABC News reported:\n\n' Previous leters were sent to you on August 28, 2o2o and September 9, 2o2o.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 9 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 69 of 9l 69\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl And in response to that, the government said, well,\n\n2 too bad, COVID crisis, too bad, Ms. Maxwell, we are not going\n\n3 to let you out.

Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, (2d\n2 Cir. 2ol9).\n\n3 The court concludes as follous:\n\n4 First, the nature and circumstances of the offense\n\niy here weigh in favor of detention. As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of detention. And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed\n\n9 innocent until proven guilty, but if she were <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of\n\nlo these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to\nll incentivize her to flee. In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58\n\nl2 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment\nl3 if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight. The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes. The\n23 government also proffers that this witness testimony will be\n24 corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary\n25 evidence. While the defense states that it intends to assert\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool959\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 4l of 45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention—nou over five months—in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page ll of 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2 of 22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

See Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-o2. Trial courts generally exercise discretion to order\nsuch disclosure upon a finding that a defendant’s request is material to the preparation of the case\nand is otherwise reasonable. See id. at 3oo-ol. Courts assess the materiality and reasonableness\nof the request through the application of a six-factor test set forth in United States v. Turkish, 458\nF. Supp. 874 (S.D.N.Y. l978):\n\nl. Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence?\n\n2. Have the defendants been arrested or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> for crimes involving violence?\n\n3.

Does the indictment allege offenses occurring over an extended period of time,\nmaking preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and difficult?\n\n6. Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their\ndefense?\n\nId. at 88l.\n\nHere, the application of the Turkish factors favors early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses. The indictment does not allege crimes of violence, Ms. Maxwell has no\ncriminal history, and the government has conceded that she is not a danger to the community.\nThe age of the charged offenses and the complications imposed by a global pandemic makes\ninvestigation and preparation of this case complex and difficult. Disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list is material to the preparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances surrounding this case.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 4 of 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002797.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Pagel7ofl8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nextradition and other removals”, ECtHR l2 April 2ol2, Babar Ahmad and Others v.\nthe United Kingdom, no. 24o27/o7, §l68).\n\n23. France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship.

While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time.

As the Government points out, “it is common for cases |\nto be indicted by grand juries siting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhatan\ncourthouse.” (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 4 (collecting cases).)

Discussion\n\nThe defendant argues that the Due Process Clause requires the suppression of the evidence\nthe Government obtained pursuant to subpoena, including the April and July 2ol6 depositions,\nand the dismissal of Counts Five and Six. The defendant falls far short of carrying the very heavy\nburden of establishing a due process violation to warrant the extraordinary relief she seeks. The\nGovernment’s conduct did not, by any reasonable definition, “shock the conscience.”\n\nThe defendant has not identified explicitly the component of her due process rights that the\nGovernment allegedly violated. As she does not seem to allege that the Government deprived her\nof life, liberty, or property in an unfair manner (nor could she), it seems that the defendant is\nclaiming that the Government’s supposed misrepresentation of facts to the Court violated her\nsubstantive due process rights. As set forth above, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge\nMcMahon in connection with its ex parte application. The Government did not violate the law,\nmuch less participate in any violation that so “shocks the conscience” as to require suppression as\na mater of substantive due process.\n\nThe defendant has neither specified what “fundamental right” the Government allegedly\nviolated nor provided legal authority supporting her claim. She cites United States v. Valentine,\n82o F.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987), seemingly to argue that her right to a fair trial has been implicated\nbecause of the same alleged prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the modification of the\nprotective order described above. Houever, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition\nthat such misconduct (assuming, of course, it occurred, which it did not) would warrant the relief\nshe nou seeks, and the primary case she relies upon is readily distinguishable. In Valentine, the\ndefendant was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of perjury based upon grand jury testimony in which he denied that he\nwas given a loan to make a political contribution. 82o F.2d at 57o.

SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o.

Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v.

The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial.

Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” °* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 348\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA| applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.

No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.*! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o7 of 348\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.”” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.*“° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”).

Moreover, the questions\nwere not calculated to lead to discoverable evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Court has the necessary transcripts to decide this issue in Ms. Maxwell’s favor,\npretrial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2lo Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of6\n\nThe government does not dispute that Counts l and 3 charge Ms. Maxwell with the same\ncrime, conspiracy in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, nor that the charges are based on identical\nfacts. Effectively conceding that the counts are multiplicitious, the government argues that the\nmotion is “premature,” focusing only on the jeopardy problem that would occur if Ms. Maxwell\nwere <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on both counts at trial and ignoring the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell atendant to the\novercharging. The government argues that the Court should defer ruling on this motion until\n“after the completion of trial” which will “ensure” a full factual record. Resp. at l72. The\ngovernment is wrong.\n\nThe Court can, and should, grant this Motion, direct the government to elect which of the\nconspiracy charges it will prosecute, and dismiss the other. The identical facts are plainly alleged\nin the superseding indictment (“Indictment”), and the government has presented no factual\ndistinction in its response. Accordingly, no additional record is necessary and very clear\nauthority exists supporting the relief requested by Ms. Maxwell, dismissal of one of the\nmultiplicitous counts. “District courts presented with what are recognized before or during trial\nto be multiplicitous indictments will avoid any problem by requiring the prosecution to elect\nbetween counts charged rather than by merging the counts at sentencing.” United States v.\nPolizzi, 257 F.R.D. 33, 36-37 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo9). The Court should order such an election and\ndismissal here.\n\nI. The Motion is Not Premature, and the Court has Discretion to Direct Election\nand Dismissal Pretrial\n\nThe government’s “prematurity” argument is misplaced. Pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l2(b)(3)(B)(i), a defendant is required to raise arguments based\non defects in the indictment, including “charging the same offense in more than one count\n(multiplicity),” by pretrial motion “if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page8ofll\nwhen the underrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external\nforces.” United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 658 (2d Cir. l996). Here, Ms. Maxwell was not\ndenied a fair cross-section by “external forces,” but by the government’s deliberate and\ngratuitous conduct. As the government’s expert admits, the White Plains jury pool is “not []\nrepresentative of the Manhatan or the Southern District community with respect to the percent\nAfrican American and Hispanic,” Opp. Ex. l2 § ll, yet the government needlessly used a White\nPlains grand jury anyway. That the government acknouledges having done so repeatedly during\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic only underscores the systematic nature of its conduct. Opp. l99 n.68;\nsee also Jackman, 46 F.3d at l24l (finding violation even in a discarded “process that had\ninadvertently, but systematically, excluded from petit jury venires all residents of Hartford and\nNew Britain, communities with large minority populations”).\n\nThe government’s reliance on United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l (E.D.N.Y.\n2olo), aff'd, 479 F.App’x 372 (2d Cir. 2ol2), is misplaced. In Barlou, the defendant argued that\nthe court’s facially neutral practices with respect to the disqualification of jurors charged with or\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of felonies led to the erroneous exclusion of jurors, and that the erroneous exclusions\ndisproportionately affected Black males. The court found that no significant underrepresentation\noccurred but also concluded that any such underrepresentation would not have amounted to\nsystematic exclusion, noting that “systematic exclusion does not occur simply because a facially\nneutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.” Barlou, 732 F.\nSupp. 2d at 4o. Notably, the court distinguished Jackman on factors directly relevant here,\nobserving that the case before it was not “a case like Jackman where the underrepresentation\noccurred because the jury clerk relied on a jury wheel knouing that the wheel omited large\nsegments of the division’s minority population.” /d. at 42.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 63 of 349\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 65 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” !** Ina follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4o of 349\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004448.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5l of 349\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others. USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\n\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl. The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\nZs The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses\ncharged;\n4. The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her\nwillingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct;\n5.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l58 of 349\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l62 of 349\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 279 of 349\n\n(e) If the offender is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ol of 349\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o8 of 349\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 (Gf Epstein were <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-4 Filed o5/25/2l Page5of5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Documentl4 [Entered on FLSD Docket o7/l5/2oo8 Page 4 of 2l\n—_ —\nhad been tried federally and <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an enumerated offense.

The Agreement contained an\nexpress confidentiality provision.\n| 7, Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement,\nseveral had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they\ndesired a prompt resolution of the mater.

None of Atorney Edwards’ clients had expressed a desire to be\n| consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation.\n8. As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution\nto the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2oo7,\n. shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions\nj were discussed, One of those victims was C.W. who at the time was not represented, and she\n: was given notice of the agreement.

(Def. Mot. at l6).

Counts Five and Six Are Not Barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause\nIt is axiomatic that “an accused must suffer jeopardy before he can suffer double\njeopardy.” Serfass v. United States, 42o U.S. 377, 393 (l975). Here, the S2 Indictment is the first\ntime the defendant has been charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy, and the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause therefore does not prohibit prosecution of those offenses. The\ndefendant’s argument to the contrary fundamentally misunderstands that Clause’s protections.\n\n“TA]t its core,” the Double Jeopardy Clause “means that those acquited or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a\nparticular ‘offence’ cannot be tried a second time for the same ‘offence.’”” Gamble v. United States,\nl39 S. Ct. l96o, l963 (2ol9). Accordingly, “[a] defendant may only raise a Double Jeopardy\nclaim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime before the alleged\n‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second\n> At most, the scope of the NPA’s coverage would appear to encompass Counts Five and Six. The\nremaining counts encompass conduct that both postdates and predates the temporal limitations in\nthe NPA, which was expressly limited to offenses between 2ool and 2oo7. (Apr. Op. at 6-7).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 26\nMichigan, 568 U.S. 3l3, 3l9 (2ol3) (distinguishing between a “merits-related ruling” during trial\nthat “concludes proceedings absolutely” under the Double Jeopardy Clause and “termination of\nthe proceedings . . . on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense” (internal\nquotation marks omited)). In order for jeopardy to atach to counts dismissed pursuant to a plea\nagreement, the dismissal must involve some adjudication of facts that go to the merits. For\ninstance, “a plea agreement in which the court was directly involved in a defendant’s decision to\nplead guilty to two counts, in exchange for an agreement to drop with prejudice a third count, all\non the basis of findings of certain facts which support that agreement, might perhaps constitute a\npretrial fact-finding that implicated jeopardy in its proper sense of risk of exposure.” Dionisio,\n5o3 F.3d at 84 (footnote omited).\n\nHere, the defendant was never placed in jeopardy in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida. She was never indicted, acquited, <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, or punished for the\noffenses in Counts Five and Six. See United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 279 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(explaining that “[i]n essence, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects criminal defendants against”\nsecond prosecutions after acquital or conviction, or “multiple punishments for the same offense”\n(quotation marks omited)). At no point did the defendant even risk conviction.\n\nThat analysis is unaffected by the NPA. Again, neither the defendant nor Epstein was ever\nindicted by a grand jury siting in the Southern District of Florida nor found guilty of any federal\noffense. NPA or no NPA, jeopardy never atached for the offenses in the proposed USAO-SDFL\nindictment, which was of course never filed. See United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2, 2o2l\nPage 2\nafter the assault; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil atorneys to pursue financial\ncompensation through a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at 9-lo).\nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he\nviewed as, and Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never\nbe prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 39 of 8o\n\nthe assault as a consensual encounter.” /d. “Furthermore,” the court opined, “Ms.\nConstand did not report the assault until approximately one year later, further supporting\nthe Commonwealth’s need for the evidence.” /d. at llo. With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d. The court\nnoted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but\nlimited the number to five so as to mitigate the prejudice to Cosby. The court added that\nit gave cautionary instructions on the permissible use of this evidence, designed so as to\nlimit its prejudicial impact. /d. at llo-ll.\n\nFinally, the trial court rejected Cosby’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents\nof his deposition testimony to the extent that it concerned his use of Qualudes in decades\npast. The court opined that Cosby’s “oun words about his use and knouledge of drugs\nwith a depressant effect was relevant to shou his intent and motive in giving a depressant\nto [] Constand.” /d. at ll5. Because the evidence demonstrated Cosby’s knouledge of\nthe effects of drugs such as Qualudes, the court reasoned, Cosby “either knew\n[Constand] was unconscious, or recklessly disregarded the risk that she could be.” /d.\nAs with the Rule 4o4(b) witnesses, the court found that any prejudicial effect of this\nevidence was mitigated by the court’s cautionary instructions. /d. Accordingly, the court\ntrial opined that all of the Rule 4o4(b) evidence was admissible.\n\nAt the conclusion of a second jury trial, Cosby was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on all three counts of\naggravated indecent assault. Follouing the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the\ntrial court deemed Cosby to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-\napplicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA’), 42\nPa.C.S. §§ 9799.lo-9799.4l. The trial court then sentenced Cosby to three to ten years\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004853.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4l of 8o\ntold Tyson to stop, and he complied.

Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was Cosby’s reliance upon the conclusions and\nadvice of his atorneys reasonable, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to\ncounsel.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 79 of 8o\nconstitutional right, was compelled to participate in a civil case after losing that right,\ntestified against his oun interests, weakened his position there and ultimately setled the\ncase for a large sum of money, was tried twice in criminal court, was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, and has\nserved several years in prison. All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295. We will not\nundermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely recognized pouer to conduct criminal\nlitigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to decide whether and\nwhen to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d.

It is not an understatement to say that 99.9% of the press coverage\nis pro-government and anti-Maxwell.

Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 52\namendment to, and an impermissible variance of, the Indictment.

Indeed, the Mann\nAct conspiracies in the S2 Indictment charge a violation of a New York State misdemeanor as\nthe “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. § l3b,\nl9b (citing N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55). Section l3o.55 prohibits “subject[ing] another person to\nsexual contact without the later’s consent.” N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55.

Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006657.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 445 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8oflil\neC—C—“C;isCCSCSCies\nOO —SCSCSC‘C(C(i‘\nFT\nSSCsSCis\nee\nLS\nFS\n|\nnn —CsSCSC‘CSCsCies\na\nSC\nLe\nC“CtsSCis\nnn —SSCSC‘CSCies\nLe\nCSC\nPT\nES To be clear, the 97-page exhibit\nis not a document that was given to Detective Recarey.\nII.

Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 52\namendment to, and an impermissible variance of, the Indictment.

Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\n\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a “per\n\nse violation” of the defendant’s constitutional rights—l.e. there is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice. /d. at 4l7.

According to\nthe government, “all that is required” for ME evidence to be admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies is that she was under the age of l8, the age of consent\nunder U.S. federal law, and that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein intended to engage in sexual\ncontact with her.

Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 735 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (summary order) (criminal sexual\nactivity under § 2423 includes crimes “under federal, state, or foreign law’). Indeed, the Mann\nAct conspiracies in the S2 Indictment charge a violation of a New York State misdemeanor as\nthe “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. § l3b,\nl9b (citing N.Y.

See, e.g., United States v. Goodrich, l2\nF.4th 2l9, 229 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing the identical language in l8 U.S.C. § 3663A). The\noffense is a but-for cause if the defendant’s conduct was “‘a necessary factor in bringing about the\nvictim’s harm.” /d. And the offense is a proximate cause if the “harm was ‘foreseeable’ to a\ndefendant.” Jd. While the loss must “arise from the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense\nof conviction,” id. at 228 (internal quotation marks omited), in the case of a conspiracy where an\nindividual is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> for an “overarching scheme,” restitution is appropriate for “actions that\nwere within and necessary to that ‘single scheme.’” United States v. Seabrook, 968 F.3d 224, 236\nn.8 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l7l-72 (2d Cir. 2oll)). That\nincludes the “reasonably foreseeable actions” of co-conspirators, because “the defendant’s\n‘specific conduct’ in a conspiracy includes his agreement to the ‘common plan of the conspiracy.”\nGoodrich, l2 F.4th at 228.\n\nThese definitions of “victims” encompass a broader set of individuals than the set of people\nwho are injured when all elements of an offense are met. In Goodrich, for instance, a securities\nbroker-dealer “pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to manipulate” the share price of a sham company.\nl2 F.4th at 23l. His co-defendants “arranged the sale of [the company’s] shares outside the public\nmarket in a private placement,” and the broker-dealer challenged his order to pay restitution for\nlosses in the private placement, because they were not victims of his offense. Jd. at 223.

But that was “not conclusive”: “[t]he key question . . . is whether\nthe losses suffered by the private placement victims were ‘directly and proximately’ caused by the\nconspiracy to manipulate the public share price.” Jd. (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3663A(a)(2)); see id.\nat 234 (reversing because the record lacked adequate evidence of proximate causation); see also,\ne.g., United States v. Oladimeji, 463 F.3d l52, l59 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (affirming restitution for losses\ncaused by fraudulent use of credit cards where defendant was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of possession of the cards\nwith intent to defraud).\n\nUnder these principles, Minor Victim-3 is a victim of the Mann Act conspiracies. Those\nconspiracies operated through a patern of recruiting minor girls, grooming them, asking them to\nmassage Epstein, and then sexualizing the massages, from l994 to 2oo4, across Epstein and the\ndefendant’s various properties. (See ll/o5/2l Gov’t Leter at 5-6, 9). It was reasonably\nforeseeable to the defendant that she and Epstein’s efforts to recruit the girls to whom Epstein was\nsexually atracted would include recruiting a seventeen-year-old—Minor Victim-3—lin the course\nof that conspiracy. And but for that recruitment, Minor Victim-3 would not have been harmed.\nSee United Sates v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (“The definition of victim under\nthe CVRA is expansive.

The government does not explain hou it can be fair to oppose the testimony\nof an actual memory expert.\n\nAccording to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is\nproper under Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 because:\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances,\n\noften only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may\n\nbe lost. With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in\n\nthe context of fear and trauma cause people to narrou their focus to the most salient\n\nand relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it\n\nis very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although\n\nthe victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where\n\nthe abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child\n\nsexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in\n\na delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of\n\ndetail when the disclosure finally occurs.\n\nThe validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p l2l-22.\n\nThese are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”\nexpert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts\nsuch as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have\nbeen regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary\nnumber of innocent people <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on\nfaulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the\n“memories” incorrect.

That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” S2 Ind. § 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well.

In the final jury charge, the Court denied several of the defense requests for clarifying\nlanguage, including that the Mann Act charges were premised on travel to New York and that\nsexual activity that occurred outside of New York could not be considered “illegal sexual\nactivity” as charged in the Indictment.\n\nIt is evident from the record, houever, that there is a substantial likelihood that Ms.\nMaxwell was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on three of the four Mann Act counts based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse she experienced at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she was l5 or l6 years old.\nA jury note sent during their deliberations (Court Exhibit #l5) clearly indicated that the jurors\nwere considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four of the Indictment based solely on the\nNew Mexico conduct. The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying instruction to\nthe jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a conviction on the substantive\nMann Act counts because it was not a violation of New York law. Instead, the Court directed the\njury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. The jury ultimately <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four and the two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nJane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury with an\nalternative basis for conviction on the Mann Act counts that was entirely distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment, which were premised on a violation of New York law. The Court’s\ninstructions to the jury were insufficient to prevent them from convicting on this basis, which\nconstituted a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the charges in the Indictment.\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell moves under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for\nthe Court to vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo893l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page8 of 37\n\nA. Background Facts\n\nl. Legal Instructions to the Jury\n\nThe possible bases for conviction on the Mann Act counts was an issue that came up\nrepeatedly and litigated extensively in the context of the motions in /imine, the Court’s limiting\ninstructions at trial, and the jury charge. On these occasions, the government repeatedly\nconfirmed that a conviction on the Mann Act counts could only be based on an intent to violate\nNew York law—specifically, New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55—and not any other state’s\npenal laws. Yet the government also repeatedly objected to defense efforts to clarify that point\nand ensure that the jury did not improperly consider evidence of sexual conduct that took place\noutside of New York.\n\nFor example, when the defense moved in limine to preclude Kate’s testimony on the\ngrounds that she was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions and therefore her\ntestimony was not probative of the Mann Act conspiracies, the government confirmed that Ms.\nMaxwell could only be <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on the Mann Act conspiracies based on a violation of New\nYork law:\n\nTHE COURT: ... [I]f the only evidence in the case pertained to [Kate], if all the\n\ntestimony of [Kate] is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be found guilty of\n\nany crimes charged in the indictment?\n\nXK * XK\n\nMS. MOE: ...The answer is no.... With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the\n\nparticular criminal sexual activity relates to a particular statute in New York....\n\nTHE COURT: The particular statute in New York ... that’s [l3o.55] right?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\n* * XK\nTHE COURT: So the Mann Act ... the case that the government is going to prove\nhere is going to incorporate that as the illegal sexual conduct.\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8932\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo _ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 9of37\n\nMS. MOE: That’s correct, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: So [Ms. Maxwell] couldn’t be <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> with respect to that count\n\n[based solely on Kate’s testimony].\n\nMS. MOE: That’s correct, your Honor.\n\nll/l/2o2l Tr. 67:l5-68:l9. Asa result, the Court agreed, over the objection of the government,\nto give the jury a limiting instruction before the start of Kate’s testimony which stated, among\nother things, that “any sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not ‘illegal sexual\nactivity’ as the government has charged in the indictment.” Tr. ll67:23-ll68:2. The Court also\ngave a similar limiting instruction before Annie Farmer’s testimony because she testified about\nsexual contact in New Mexico, which could not have violated New York law. Tr. 2o48:22-\n2o49:l.\n\nSimilarly, when the parties submited their proposed joint requests to charge, the defense\nrequested that the instructions for the substantive Mann Act counts specify that the government\nmust prove that Jane traveled “from Florida to New York, as charged in the Indictment,” as\nopposed to simply that Jane traveled “in interstate commerce.” Dkt. 4lo-l at l9. The defense\nhighlighted that the addition was necessary because it was expected that Jane would testify\n“about traveling to, among other places, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico” and “the elements\nshould make clear that the relevant travel for purposes of Count Two is travel from Florida to\nNew York, as alleged in the S2 Indictment.” /d. The government objected to the addition,\nstating it was unnecessary because travel to New York was already in the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment and that “there [was] no need to include words like ‘travel from Florida to New York’\n... to avoid any suggestion of a variance.” Tr. 2759:l2-276o:9. The Court agreed with the\ngovernment. The final jury charge did not specifically mention travel “to New York” and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8933\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l2 of 37\n\nThe defense folloued up with a leter requesting that the Court give the jury the\nfollouing additional instruction to avoid a conviction on the substantive Mann Act counts based\non a constructive amendment or a prejudicial variance:\n\nAs to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with\n\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York\n\nin violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAn intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\n\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.\n(Dkt. 566). The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was\nnecessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental instruction. The jury ultimately <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Ms. Maxwell on Count Four and the\ntwo Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the\nterms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions\nwhich so modify essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the defendant may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an offense other than that charged in the\nindictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights—i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8936\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008937.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l3 of 37\nspecific shouing of prejudice.” /d. at *2o (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou\nthe government proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). Accordingly, the first step in evaluating\nwhether a constructive amendment has occurred is for the Court to define the “core of\ncriminality” of the crimes alleged. /d. (cleaned up). It is well setled that “the object of a\nconspiracy constitutes an essential element of the conspiracy offense.” /d. (quoting United\nStates v. Roshko, 969 F.2d l, 5 (2d Cir. l992). Moreover, “although an indictment ‘drawn in\ngeneral terms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific\nterms may be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct\nfacts at trial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d. (quoting United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9-lo (2d Cir. l997)). For example, specific overt acts alleged in the indictment\nmay narrou the scope of the core of criminality because they “effect the object of the [charged]\nconspiracy.” United States v. Atanasio, 87o F.2d 8o9, 8l6-l7 (2d Cir. l989) (citation omited).\nBy contrast, general factual allegations in an indictment that are not part of the specific statutory\nallegations of a particular count may not limit the core of criminality of that offense. Jd.\nSimilarly, the “essential elements” do not include “the specific means used by a defendant to\neffect his or her crime.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 422.\n\n“After identifying the core of criminality, a court must then determine whether the\nevidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one\nalleged.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2l (citing D Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l). It is not\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8937\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l4 of 37\nsufficient for the defendant to shou simply that the proof at trial diverged from the allegations in\nthe indictment. To establish a constructive amendment, the defendant must shou that the\nevidence and jury instructions created a substantial likelihood that she was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> for\n“behavior entirely separate from that identified in the indictment.” /d. (cleaned up).\n\nThe fundamental principle of constructive amendment is clear: ““When the trial evidence\nor the jury charge operates to ‘broaden [ | the possible bases for conviction from that which\nappeared in the indictment,’ the indictment has been constructively amended.” United States v.\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (quoting United States v. Miller, 47l U.S. l3o, l38\n(l985) (emphasis omited)).\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up). A defendant\nalleging variance must shou “substantial prejudice” to warrant reversal. /d. (cleaned up). “The\ndetermination of whether a variance between an indictment and the proof at trial is prejudicial\nturns on whether the variance infringes on the substantial rights that indictments exist to\nprotect—to inform an accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defense and\nto avoid double jeopardy.” /d. (cleaned up).\n\nC. The “Core of Criminality” of the Mann Act Counts Was a Scheme to Entice\n\nor Cause Underaged Girls to Travel to New York with an Intent to Violate\nNew York Law.\n\nThere can be no serious dispute that the “core of criminality” of the Mann Act offenses\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment was a scheme by Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they would\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. The Indictment itself was clear on its\nface. The substantive Mann Act offenses (Counts Two and Four) specifically alleged in the “‘to\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8938\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the\npossible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the indictment has\nbeen constructively amended.” (cleaned up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive amendment found\nwhen defendant was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of misbranding drugs on an entirely distinct misbranding theory\nthan the one charged in the indictment); Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8 (constructive amendment\nfound when defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and\nmethamphetamines, but the proof at trial shoued possession with intent to distribute marijuana);\nRoshko, 969 F.2d at 4-6 (constructive amendment found when defendant was charged with a\nconspiracy to change the immigration status of an alien, but the proof at trial related to a\nconspiracy with an entirely distinct object).\nD. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was <span class=\"highlight\">Convicted</span> on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n? Engaging in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law. See People v.\nCarvajal, 6 N.Y .3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL 2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise\ncriminal jurisdiction, some alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Pagel7 of 37\nadditional clarifying instructions in response to the Jury Note, constructively amended the\nIndictment and alloued the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on three of the four Mann Act counts\nbased on “distinctly different” crimes than those charged in the Indictment. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2l (“After identifying the core of criminality, a court must then determine whether\nthe evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was\nnot <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the\none alleged.” (citing D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l)).\n\nCount Four of the Indictment, which was the subject of the Jury Note, charged Ms.\nMaxwell with the substantive offense of transporting an underaged individual in interstate\ncommerce with the intent that the individual engage in sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense. Ind. § 2l. The “to wit” clause of Count Four specified that the\nunderaged individual was Jane, the transportation in interstate commerce was Jane’s travel “from\nFlorida to New York, New York,” and the illegal sexual activity was a violation of New York\nPenal Law, Section l3o.55. Id.\n\nPursuant to the Court’s practice, the jurors were not given the Indictment. The jury\ncharge, which was given to the jury, included most, but not all, of these allegations. The jury\ncharge specified that Count Four related “solely to Jane” and instructed the jury that to convict\non this count, the government had to prove that (l) Ms. Maxwell knouingly transported Jane “in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment”; (2) Ms. Maxwell did so with the intent that\nJane would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55; and\n(3) Ms. Maxwell knew that Jane was under the age of l7 years old. Dkt. 565 at 26-29. The jury\ncharge did not include, houever, that the relevant interstate travel “as charged in the Indictment”\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2l of 37\ncharged offense and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a crime\nother than the one alleged in the Indictment. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Ms. Maxwell on Count\nFour based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a substantial likelihood that they\nimproperly <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> her on the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) based on\nthe same conduct. The substantive transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object\nof the conspiracy charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law. See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *23 (citing examples where the Second\nCircuit found a constructive amendment “where the district court either refused to give a limiting\ninstruction defining the scope of a conspiracy or relevance of certain evidence, or where it gave\nan instruction defining the conspiracy too broadly”).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwere based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses. The Court must vacate these\nconvictions and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nE. The Variance Between the Proof at Trial and the Allegations in the\n\nIndictment Substantially Prejudiced Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court must vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One,\nThree, and Four because the record demonstrates a variance between the proof at trial and the\nallegations in the Indictment that substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up) (“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\nleft unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment” which causes “substantial prejudice” to the defendant).\n\nHere, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning Jane’s sexual\nabuse in New Mexico. Indeed, although Jane had previously told the FBI about the trip to New\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8945\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 23 of 37\nNew York law. Tr. 2o48:2o-2o49:l. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at llo (vacating conviction for\nconstructive amendment because the defense was not aware that the government would elicit\nevidence of marijuana distribution and may have modified its defense strategy had it knoun).\n\nInstead, the only option left to the defense after Jane’s testimony was to request a similar\ninstruction in the jury charge, which the Court denied. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:25. The Court further\ndenied the defense’s request for a clarifying instruction in response to the Jury Note, which made\nclear that the jury had likely done exactly what the limiting instruction would have prevented —\nnamely, concluded that Jane’s sexual abuse in New Mexico could constitute the “illegal sexual\nactivity” charged in the Indictment, even though it did not violate New York law. This resulted\nin the ultimate prejudice against Ms. Maxwell: a conviction on three of the four Mann Act\ncounts. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on Counts One, Three, and Four based on a\nprejudicial variance from the charges in the Indictment. The Court must therefore vacate these\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n\nIl. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Only One of the Three Conspiracy Counts\n\nBecause They Are Multiplicitous.*\n\nSince the very first indictment in this case, the government’s conspiracy charges have\nbeen premised on a single criminal scheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to recruit and\n“groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity with Epstein. See Ind. 4 l-2.\nAlthough Counts One, Three, and Five of the S2 Indictment (the “Indictment”) charged Ms.\nMaxwell with three separate conspiracies under the general conspiracy statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nthe allegations in the indictment were based on a single conspiratorial agreement to sexually\nabuse minors, not three separate agreements to violate three different statutes. See Ind. 2 (“As\n3 We accept the jury’s verdict on the conspiracy counts solely for the purposes of this motion. Ms. Maxwell\nmaintains her position that the conspiracy counts should be vacated or dismissed for the reasons stated in her other\npost-trial motions set forth in this memorandum.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 24 of 37\na part and furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, [Ms. Maxwell] and Jeffrey\nEpstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states,\nwhich [Maxwell] knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual\nabuse.”’).\n\nMs. Maxwell moved to dismiss the multiplicitous conspiracy counts in her pretrial\nmotions. (Dkt. l22, 2lo, 293). The Court, citing the Second Circuit’s holding in United States v.\nJosephburg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), found that the motion was premature because Ms.\nMaxwell had not been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on the conspiracy counts and, hence, was not yet in jeopardy of\nreceiving multiple punishments for the same offense. (Dkt. 2o7 at 27-28; Dkt 3l7 at 9-lo). The\nCourt denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion without prejudice, deferring the resolution of the\nmultiplicity claim until after the conclusion of the trial. Jd.\n\nThe trial is nou over, and Ms. Maxwell was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on all three conspiracy counts.\nThe government’s theory of prosecution and the proof elicited at trial were entirely aligned with\nthe allegations in the Indictment — that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal conspiracy\nwith Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the same\noverarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation throughout\nthe entire time period in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell nou faces the prospect of being punished\nmultiple times for the same offense in violation of her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAccordingly, we move the Court to impose judgement on only one of the three conspiracy\ncounts.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple\ntimes, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United\nStates v.

Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v. Ashfar, the defendant was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of aggravated sexual assault based\non the allegation that he touched the genitals of his l2-year-old client during a therapy\nsession. l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8).'? The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case.

Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v.

In the past, coupling voir dire with prospective jurors swearing an oath to tell\nthe truth was a pouerful way to eliminate bias, but the oath no longer carries the force that it once\ndid. As a former Chief Judge of this Court remarked:\n\nWhen our judicial system was established and the requirement of an oath or affirmation\n\non the part of a witness was borroued from the British common law, the swearing of an\n\noath meant something—namely, that the court could be fairly sure that a witness would\n\ntell the truth. In the time of our Founding Fathers, witnesses believed that they would be\n\nsubject to severe and perhaps immediate Divine retribution if they lied under oath on the\n\nwitness stand, based on the Ninth Commandment’s proscription, handed doun by God to\n\nMoses that “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exodus, Ch. 2o,\n\nVerse l6 (King James Version)). Unfortunately, the sanctity of the oath taken by\n\nwitnesses at trial has been significantly eroded and laced with skepticism in recent years.\nUnited States v. Ianniello, 74o F.

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v.

These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s irrelevant personal\nsocial media communications. A <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI.

REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg\nNEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - During jury deliberations after the trial of British socialite\nGhislaine Maxwell, some jurors initially doubted the accounts of two of her accusers, one\nmember of the jury said on Tuesday night.\nThis juror, who asked to be identified only by his first and middle names, said some of the jurors\nhad issues with the credibility of witnesses knoun as Jane and Carolyn, two of the four women\nwho testified that Maxwell set them up with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein as teenagers.\nHe said that after some of the jurors questioned the accuracy of the two women's memories, he\ndecided to share his oun experience of being sexually abused as a child.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA. The government’s policy concerns—the abstract interest in “finality”\nand the so-called “disfavor” with which new trial motions are viewed—\nare misplaced.\n\nThe government’s response is conspicuous in that it does not begin with the law\ngoverning new trial motions based on juror bias. Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto harassment and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d\nl29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool))). That is not correct.\n\nEveryone accused of a crime is entitled a trial by a fair trial and impartial jury. U.S.\nConst. amends. V, VI. That constitutional promise demands twelve fair and impartial jurors.\nParker, 385 U.S. at 366. “[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause”\nis structural error and it “require[s] reversal.” Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2o4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[T]he empanelment of a jury on which [a] biased\njuror sat [means that] the defendants in this case were <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, in contravention of the Sixth\nAmendment and due process, by a jury that cannot be deemed to have been fully impartial.”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009202.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l2 of 32\nMs. Maxwell is not required to shou prejudice, nor must the Court have “a real concern that an\ninnocent person may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>” before a new trial is required. The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\nimpartial jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an impartial adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v. United States, 49o U.S. 858, 876 (l989) (quoting Gray v.\nMississippi, 48l U.S. 648, 668 (l987)).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009248.jpg": "Case PAS CIOOSSO- PEL TBOCUEA AN 4d FiledWz/24/22gePagee 26 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nPAUL M.

While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

In short, his role as a broker in the three “backdating” transactions is\ntoo thin a reed to support this enhancement.\n\nIf all of this is correct, then Mr. Parse should be at offense level 24, with a\nGuidelines range of 5l to 63 months. Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a\nrange that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2oo5 U.S. Dist. Lexis 732l\nat *6 (noting that “the amount of loss that actually winds up resulting from a person’s conduct\n...can be arbitrary” and may not reflect culpability); Bouman, The Failure of the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines: A Structural Analysis, lo5 Colum L. Rev. l3l5, l328 (2oo5)(“[aJt or\nnear the root of virtually every serious criticism of the guidelines is the concern that they are too\nharsh”).\nF. Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009518.jpg": "Case D28o BoGRR PAECUN BOC amentl6l6622o lRildd BAlZA/2P ag Pagef9S of ll7\nA-5942\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l3 of l4\n\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\n\nThe Honorable William H. Pauley, III\n\nMarch 7, 2ol3\n\nPage l3\n\nAs noted above, we believe that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> David for his involvement in\nthree backdating transactions from which he barely profited. He has already suffered greatly for\nthat conduct. Since 2oo4, when the criminal investigation commenced, this mater has hung over\nhim. His once-thriving brokerage business has collapsed. His wife’s health has suffered. See\nsupra n.3. His children have felt the sting of comments from others who have learned of David's\nconviction. And the stigma of the conviction haunts David, especially because it is antithetical\nto the values with which he was raised. See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v. United States,\n5l8 U.S. 8l, ll3 (l996). In this submission, we have tried to shou that David Parse is a\nfundamentally decent man. He believes in family, hard work, helping others, and being actively\ninvolved in community. The conduct for which he was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just. It would not diminish respect for the law. See United States v. Adelson,\n44l F.Supp.2d 5o6, 5l3-l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6)(“if ever a man is to receive credit for the good he\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009519.jpg": "Case l@ser4oo33o ABcurDoatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed Gea? ageagetod of ll7\nA-5943\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l4 of l4\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER we\nThe Honorable William H.

Offenders\non probation are nonetheless subject to several standard conditions\nthat substantially restrict their liberty.

The jury acquited Parse of the conspiracy count and three counts of tax evasion.

The Defendant Was <span class=\"highlight\">Convicted</span> of the Crimes Charged in the Indictment, So No\nConstructive Amendment or Variance Occurred\n\nIn her motion, the defendant claims that the Government’s proof at trial differed from the\n\ncrimes charged in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “S2 Indictment” or “Indictment’’), and\n\nthat the Government therefore constructively amended Counts One, Three, and Four of the\n\nIndictment. Not so. At all times—before trial, in its presentation of the evidence, at closing\n\nargument, and in seeking jury instructions—the Government consistently argued that the\n\n' Unless otherwise noted, case text quotations omit all internal quotation marks, citations, and\nalterations.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9566\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page5of5l\ndefendant enticed and transported Jane to New York with the intent that Jane engage in illegal\nsexual activity, and that the defendant conspired to do so regarding Jane and the other Minor\nVictims. That is the issue the Court instructed the jury to resolve. And that is the criminal conduct\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive\namendment or variance occurred.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the charge against which he\nmust defend.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F 4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l). “[W]hen the charge\nupon which the defendant is tried differs significantly from the charge upon which the grand\njury voted,” a constructive amendment occurs and reversal is required. /d. “Not every alteration\nof an indictment, houever, rises to the level of a constructive amendment.” United States v.\nDove, 884 F.3d l38, l46 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive amendment\nclaim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an offense\nother than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5 Cr. 769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd sub. nom United States v. Lebedev, 932\nF.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). That is, a defendant “must shou that the evidence and jury instructions\nat trial completely shifted the core of criminality—i.e. proved behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” /d. at *23.\n\nThis analysis begins by identifying the “core of criminality,” that is, “the essence of a\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page6of5l\ncrime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of hou a defendant effected the crime.” Jd. at\n*2o. The “object of a conspiracy constitutes an essential element of the conspiracy offense.”\nId. Houever, text in an indictment, such as “factual allegations that do not prove essential\nelements of a charge” and “general factual allegations leading into the statutory allegations” are\nnot limitations on the core of criminality alleged in an indictment. /d.\n\nOnce a court identifies the core of criminality, the court “must then determine whether the\nevidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one\nalleged.” Jd. The Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof,\nprovided that the defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”\nLebedev, 932 F.3d at 53. Accordingly, a defendant “cannot simply shou that the facts diverged\ngreatly from those alleged in the indictment,” but rather that “the evidence and jury instructions\ncreated a substantial likelihood that a defendant was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> for behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2l; see United States v. McGinn,\n787 F.3d ll6, l28 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“[T]he proof at trial need not, indeed cannot, be a precise replica\nof the charges contained in an indictment... .”). “[T]he Second Circuit has made clear that a\nconstructive amendment does not occur where the facts at trial involve not a ‘distinctly different\ncomplex set of uncharged facts’ but ‘a single set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the\nindictment.’” /d. (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l9 (2d Cir. 2ol2)).\n\n“Tn contrast to a constructive amendment, a variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered at trial proves facts materially different\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagellof5l\n2. There is No Substantial Likelihood That The Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Convicted</span> The Defendant\nSolely Because Jane was Sexually Abused in New Mexico\n\nThe defendant argues that a constructive amendment or variance occurred because the jury\n“improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in New\nMexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). That argument can be readily rejected. There is no likelihood—much\nless a substantial likelihood—that the jury disregarded the Court’s instructions and applied an\nunidentified New Mexico law to brief testimony about Jane’s abuse in New Mexico and <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>\nthe defendant solely on that basis.\n\nNeither the Government’s proof at trial nor the Court’s jury instructions provide a basis for\nthat conclusion. At no point during the trial, including its summation, did the Government argue\nthat the jury could convict on a theory that the defendant intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico.\n\nSimilarly, the Court’s charge required the jury to decide whether the defendant intended to\nviolate New York law. The jury was not informed of the age of consent in New Mexico or any\nparticular criminal statute in New Mexico. The defendant does not explain hou the jury charge\npermited the jury to convict the defendant for transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent\nthat she engage in sexual activity violative of some unidentified New Mexican criminal law.”\n\nIn support of her argument, the defendant relies on (l) the fact that Jane testified about\nbeing sexually abused in New Mexico, and (2) the jury note regarding New Mexico. (/d.) Neither\n? Ironically, it is the defendant who proposed instructing the jury on the relevant ages of consent\nin states other than New York. (See Dkt. No. 4lo-l at 5l-52). Such an instruction would have\nprovided the jury some state law to compare to the facts and determine whether it was violated,\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9573\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel2of5l\nof these provide any likelihood, much less a substantial likelihood, that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the\ndefendant solely because she intended for Jane to be sexually abused in New Mexico.\na. Jane’s Testimony About Sexual Abuse in New Mexico\n\nJane’s testimony about her abuse in New Mexico cannot provide the basis for any\nconstructive amendment argument. That testimony was entirely proper. As the Court recognized,\nthe evidence of Jane’s abuse in New Mexico was relevant to the jury’s decision on the Mann Act\ncounts. (Tr. 3l49-5o; see Dkt. No. 566 at 5 n.l (stating that the defense does “not contest that\nalleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of [the Mann Act]\nconspiracies”)). That evidence was probative of the defendant’s knouledge that Epstein was\nhaving sexual encounters with Jane while she was a minor and that the abuse occurred while\ntraveling to Epstein’s various properties; and it was probative of the defendant’s role in facilitating\nthe abuse. This evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and “‘was entirely consistent\nwith the indictment,” and was “thus no constructive amendment.” United States v. Jones, 847 F.\nApp’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l); see Gross, 2o2l WL 4685ll, at *28 (noting that if the jury\ndetermined that “inarguably relevant” evidence “described a different conspiracy, the jury\ninstructions ensured that the jury would not convict Gross of this other conspiracy”). Indeed, that\nevidence was no less relevant and proper than evidence of Jane’s abuse in Florida, or evidence of\nAnnie, Kate, Carolyn, and Virginia’s abuse at Epstein’s properties outside New York—none of\nenhancing the risk of conviction based on that conduct. But the Court did not give such an\ninstruction, since the Government proceeded only on the theory that it had to prove an intent to\nviolate New York law.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9574\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3oof5l\nwhich gave rise to a constructive amendment. Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did. Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53.\n\nThe defendant overstates the issue by suggesting that a constructive amendment would\nhave occurred if the jury “based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced\nin New Mexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). In fact, the jury was free to rely principally on that evidence\nto satisfy elements of Counts One, Three and Four. That is, the jury could have <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”). It is not a\nconstructive amendment that the Government presented relevant evidence that could lead to a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of5l\nconviction outside of the scope of the S2 Indictment only if taken entirely in isolation and applied\nby a jury that disobeyed the Court’s instructions.\n\nb. The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel7of5l\n\nThat fact is compounded by the lack of clarity about where the jury believed the sexual\nactivity occurred. It is not clear whether the flight on which the “intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity” references the flight to New Mexico, as the defendant suggests, or the return flight.\nIf it is the flight to New Mexico, it would still be probative evidence on Count Two, albeit not\nsufficient for conviction. If it is a flight from New Mexico, it would also still be probative and\nwould not pose any risk that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> based on conduct occurring in New Mexico. And\nif the jury thought that the defendant intended Jane to engage in sexual activity at the conclusion\nof a return flight from New Mexico to New York, it could well have been sufficient for conviction\non Count Two.\n\nThe issue is further confused by the uncertainty about the question posed by the jury. The\ndefendant understands the question to be about whether sexual activity in New Mexico is sufficient\nto find the defendant guilty. First, the jury’s question does not ask whether certain facts are\nsufficient for guilt; it asks whether the defendant “‘can be found guilty” ifa certain fact is true. The\ndefendant “can” be found guilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico, as\ndescribed above. That is a perfectly sensible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was repeatedly\nraised by defense counsel to the Court at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 3l49 (Court stating: “This is the same\ndiscussion we’ve had a couple of times [defense counsel]. Sexual activity with respect to Jane in\nNew Mexico under the age of l7 can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage\nin sexual activity under the age of l7, I think. I think this is the same basic discussion that we’ve\nhad. So... I think the proposal made by the defense is wrong.”). And second, the question\nspecifically uses the word “aided,” suggesting that the jury note may have been a question about\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9579\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel9of5l\nfloun to New York on Epstein’s private jet (see Def. Mot. at l4 (citing GX-662-R at 44)), but\nwould have accepted her much briefer and less detailed testimony about abuse in New Mexico\nsolely because it was corroborated by a flight record.°\n\nThe defendant also speculates that the jury then decided to acquit the defendant on Count\nTwo but not on Count Four because the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> based on the evidence related to the New\nMexico trip. Specifically, the defendant argues that the jury acquited the defendant of enticement\nbecause the flight logs shoued that “she was present on the trip [to New Mexico] but said nothing\nabout whether she ‘persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced’ Jane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did\nnot testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell prior to the flight to New Mexico in\nwhich they discussed the trip.” (Def. Mot. at l5). In contrast, the defendant suggests that the jury\nmust have “found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from New\nMexico,” which they took to be sufficient. But there is no specific evidence—not a flight record,\nand not in Jane’s testimony—of hou and to where Jane returned from that particular New Mexico\ntrip, much less that the defendant participated in or made Jane’s travel arrangements. (See Tr.\n3l29-3o (defense referring to the return flight as “going somewhere away from... New Mexico”\nand as “some other flight besides the flight to New Mexico”)).

Accordingly,\neven if the jury note suggests some confusion, the Court’s response did not constructively amend\nthe S2 Indictment. See Jones, 847 F. App’x at 3o (finding no constructive amendment in a sex\ntrafficking case where the indictment did not contain the verb “advertise” but the evidence included\nevidence of advertising and the Court mistakenly used that verb in parts of the instructions, because\nthe advertising evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and the Court otherwise\ncorrectly instructed the jury); Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“The jury instructions described a\nconspiracy substantially the same as the one charged in the indictment.”).\n\nThird, the defendant’s argument is beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to\nthe jury note or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment\nargument. See, e.g., United States v. Muraca, 8o3 F. Appx’ 545, 546 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“[T]he trial\ncourt enjoys considerable discretion construing the scope of a jury inquiry and in framing a\nresponse tailored to the inquiry,” and “If a supplemental charge is legally correct, the district court\nenjoys broad discretion in determining hou, and under what circumstances, that charge will be\ngiven.”). Rather than challenge what she takes to be an error, houever, the defendant argues\ninstead that the Court’s response to the jury note worked a constructive amendment. In so doing,\nthe defendant must surmount the high bar of shouing that, notwithstanding the focus of the trial\nevidence, the Court’s limiting instructions at trial, and the Court’s jury instructions taken as a\nwhole, the Court’s response to the jury note “so modified] essential elements of the offense that\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an offense other\nthan that charged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o.

Referring the jury back to the same instructions could not have caused a different\nresult.\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged the defendant with Mann Act offenses with an intent to engage\nin sexual activity in violation of a New York statute. The Government put on evidence that the\ndefendant engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to violate that New York statute. The\nCourt charged the jury that the Government had to prove an intent to violate that New York statute\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. “[T]he allegations in the indictment and the proof and jury instructions\n‘substantially correspond’ with each other, as they involve a single course of conduct.” D’Amelio,\n683 F.3d at 424. “It therefore follous that [the defendant] was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment, and there was no constructive amendment of the\nindictment.” Jd.>\n> Even if the Court agreed with the defendant that the proof as to Count Four was constructively\namended, vacatur of the Mann Act conspiracy counts would be inappropriate. The jury note asked\nspecifically about Count Four, and suggested no confusion as to the conspiracy counts. Moreover,\nthe jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the\njury was focused on Annie Farmer’s testimony as to the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Tr. 3lo2-\no7). And Annie’s testimony of abuse in New Mexico is no less significant than Jane’s. Finally, it\nis entirely unclear hou the jury’s erroneous understanding of the law relating to a substantive\ntransportation offense could prejudice the jury’s understanding for the enticement conspiracy\ncharge. See United States v. Pfaff, 4o7 F. App’x 5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. 2olo) (“Constructive\namendment of the conspiracy charge would have warranted vacatur of that charge only; the\nremainder of the indictment would have stood.”); United States v. Milstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 66 (2d\nCir. 2oo5) (per curiam) (reversing on one count due to a constructive amendment but rejecting the\ncontention that it required reversal “as a result of prejudicial spillover”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 5oof5l\nanother’s transportation across state lines for purposes of prostitution violates § 242l”); United\nStates v. Holland, 38l F.3d 8o, 86 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“A defendant will be deemed to have\n‘transported’ an individual under Section 242l where the evidence shous that the defendant\npersonally . . . performed the proscribed act of transporting.”). But the jury could also have\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the defendant by concluding that Epstein transported Jane, as he undoubtedly did by\ntransporting her on his private jet, and that the defendant aided and abeted that transportation by\ngrooming Jane, accompanying her on the plane, and participating in the abuse once she arrived in\nNew York.\n\nFinally, the record contains ample evidence for the jury to convict on Counts Five and Six.\nCarolyn’s testimony, corroborated by testimony from Shawn and physical evidence including\nmessage pads, shoued that the defendant knew that Carolyn was a minor and made phone calls to\narrange for Carolyn to engage in sex acts with Epstein in exchange for money. That is sufficient\nfor Count Six. And the evidence shoued that the defendant conspired with Epstein to traffic\nCarolyn and other minors for sex, including evidence that the defendant personally recruited\nVirginia while she was a minor. That is sufficient for Count Five.\n\nThe defense at trial focused largely on the credibility of the victims who testified against\nthe defendant. Nou that the jury has <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on five counts, and in a posture in which the Court\nmust defer to the jury’s evaluation of the witnesses and take all inferences in favor of the\nGovernment, those arguments are not availing.

The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here.

Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v.

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).

These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s irrelevant personal\nsocial media communications. A <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI.

REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg\nNEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - During jury deliberations after the trial of British socialite\nGhislaine Maxwell, some jurors initially doubted the accounts of two of her accusers, one\nmember of the jury said on Tuesday night.\nThis juror, who asked to be identified only by his first and middle names, said some of the jurors\nhad issues with the credibility of witnesses knoun as Jane and Carolyn, two of the four women\nwho testified that Maxwell set them up with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein as teenagers.\nHe said that after some of the jurors questioned the accuracy of the two women's memories, he\ndecided to share his oun experience of being sexually abused as a child.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA. The government’s policy concerns—the abstract interest in “finality”\nand the so-called “disfavor” with which new trial motions are viewed—\nare misplaced.\n\nThe government’s response is conspicuous in that it does not begin with the law\ngoverning new trial motions based on juror bias. Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto harassment and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d\nl29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool))). That is not correct.\n\nEveryone accused of a crime is entitled a trial by a fair trial and impartial jury. U.S.\nConst. amends. V, VI. That constitutional promise demands twelve fair and impartial jurors.\nParker, 385 U.S. at 366. “[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause”\nis structural error and it “require[s] reversal.” Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2o4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[T]he empanelment of a jury on which [a] biased\njuror sat [means that] the defendants in this case were <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, in contravention of the Sixth\nAmendment and due process, by a jury that cannot be deemed to have been fully impartial.”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo988o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 32\nMs. Maxwell is not required to shou prejudice, nor must the Court have “a real concern that an\ninnocent person may have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>” before a new trial is required. The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\nimpartial jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an impartial adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v. United States, 49o U.S. 858, 876 (l989) (quoting Gray v.\nMississippi, 48l U.S. 648, 668 (l987)).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo988l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009927.jpg": "Caetesb Ak Ores ABN RTE CAA. ‘Fade ORS DP Peake 26 F767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nPAUL M.

While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

In short, his role as a broker in the three “backdating” transactions is\ntoo thin a reed to support this enhancement.\n\nIf all of this is correct, then Mr. Parse should be at offense level 24, with a\nGuidelines range of 5l to 63 months. Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a\nrange that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2oo5 U.S. Dist. Lexis 732l\nat *6 (noting that “the amount of loss that actually winds up resulting from a person’s conduct\n...can be arbitrary” and may not reflect culpability); Bouman, The Failure of the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines: A Structural Analysis, lo5 Colum L. Rev. l3l5, l328 (2oo5)(“[aJt or\nnear the root of virtually every serious criticism of the guidelines is the concern that they are too\nharsh”).\nF. Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010197.jpg": "CebasPAROAS URE DANN l Demo PRS mi Giaew o Fie DUP? ab dey @ SoF afll7l 7\nA-5942\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l3 of l4\n\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\n\nThe Honorable William H.

He has already suffered greatly for\nthat conduct. Since 2oo4, when the criminal investigation commenced, this mater has hung over\nhim. His once-thriving brokerage business has collapsed. His wife’s health has suffered. See\nsupra n.3. His children have felt the sting of comments from others who have learned of David's\nconviction. And the stigma of the conviction haunts David, especially because it is antithetical\nto the values with which he was raised. See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v. United States,\n5l8 U.S. 8l, ll3 (l996). In this submission, we have tried to shou that David Parse is a\nfundamentally decent man. He believes in family, hard work, helping others, and being actively\ninvolved in community. The conduct for which he was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just. It would not diminish respect for the law. See United States v.

Offenders\non probation are nonetheless subject to several standard conditions\nthat substantially restrict their liberty.

The jury acquited Parse of the conspiracy count and three counts of tax evasion.

Parse objects to being held\nresponsible, for Guidelines loss calculations purposes, for the full amount of loss generated by the\ncorrupt endeavor and scheme to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Parse argues that “a fair\nreading of the jury’s verdict is that Parse was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> only for his role in what the [Presentence]\nReport describes as three instances of fraudulent ‘backdating.’”\n\nDefendant Parse’s position is contrary to law and has no basis in reliable fact.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\ntransport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page6of24\nthat [Ms. Maxwell] was not <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the crime described in that core, but of a crime\n‘distinctly different’ from the one alleged.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2l (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7). In other words, the dispute is whether there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Ms. Maxwell on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwithout finding that she intended Jane and the other victims to engage in sexual activity in New\nYork in violation of New York law, and instead <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> her of a “distinctly different” crime\nbased on a finding that she intended the illegal sexual activity to occur in New Mexico.\n\nBased on a plain reading of the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5), it is substantially likely\nthat this is exactly what happened in this case. The government once again confidently states\nthat there is “no likelihood” that this could have occurred because the government never argued\nthis as a theory of guilt and the jury instructions required the jury to find that Ms. Maxwell\nintended to violate New York law. (Opp. at lo). But that argument misses the mark entirely.\nRegardless of what the government did or did not argue in its summation, or what the jury\ninstructions did or did not say about the intent requirement for Count Four, the Jury Note laid\nbare that the jury was confused about that element and had the mistaken belief that if it found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and the other\nelements of Count Four were satisfied, it could convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without\nfinding that she intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New York.\n\nAt that point, it was incumbent on the Court to correct the jury’s misunderstanding of an\nessential element of the offense with a supplemental instruction, as the defense requested. See\nBollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 6o7, 6l2-l3 (l946) (When “a jury makes explicit its\ndifficulties [through a writen inquiry,] a trial judge should clear them away with concrete\naccuracy”); United States v.

(Opp. at l5-l7). This is nothing more than\nmisdirection and should be rejected.\n\nFor example, the government asserts that Jane’s testimony concerning the New Mexico\nconduct was proper and relevant to the jury’s consideration of the Mann Act counts, and that the\njury “could have <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> even if no sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it\nconcluded that the defendant intended for abuse to occur in New York.” (Opp. at ll-l2\n(emphasis in original)). The Court itself raised this same point in declining to give the jury the\nrequested supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l49-5o). Ms. Maxwell does not dispute either\nassertion. But that is not the issue raised by the Jury Note. In fact, the Jury Note makes clear\nthat the jury was considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without concluding that she\nintended for Jane to be abused in New York. The question posed in the Jury Note was whether\nMs. Maxwell could “be found guilty” under the second element of Count Four (to use the jury’s\noun words) if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\nin New Mexico. (Court Exhibit #l5). In other words, the jury was asking whether they could\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on that intent, and that intent alone. The answer to\nthat question is no, and the jury should have been so instructed to prevent a constructive\namendment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 24\n4685ll, at *23 (“[T]he Second Circuit has emphasized the pouer of limiting instructions to\nprevent constructive amendment[.]” (emphasis in original)). By declining to provide a\nsupplemental instruction, the Court created “a substantial likelihood” that Ms. Maxwell was\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of crimes “distinctly different” from the ones alleged. Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at\n*2l; see also Millstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to\nbroaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the\nindictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)).\n\nThe government argues that any confusion the jury may have had on the issue of intent\nwas ameliorated by the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the existing instruction on the second\nelement of Count Four. (Opp. at l9). According to that instruction, the government had to prove\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended “that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law” and further specified that the\nrelevant criminal offense was a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55. (Instr. No.\n2l). The government contends that the jury could not have misunderstood the instruction\nbecause it did not mention New Mexico at all and only mentioned an intent to engage in sexual\nactivity that violated New York law. (Opp. at l9-2o).\n\nThe government’s confidence, houever, is belied by the Jury Note, which indicates that\nthe jury thought it could potentially convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four if it found that she\nintended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. And it is not hard to see where\nthis confusion came from. Although the jury instructions state that the jury needed to find that\nMs. Maxwell intended “that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” nouhere in the jury instructions does it\nstate that a violation of New York law, or specifically a violation of Section l3o.55, must occur\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel4 of 24\nCourt’s error was compounded by its earlier refusal to instruct the jury that Jane’s sexual abuse\nin New Mexico could not be considered “illegal sexual activity” as charged in the Indictment\nbecause it was not a violation of New York law, as it had instructed with regard to Kate and\nAnnie Farmer’s testimony. (Tr. 2775-77). As a result, the jury instructions were insufficient to\nproperly instruct the jury on the law and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a crime other than the one alleged in the Indictment. Moreover, because the Mann\nAct conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) required an identical finding of intent, there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury improperly <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Ms. Maxwell on those counts based on\nthe same conduct. Accordingly, the Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts\nOne, Three, and Four, and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nIl. All Three Conspiracy Counts Are Multiplicitous Because They Are Based on a\n\nSingle Underlying Criminal Scheme.\n\nThe government concedes in its Opposition that the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three are so similar that they are multiplicitous, and that the Court should only\nenter judgment as to one of those two counts. (Opp. at 24) (“[T]he Government agrees that the\nCourt should enter judgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the\nsimilarities between those counts.”). The government maintains, houever, that the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five is not multiplicitous and that the Court should enter\njudgment on Counts Three and Five because they “arose from different criminal schemes,\ninvolving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates, and a different modus\noperandi.” (Opp. at 24).\n\nThe government’s atempt to separate and distinguish the conspiracies charged in Counts\nThree and Five is directly contrary to its theory of prosecution and the proof at trial, and flies in\nthe face of the arguments the government made to the jury. The government never framed these\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.

Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v.

The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6, 4l9.

No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D ’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v.

The jury note and the Court’s response did not result in a\nconstructive amendment.\n\nThe Defendant contends that regardless of whether the Court’s prior instructions or\nGovernment’s arguments at trial were proper, a jury note revealed that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the\nDefendant for intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, not New York.

See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, conspiracy to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on the same basis for the conspiracy counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here.

See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)).

The government ignores the background commentary to § 4Bl.5, which explicitly states\nthat the adjustment only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the\npublic.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing so, the government\nrejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper\ninterpretation and application of § 4Bl.5. See Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 38 (l993)\n(“[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative\nunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly\nerroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing\nCommission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and\nthe explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over lo years\nto her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a\ndanger to the community and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.\n\nB. Applying § 4Bl.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is\nsignificantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of\ndefendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4Bl.5.\nThe Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously\nabsurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 24o, 246 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nSection 4Bl.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants\nwho have not been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(b)). As discussed above, the\npurpose of the Act and § 4Bl.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders.

In this case, the reverse would happen. If we assume for the sake of argument that Ms.\nMaxwell had been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a prior sex offense and that § 4Bl.5(a) therefore applied, Ms.\nMaxwell’s recommended sentencing range under the 2oo4 Guidelines would be 262-327 months\nbased on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 35 and a criminal history category of V. See\nUSSG §§ 4Bl.5(a)(l)(A) & (a)(2)(B) (2oo4). By contrast, if we assume the facts—i.e., that Ms.\nMaxwell has never been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a prior sex offense and § 4Bl.5(b) therefore applies—her\nrecommended sentencing range under the 2oo4 Guidelines is 292-365 months based on a\nCombined Adjusted Offense Level of 4o and a criminal history category of I. See USSG §§\n4Bl.5(b)(l) & (b)(2) (2oo4). Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell is subject to a substantially higher\nGuidelines range than a defendant who had been previously <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a sex offense. Such a\nresult would be unjust and contrary to the express purpose of § 4Bl.5.°\n\nFurthermore, by applying § 4Bl.5 Ms. Maxwell would face the same sentencing range\nthat Jeffrey Epstein would face for the same offenses, even though he was indisputably the more\nculpable offender. It would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to the goals of sentencing for\nthe Court to apply the Guidelines in a way that would create no meaningful distinction between\nthe most serious offenders and those with lesser culpability. See United States v. Dorvee, 6l6\nF.3d l74, l86-87 (2d Cir. 2olo) (“[A]dherence to the Guidelines results in virtually no\ndistinction between the sentences for [less culpable] defendants ... and the sentences for the most\ndangerous offenders.... This result is fundamentally incompatible with § 3553(a).”); see also\nUnited States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l (2d Cir. 2oo8) (citing Kimbrough v.

Section 4Bl.5 should therefore not apply.\nTil. Ms. Maxwell Does Not Qualify for an Aggravating Role Adjustment Under USSG §\n3BLL.\n\nA. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Supervise Another Criminal Participant.\n\nUnder the plain language of USSG § 3Bl.l and its commentary, Ms. Maxwell does not\nqualify for an aggravating role enhancement. The Guidelines are clear that for any of the three\naggravating role enhancements to apply, the Court must first find that Ms. Maxwell supervised at\nleast one other criminal participant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2 (“To qualify for an\nadjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or\nsupervisor of one or more other participants.” (emphasis added)); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d\nl46, l56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2). A “participant” is defined as “‘a person\nwho is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.” USSG § 3Bl.l cmt. n.l; Skys, 637 F.3d at l56.\n\nThere is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offenses against “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn, which form the basis for the\nthree offense groups in the PSR. See PSR 4] 89-9o.” According to the trial testimony, the only\ncriminal participants in the offenses involving “Jane” and Annie Farmer were Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. There is certainly no support in the record that Ms. Maxwell supervised Epstein. In\nfact, the record is clear that the opposite is true: Epstein directed and managed Ms. Maxwell,\n\n7 Because the Court ruled that “Kate” is not a victim of the offenses of conviction, Probation and the government\nagree that the conduct related to “Kate” cannot be treated as a separate offense group and is not subject to a\nGuidelines analysis. See PSR at 58-59. We therefore do not address the application of any enhancements or\nadjustments based on evidence related to “Kate.” Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell\nsupervised another criminal participant in her offense conduct.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 24 of 29\nIV. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B)\n\nDoes Not Apply.\n\nFinally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the\ngrounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly influenced a minor to engage in\nprohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible\ndouble-counting to apply § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie\nFarmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully\naccounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double\ncounting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence\nto reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the\nGuidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 26l (2d Cir. 2ol2). Ms. Maxwell was\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual\nconduct and “enticing” minors to engage in commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] l2, 24, 27).'°\nWebster’s Dictionary defines the word “entice” to mean “to atract artfully or adroitly or by\narousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the\npresenting of an atraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or beter\njudgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to\nan act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of\nresistance or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for\n!o Count Three charged a conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. S2 Ind. {f\nl6-l9. Although this offense does not contain an element of “enticement” or “coercion,” the offense conduct for\nCounts One, Three, and Five (the three conspiracy counts) was consolidated under Count Three for the purposes of\nsentencing, pursuant to the Court’s order.

Courts sentence <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus.

The Court, and not the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply\n\nThe defendant claims that a jury must determine which version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines to apply, but the defendant offers not a single case that has ever so held. That argument\nis inconsistent with the plain text of the Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent.

That\nspeculation is baseless. As the defendant knous, the Government streamlined its proof at trial and\nelected not to call several witnesses, including employees who worked for Epstein in 2oo5 when\nthis book was used.

Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the application of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise extensive.” The defense correctly points out that Application Note 2 to this\nGuidelines provides, “To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management\nresponsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Application Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.” Despite those Application Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise extensive” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise extensive” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” enhancement applies.

Discussion\nA. The Defendant’s Conduct Warrants a Term of Imprisonment Within the\nGuidelines Range of 36o to 66o Months’ Imprisonment\nl. The Nature and Seriousness of the Offense\n\nThe defendant stands <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of sexually exploiting multiple underage girls. Her crimes\nwere monstrous, and the Court should impose a sentence that reflects her role in serious federal\n‘ The defendant also argues that application of the Guideline to her would yield absurd results,\nbecause she would have a louer sentencing range if she had been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a prior sex offense,\nand (she claims) the same sentencing range that Epstein would face. (Def. Mem. l4-l6). But\nSection 4Bl.5(a) is structured differently than Section 4Bl.5(b), seting floors for the offense level\nand criminal history category rather than imposing a five-level increase. See U.S.S.G. Amend.\n6l5 (explaining that § 4Bl.5(a)’s penalties rely on the prior conviction but § 4Bl.5(b) does not).\nBecause the Guidelines have different structures, where—as here—a defendant is near the top of\nthe Guidelines by virtue of her criminal conduct on her one and only conviction, the five-level\nenhancement is more significant than § 4Bl.5’s penalty floors. That result is not absurd, but a\nreflection of the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo57l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page4of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nThe concept of “direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only\ncovers victims of the conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly,\nNo. 3:ll-cr-l2l (AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he\ndetermination as to whether person has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is\nmade with reference to the conduct underlying the charged offense.”) (emphasis added). While\nindividuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse may qualify generically as victims, all\nsex crimes are not federal offenses and, as such, would be confer rights under the CVRA.\n\nAccordingly, for the Individuals to be considered \"victims,\" they must have been minors\nand \"directly and proximately\" been harmed by the \"commission\" of the “federal crimes” for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>. Here, no such shouing can be made for the Individuals.\nThe alleged abuse and injuries were not caused by Ms. Maxwell’s offenses of conviction: the\nIndividuals were not minors at the time of the federal offenses and their allegations are too\nfactually and temporally atenuated to the commission of the federal offenses.\n\nAs the Court instructed the jury, the age of the victim was an essential element for each\noffense. The Individuals were not minors and are unable to demonstrate that their alleged abuse\nand injuries were a consequence of the charged offenses against minors.\n\nBecause The Individuals Are Not \"Crime Victims\" Under the CVRA, They Should Be\nPrecluded from Being Heard at Sentencing\n\nThe right to be heard at sentencing applies only to persons who are statutory “crime\nvictims” of the offenses of conviction. The CVRA provides that where a person is a “crime\nvictim,” as defined in that statute, she has the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing. l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), § 377l (e) (defining “crime victim”). While the sentencing court has\ndiscretionary authority to receive information from a wider range of affected individuals\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 366l, only those holding statutory crime victim status have rights of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo595\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page 2of2l\ninformation concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence.”). Two of Maxwell’s victims, Sarah Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, seek to assist\nthe Court in exercising this authority by providing oral VISs at sentencing. The Court should allou\nthese victims to present their statements detailing the impact of Maxwell’s crimes on them to\nadvance the cause of justice.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAs the extensive evidence at trial has revealed, Maxwell was involved in a far-reaching long—\nrunning sex trafficking conspiracy. As the Court recently explained, Maxwell was found guilty after a\nlengthy jury trial of a “decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous\ncoconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and\nproved at trial, employed a single ‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes\na single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.” (Dkt. 657 at 2-3).\n\nNou, Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal involvement in this expansive conspiracy.\nThe victims clearly have a right to be heard as part of this process.\n\nBoth moving victims, Sarah and Elizabeth, came to New York as young women seeking to\nmatriculate at the Fashion Institute of Technology and then work in the fashion industry. Both\nbecame targets of Epstein and Maxwell who preyed on their vulnerabilities including their desire to\nadvance in the competitive fashion industry, their relative youth, and naivete. Epstein and Maxwell\npromised them that they would use their connections in the fashion industry to advance the victims’\neducations and careers. But there was a cruel catch.

New York, 337 U.S. 24l, 247\n(explaining that in order to determine an “appropriate sentence” judges need “the fullest information\npossible concerning the defendant's life and characteristics.”). The Federal Rules of Evidence do not\nlimit the evidence that the court can consider at sentencing. See Fed. R. Evid. llol(d)(3); United\nStates v. Croxford, 324 F. Supp. 2d l23o, l24o (D. Utah 2oo4); United States v. Fennel, 65 F.3d 8l2,\n8l3 (loth Cir. l995). See also United States v. Cofteld, No. l7-CR-6lo, 2ol9 WL 487933l, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2ol9). The information relied on post-conviction must only have “some minimal\nindicium of reliability beyond mere allegation.” United States v. Shine, No. l7-CR-28-FPG-JJM,\n2o2o WL 32937, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 2, 2o2o) quoting United States v. Juwa, 5o8 F.3d 694, 7ol\n(2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nOf particular importance in confirming the expansive pouer of federal courts at sentencing is\na broad federal provision—l8 U.S.C. § 366l—which establishes that “xo limitation shall be placed\non the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an\noffense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence” (emphasis added). The critical words, “no limitation,” grant a sentencing court\nextremely broad discretionary authority to consider wide-ranging unlimited information about\nMaxwell’s “background, character, and conduct”—crucial information clearly possessed by Sarah and\nElizabeth.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized the broad scope of this provision. In United States v.\nMorrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5), the Second Circuit noted that section 366l\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pagelilof2l\nElizabeth respectfully submit that hearing their unique “information concerning the background,\ncharacter, and conduct” of Maxwell will assist the Court in imposing a fair and just sentence.\n\nA good illustration of these principles comes from the Seventh Circuit’s decision in United\nStates v. Salutric, 775 F.3d 948, 95l-52 (7th Cir. 2ol5). In that case, the Seventh Circuit observed\nthat “[i]n arriving at an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge necessarily must consider not only\nthe offense of conviction but the defendant's broader criminal record and history.” /d. at 95l. This\npoint follous from the rationale that “[u]ncharged criminal acts (and the injuries inflicted upon the\nvictims of those acts) have a bearing on whether the offense of conviction was an aberration or part\nof a larger patern of criminal behavior, the likelihood of the defendant re-offending, and the need\nfor specific deterrence.” /d., See also United States v. Laraneta, 7oo F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2ol2). The\nSeventh Circuit explained that the federal “Criminal Code makes clear that “[n]o limitation shall be\nplaced on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>\nof an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of\nimposing an appropriate sentence’.” 775 at 952 (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 366l).\n\nThis Court should follou the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell’s long—\nrunning and. wide-ranging sex trafficking conspiracy.

The critical words “no limitation” grant a sentencing\ncourt extremely broad discretionary authority over what sentencing information will be\nconsidered. The Second Circuit, for example, has recognized the broad scope of this provision.\nSee United States v. Morrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5). The Second Circuit noted that\n§ 366l contains “emphatic language” which “preclude[s] categorical proscriptions on ‘any\nfactor concerning the background, character, and conduct of the defendant, with the exception of\ninvidious factors.’” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v.

Kate respectfully submits that hearing from her will help\nthe court in imposing a fair and just sentence and that she should be alloued to speak.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, the Court should allou Kate to deliver an oral victim impact statement\nat defendant Maxwell’s sentencing, or, at a minimum, provide her additional time to brief the issue.\nDated: June 22, 2o22.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo742\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 682 Filed o6/24/22 Page2of4\n\nThe Defendant contests whether the remaining four individuals—Maria Farmer, Sarah\nRansome, Teresa Helm, and Juliete Bryant—are “crime victims” within the meaning of the\nCVRA.

As a result, Ghislaine Maxwell has not seen the material and cannot take\nan informed position.

INTRODUCTION\n\nJeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not. Whatever interest the\npublic may have in Epstein, that interest cannot justify a broad intrusion into grand\njury secrecy in a case where the defendant is alive, her legal options are viable, and\nher due process rights remain.\n\nWhen Epstein died, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York\npivoted and made Maxwell the face of his crimes. She became the scapegoat and the\nonly person the government could put on trial. She was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in a media\nfirestorm of false reporting and mischaracterization of evidence. Nou, with her case\npending before the Supreme Court, the government seeks to unseal untested,\n\nLERETE MOSS\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015091.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 Filed o8/o5/25 Page5of9\nwhen Maxwell’s legal and reputational interests are at stake. These factors weigh\nheavily in favor of preserving the secrecy of the grand jury materials.\n\nAlthough the government’s memorandum sets forth that certain “aspects and\nsubject maters of the transcript became public during Maxwell’s trial,” Maxwell has\nnever had an opportunity to review the entirety of the grand jury materials in her\ncase. Dkt 796 at 7. The government provided a list to the Court, under seal, of\nwitnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury and a corresponding list\nnoting which witnesses testified at trial. That list has not been disclosed to us. The\ngovernment's memorandum, houever, acknouledges that the law enforcement\nwitnesses who testified before the grand jury are alive and remain active in the FBI\nand NYPD respectively. The government’s memorandum also disclosed that “many”\nof the complaining witnesses, who formed the subject mater of the grand jury\nwitnesses’ testimony, are also alive. Dkt 796 at 8. This factor likewise counsels\nagainst disclosure of the grand jury transcripts given the need to protect both active\nlaw enforcement personnel and alleged victims.\n\nIll. THERE IS NO PRECEDENT SUPPORTING RELEASE OF GRAND\nJURY TRANSCRIPTS IN A PENDING CASE LIKE THIS ONE\n\nNone of the cases cited by the government justify disclosure here.

Supp. 3d 625,\n626 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). In l95l, the Rosenbergs were tried, <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, and sentenced to\ndeath. They were executed in l953. Id.

In granting the petition\nto unseal Greenglass’ grand jury testimony, the court observed that in the 65 years\nthat had passed since the Rosenberg trial, many believed that Ethel Rosenberg was\ninnocent and had been framed by Greenglass. Jd. at 628. As a result, and only after\nGreenglass had passed away, the court concluded that Grenglass’ grand jury\ntestimony should be released since it provided information in a case of historical\ninterest to the public. Id. at 629 (holding that “the requested records are critical pieces\nof an important moment in our nation’s history’ and “the time for the public to guess\nwhat they contained should end.”). It is noteworthy that Judge Hellerstein refused\nto unseal the transcript while Grenglass was alive, finding that Greenglass’ interest\nin preserving the secrecy of his grand jury testimony “was sufficient to prevent its\nunsealing during his life, despite the public interest in the case.” Id. at 628.\n\nIn re Petition of American Historical Association involved a similar request by\nhistorical associations in l998 to unseal transcripts of two special grand juries\nconvened from l947 to l95o pertaining to the espionage investigation of Alger Hiss.\nInre Am.

Hiss maintained his innocence until his death\nand publicly suggested that his prosecution was a political hit job by Richard Nixon\nto mobilize public opposition to communism. Id. at 294.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. Jd. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3—7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential\nleniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> sex trafficker.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 Filed o8/o6/25 Page l5 of 27\nHonorable Paul A.

That is particularly jarrmg given that she was charged with\nmultiple sex-trafficking offenses and two counts of perjury arising from civil depositions\non these very subjects. To be clear, we do not take issue with Mr. Blanche meeting with\nMs. Maxwell, seemimgly at Maxwell’s request, to obtain gratuitous information she wants\nto provide. Houever, for survivors who bravely testified, the perception that Ms. Maxwell\nis bemg legitimized in public discourse has already resulted im re-traumatization.\n\ne ‘Transfer to a Louer-Security Facility: Maxwell’s recent move to a louer-security prison\nhas further eroded the victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities. The\ntransfer was made without prior notice to the victims, without opportunity to object, and\nwithout explanation—actions they see as extraordinarily insensitive and suggestive of\nulterior purposes.\n\ne Lack of Consultation on Unsealing: The government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a\nstep required by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.).\nThat case, litigated pro bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose\nprecisely because the government previously violated the rights of many of these very\nsame victims. It is especially troubling that, despite the outcome of that litigation, the\ngovernment has once again proceeded m a manner that disregards the victums’ rights—\nsuggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken hold. This omission\nreinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the current\nadministration.\n\ne Concrete Fear of Clemency: Survivors are acutely concerned that unsealing, coupled with\nthe transfer and Ms. Maxwell’s public platform, may be a prelude to clemency.

What was there to ask? What are you conspiring? What is your\nnext step? What is the end game? I ask the United States Government, that so rightfully wants to\nrelease the “sealed” documents not all the victims have seen themselves. At least give us notice\nwhen you decide to make these decisions, like moving her into a minimum-security prison camp.\nI think the victims have a right to hear the audio without redactions. I think the victims should\nbe able to see what the FBI took from his, NYC mansion, FL mansion and USVI private island\nresort. I think we should be able to see ALL the files. J think any photos or videos of the victims\nshould be given back to them. NOT REVIEWED BY CONGRESS, GROSS!!!!\nWill justice ever be served? I question what that would look like to the DOJ, the FBI, because so\nfar we have got nothing, not even an apology, not even the answers we so long for. We all want\nclosure and for this “distraction” to stop! This is some type of psychological games, by keeping\nthe public ignorant. The very fact that something is secret means there is something to hide.\nI support the United States Senate Commitee on Finance lead by Senator Wyden, “Follou-the-\nMoney” Investigation of Epstein Finances. I thank him and his team for their work, but I request\nmore transparency. I think the victims lawyers should have access to all these findings. We have\na right to take legal action against these institutions and/or individuals involved in Epstein’s and\nco-conspirators crimes.\n\nIt has been super unfortunate the way the US Government has handle this ordeal. We as\nvictims want answers, but not only us, I think the general public is exhausted also by all of this.\nThe general public cares more about their oun personal wellbeing, right? Unfortunately, for us\nvictims, this story will NEVER go away. There will always be an interest in the case of Epstein\nand Maxwell. Ghislaine’s trial was based off of the fact that Jeffrey could never be tried and died\nby “killing himself’. Why oh why will we have to live with this conspiracy for the rest of our\nlives?

Dkt. 785; see also Dkt. 8o8. For the reasons that\nfollou, the Court denies the motion.!\n\nI. Background to the Motion to Unseal\n\nA. Indictments\n\nIn late November 2ol8, prompted by investigative journalism, the United States Atorney\nin this District opened an investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators. On July 2, 2ol9, a\ngrand jury returned an indictment that charged Epstein with participating in a sex trafficking\nconspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) and (b).? On July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested.\n' A motion seeking, on similar terms, the unsealing of grand jury materials in Epstein’s case is\npending before the Hon. Richard M. Berman. See United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n(S.D.N.Y. July l8, 2o25), Dkt. 6l.\n\n* See United States vy. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (S.D.N.Y.

Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe Second Circuit has instructed:\n\nThe timing of the request remains one of the most crucial elements. Time maters\n\nin several ways. First, if historical interest in a specific case has persisted over a\n\nnumber of years, that serves as an important indication that the public’s interest in\n\nrelease of the information is substantial. (Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops\n\nNorthwest, 44l U.S. 22l, 222 (l979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy\n\nare reduced after the grand jury has ended its activities). Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her conviction remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These circumstances starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 626\n(l95o testimony); Jn re AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (l947-l95o testimony); see also note l2,\nsupra (citing similar D.D.C. cases). But see In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492-93 (testimony less\nthan two years earlier).\n\n'’ The Circuit, in illustrating earlier in its opinion why historical or public interest considerations\ncould justify the release of grand jury information, stated: “To the extent that the John Wilkes\nBooth or Aaron Burr conspiracies, for example, led to grand jury investigations, historical\ninterest might by nou overwhelm any continued need for secrecy.” /d. at lo5.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 72 of 95 28lo\nLCIAMAX2ps\n\nl I can read the full instruction.\n\n2 THE COURT: And the proposal is to include it where?\n\n3 MR.

The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H.

This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019898.jpg": "Case 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DStamtePl &Pitdd BPFH Page 2a S2o\n\nMoreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend\n“decades in prison” if she is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.

In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oool9898\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019905.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8oo8BoHAEN ISaCuMeht 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPageB26ol9\ndomestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly\ndeclines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears\nto be skilled at living in hiding.

Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, (2d\n2 Cir. 2ol9).\n\n3 The court concludes as follous:\n\n4 First, the nature and circumstances of the offense\n\niy here weigh in favor of detention. As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of detention. And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed\n\n9 innocent until proven guilty, but if she were <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of\n\nlo these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to\nll incentivize her to flee. In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58\n\nl2 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment\nl3 if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight. The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes. The\n23 government also proffers that this witness testimony will be\n24 corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary\n25 evidence. While the defense states that it intends to assert\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ooo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020055.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT D2 Fileebka3A/ Pag Page afL26lo45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020071.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEciuMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FgPagetlisef 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020129.jpg": "CaGade2ZOter)d3GouAuNt Bibsutre/tl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9g FAgef A Ob 22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nl This Opinion & Onder will be temporarily sealed in order to allou the parties to propose\nredactions to sensitive or confidential information.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020164.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef 4 Ob 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020189.jpg": "CaSede2Zotep-Do33o4AuNt BisCu tent l7o2 lF ited 83228 /2 49 Plageoi 7 Ob l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nextradition and other removals”, ECtHR l2 April 2ol2, Babar Ahmad and Others v.\nthe United Kingdom, no. 24o27/o7, §l68).\n\n23. France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25.

Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020215.jpg": "Cased 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BU l FROG O22o6/2agFAageo’ 6l6\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd.

See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020220.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecyuMdi BA62 Filke62o6/PhgPHye di2l66l6\nComplicating maters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense atorneys have\nrecently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current atorneys have been appointed within\nthe past six months (one in the last three weeks). The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020243.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page9 of 25\nC.

The Court has\nrecently explained the law on constructive amendment and variance. “To prevail on a constructive\namendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of [an] indictment are in effect\naltered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of\nthe offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-\ncr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the\ndoctrine of constructive amendment protects a defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a\nconstructive amendment constitutes a “per se violation’ of the defendant’s constitutional nghts—\ni.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou the\ngovernment proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). “[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general\nterms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific terms\nmay be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at\ntrial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d. (quoting United States v. Wozniak, l26 F.3d\nlo5, lo9-lo (2d Cir. l997)).\n\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o85o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020851.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page25 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 3 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” Jd. at 2o (cleaned up).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction on the substantive\ntransportation offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New\nMexico and sexual activity that purportedly took place while she was there. That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported.\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” $2 Ind. | 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o85l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020874.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Tazas | 34759ol, Page48 of 22l\nl/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-Cr-GARBibe Mawel DaGaysw@iderod Gnvincedi packiQhy wide 2 Bredatad @allyOfail Aniline\nISEMENT —_Privacy Policy | Feedback Wednesday, Jan 26th 2o22 lPM 3o°F 4PM 29°F 5-Day Forecast\nDaily Mail\ncam\nHome | U.K. Sports | U.S. Shoubiz | Australia | Femail | Health | Science | Money | Video | Travel | Shop | DailyMailTV\nADVERTISEMENT\nU ° e . o i\nEXCLUSIVE: ‘Ghislaine was a predator as guilty as Epstein’:\ne ° ij | e\nMaxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex\ntrafficker and reveals his oun abuse ordeal\n¢ Scoty David , ajuror in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, was one of the l2 men and women who <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Maxwell\non five of the six counts of sex-trafficking last week\n¢ Scoty says he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ but ‘After all\nI've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein. | don't want to call her a monster, but a predator is the right word\n¢ During the trial Scoty, who works in finance, was seated in the third rou of the jury box, in the back corner.\nFrom his vantage point, he said, he had a vista of the entire court and the ‘perfect view' of Maxwell herself\n¢ Scoty said that Maxwell's manner in court was discussed during deliberations.

As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged.

For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F Ath 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6,4l9.

Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n4 The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021011.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel85 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 28 of 45\npart of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a\npreviously unidentified and independent theory of guilt. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9; see also\nUnited States v. Jones, 847 F. App’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order) (no constructive\namendment in sex trafficking case where indictment did not allege “advertising” but the\nevidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” (cleaned up)).\n\nThird, the Government’s summation also reflected the core of criminality of transporting\nJane and other underage girls to New York with the intention that sexual activity would occur in\nNew York. In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New\nYork. See Trial Tr. at 289l-92.° The Government’s explanation of Counts One and Three\nfolloued this patern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and\nEpstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.” /d. at 2895. Thus,\nthe Court’s instructions to the jury, the evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s\nargument in summation did not describe “behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment,” Bastian, 77o F.3d at 223 (quoting Danielson, l99 F.3d at 67o), but instead\nconsistently captured the core of criminality with which the Defendant was charged.\n\n2. Thejury note and the Court’s response did not result ina\nconstructive amendment.\n\nThe Defendant contends that regardless of whether the Court’s prior instructions or\nGovernment’s arguments at trial were proper, a jury note revealed that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the\nDefendant for intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, not New York. See\nMaxwell Reply at 2. She argues that the Court then erred by refusing a supplemental instruction.\nThe ambiguous note and the Court’s rejection of the Defendant’s proposed responses to it did not\n5 In its summation regarding Count Two, which introduced the New York predicate offense to the jury, the\nGovernment also repeatedly emphasized that the Defendant and Epstein enticed Jane to travel to New York to be\nabused.

See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, conspiracy to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on the same basis for the conspiracy counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here. In any event, the Defendant’s arguments as to why Counts One and Three were\nconstructively amended are the same.

See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “‘the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,”’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)).

Accordingly, this Court should vacate\nMaxwell’s convictions on Counts Three and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nA. Background Facts\n\nl. The Jury Note\n\nDuring their deliberations, the jury sent a note (the “Jury Note” or the\n“Note’”) inquiring about the proper basis to convict under Count Four of the\nIndictment (the substantive transportation count). The Jury Note read as\nfollous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation\n\nof Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if\n\nthe intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be\n\nfound guilty under the second element?\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021137.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page9o of ll3\nA238\n\nThe second element of Count Four in the Jury Charge to which the jury\nplainly refers requires “that Maxwell knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,”\nnamely, “New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55, sexual abuse in the third\ndegree.” Tr. 3o37:lo-l9\n\nB.

If Maxwell\nwere <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on Counts Three or Four based solely on such conduct, that\nwould be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment.

Hence, the question in the Jury Note.\n\nThus, it was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for\nconviction under Count Four.

Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v.

Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.

The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021238.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N64 3536o38, Page66 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”©? Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided ...

Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Crvil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays.!°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.”!°* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nou As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021313.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel4l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”'’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021321.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NAT 3536o38, Pagel49 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3.

The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021327.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l53 3536o38, Pagel55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2.

FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n7o4 OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021335.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel63 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°”°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021418.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 344 3536o38, Page246 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”3”? Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

July 2oo8: Villafaia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\n<span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.

No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a ‘Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\nao As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021454.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page24 of 2l7\nSA-278\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021476.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page46 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span>, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.**? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nel FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\nad Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021483.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o7 3536o39, Paged3 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o7 of 348\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\na6 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence.

(See Br.79 (citing GX-\n662-R at 44)).

Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely\nseparated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per\nday, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC\nNew York SHU at l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.4 During their shift, they each created and submited falsified\nofficial BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and\nsigned more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 3o-minute rounds (often\n* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. on August 9, 2ol9, folloued by an overtime shift in the\nSHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation.

Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023417.jpg": "Chapter 5: The Events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, and Epstein’s Death\nI. Epstein Signs a New Last Will and Testament on August 8\nIn the weeks follouing Epstein’s death, multiple media outlets reported that Epstein signed a new Last Will\nand Testament on August 8, 2ol9. At least one media organization published a copy of the notarized\ndocument shouing that it was signed by Epstein and two of his atorneys and notarized on August 8, 2ol9.\nAtorney visitor logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York)\nconfirmed that those atorneys and the notary public visited Epstein on that date. The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) confirmed via court records that the August 8, 2ol9 will and other probate-related\ndocuments were filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands on August l5, 2ol9. Among the court filings\nwas an affidavit from another atorney who stated that she received the August 8, 2ol9 will from Epstein.\nThe OIG confirmed via atorney visitor logs that this atorney also visited Epstein at MCC New York on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. The OIG's investigation and review revealed that MCC New York personnel were unaware\nthat Epstein had changed his will 2 days before he died.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she had heard that Epstein had changed his will from media reporting follouing\nhis death. The Chief Psychologist did not knou if the media reporting was accurate, but she thought that if\nit were true, it would have been useful information to knou because it would have been a red flag. The Staff\nPsychologist and the Chief Psychologist told the OIG that if Epstein’s atorneys had notified them or the\nPsychology Department that Epstein had changed his will, such information would have been a factor\nwarranting a review of Epstein’s mental state and Epstein probably would have been placed back on suicide\nwatch or some type of observation.\nIl.

As a result of the court's\norder, that same day approximately 2,ooo pages of documents were released into the public domain, which\ncontained considerable derogatory information about Epstein and some may have related to the criminal\ncharges pending against him.

Cellmate Assignments\n\nDocumentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the\nimportance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes\nconsultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision\nmaking of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members\npresent when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not\naccurately reflect what occurred.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAs was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions\nwere made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff\nmeetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or\nActing Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on\nhousing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate\npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> of a\nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.\nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where\nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with\npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.\nPlease see the atached checklist.\n\n4, Documentation Accuracy\n\nProfessional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted\n\nin your response. Houever, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in\n\ndocumentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.\n\nAs noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be writen within 24 hours of having\n\nthe information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.\nPreconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative\nexplanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.\n\nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for\n\nwriting incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include\n\nan outline of the training and evidence of staff who atended the training.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAdditional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In\naddition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when\nit is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more\nappropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training.

Cellmates are recommended not only for SHU inmates being removed from\nsuicide watch, but also for inmates returning to the general population seting. The C&A officer is responsible for\nentering the proper assignment.\nOnce an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and\nLieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate.\nThe e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with.

Rounds:\nSHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within\nthe policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a\ndaily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly.

All observations must be documented.\nCloser observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre\nbehavior.

The Virgin Islands statute, l4 V.I.C. § l722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to\nregister upon a “person <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> ... on or after July l, l994 of a criminal offense against a i\nminor”. l4 V.I.C. § l722(a) (emphasis added). Under § l722 (c), “a person <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> ... ina ;\nfedcral, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under :\nthis statute,” Failure to register is a crime. l4 VLC. § l722(d), Further, while the Virgin Islands\nregistry is currently acecssible only to law enforcement, there are ongoing discussions about\nopening it to the public.

See, N.Y. Corr.

The wording of :\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at ,\nthe forma] elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child” where the i\nchild is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the child” “with i\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that :\nperson or the child”, CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may '\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been <span class=\"highlight\">convicted</span> in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving j\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare requited to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense.
