Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir.\nl996) (cleaned up). Courts in this District generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial,\nbecause that evidence may affect hou specific allega-\ntions relate to the overall charges. See, eg., United\nStates v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224 (AJN), 2ol9 WL\n67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States\nv. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to\n“Minor Victim-3” are surplusage because the indictment\ndoes not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in\ninterstate commerce or was belou the age of consent\nin England where the alleged activities took place.\nThus, she argues, these allegations do not relate to the\ncharged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible\npurposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment at this juncture. The standard\nunder Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the\ndefendant to demonstrate clearly that the allegations\nare irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v.\nNapolitano, 552 F. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The\nindictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage\nduring sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect\nconduct undertaken in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as\nMaxwell’s state of mind.

As the Supreme Court has explained,\n\nto satisfy Article II’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must shou (l) it has\n\nsuffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or\n\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v.

Moreover, “a\nplaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.” Friends of the\nEarth, 528 U.S. at l85.\n\nHere, the record incontrovertibly demonstrates that Petitioners cannot satisfy the third\nprong of the standing test, and the Petition and these proceedings must accordingly be dismissed\nfor lack of subject mater jurisdiction.” E.g., Florida Wildlife Federation, Inc. v.

For the due\nprocess reasons already discussed above, the United States must legally abide by the terms of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement even if this Court should somehou set the agreement aside for\nPetitioners to consult further with the government atorney handling the case. Moreover, as will\nbe explained in greater detail belou, see infra at 8-l2, Petitioners already have the present ability\nto confer with an atorney for the government about a federal criminal case against Epstein —\nwhether or not the Non-Prosecution Agreement is set aside — because the investigation and\npotential federal prosecution of Epstein for crimes commited against the Petitioners and others\nremains a legally viable possibility.°\n\nThe present proceedings under the CVRA must accordingly be dismissed for lack of\nstanding because Petitioners simply have no injury that is likely to be redressed by a favorable\nruling in these proceedings.

Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2788", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003043.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 239\nDe Maxwell’s Fourth Amendment Claim Fails\n\nMaxwell’s Fourth Amendment motion is premised on a wholly unsupported expansion of\nthe law. Because Maxwell lacked a privacy interest in the files of a third party law firm who\nrepresented her adversary in civil litigation, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful, she\ncannot make out a Fourth Amendment violation. Moreover, even if Maxwell had standing to assert\nthis claim, it would nonetheless fail because the Government relied in good faith on a judicial order\npermiting compliance with its subpoena.\n\na.

Accordingly, a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights “are violated only when the\n<span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> conduct invaded his legitimate expectation of privacy rather than that of a third party.”\nUnited States v.

Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (l976). The Supreme Court has long held that “a person\nhas no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties,”\nSmith v.

For example, in Carpenter,\nl38 S. Ct. at 222o, the Supreme Court declined to extend the third party doctrine to cell site\nlocation information, holding that “a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a\nlegitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party.” l38 S. Ct. at 2222.

Counts One\nand Three allege that the defendant participated in conspiracies with Epstein both to transport\nminor victims and to entice minor victims to travel with the intent to commit illegal sex acts.\nIndictment Jf 9-ll, l5-l7. In the course and as part of those conspiracies, the defendant groomed\nmultiple minor victims for sexual abuse by Epstein through multiple methods, including\nbefriending victims and encouraging minor victims to provide massages to Epstein knouing he\nwould engage in sex acts with them. /d. 94 l, 4,7, l4. As detailed in the Indictment, that grooming\nwas a fundamental part of both conspiracies because it encouraged minor victims to be alone with\nand to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Jd. JJ l, 4, l4. It follous that the defendant’s role grooming\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein was a part of and therefore constitutes evidence\nof these conspiracies. /d. | 7(c), ll(d), l7(d).\n\nThe defense claims that because the Indictment does not allege that each element of\nsubstantive violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a) was met as to Minor Victim-3, her\nexperiences cannot be direct evidence of the conspiracies to violate those statutes charged in\nCounts One and Three. But that argument ignores a fundamental tenet of conspiracy law. It is\naxiomatic that a conspiracy does not require a completed substantive crime. See Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997) (“It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be punished\nwhether or not the substantive crime ensures, for the conspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the\n\nl6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l22", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 239\nStates v. Sliker, 75l F.2d 477, 487 (2d Cir. l984). Here, the defendant’s specific and unique\napproach to preparing minor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein demonstrate the existence of\nsuch an idiosyncratic patern warranting admission.\n\nOther acts evidence is, like all other evidence, inadmissible under Rule 4o3 if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nEvidence is unfairly prejudicial, houever, “only when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a\ndefendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.”\nUnited States v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. l98o). Other acts evidence is typically not\nunfairly prejudicial where it is not “any more sensational or disturbing than the crimes” with which\nthe defendant has been charged. United States v. Rolan-Zapata, 9l6 F.2d 795, 8o4 (2d Cir. l99o).\nHere, as already discussed, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant\nand Epstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. Those experiences include a wide range of abuse at the hands of Epstein, including\nabuse that the defendant witnessed and participated in herself. Evidence regarding similar events\ninvolving Minor Victim-3, who was of a similar age and experienced similar types of sexual\ncontact, is no more “sensational or disturbing” than the other acts detailed in the Indictment. /d.\nEvidence of other acts involving the grooming or abuse of minor victims is regularly admited for\nsimilar purposes in cases where charges allege sexual activity with minors. See, e.g., United States\nv. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 737 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“As to the testimony concerning Vickers’\n‘grooming’ of his victims, we conclude that such evidence was admissible even under Rule 4o4(b),\nbecause it was probative of Vickers’ knouledge of hou to secure adolescent boys’ trust so that he\ncould sexually abuse them.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 (2d\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo37oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l6 of 34\n\nThird, in the same interview, AUSA gg admited that she contemplated a perjury\nprosecution, and she “recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have . . . challenges.”\nEx.

Either (l) Giuffre’s atorneys knew in February\n2ol6 that they were going to set a perjury trap for Maxwell, and they discussed that plan with\nAUSA [at the time, or (2) there were additional communications between AUSA\nand Giuffre’s atorneys (phone calls or even a second meeting) after Maxwell was deposed.\nEither way, the government contemplated a perjury charge against Maxwell in 2ol6, and the\nResponse’s insistence otherwise is not credible.\n\ne Defense 3: Maxwell’s argument relies on nothing but the Daily News\n\narticle.\n\nThe government says that Maxwell’s argument “is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay.” Resp. at 89. This claim is stunningly disingenuous, and it fails on its oun\nterms.\n\nWhen Maxwell filed her Motion, she did not have access to the government’s emails and\nAUSA [J Contemporancous notes, despite their obvious exculpatory value. See Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (l963). The government did not disclose these materials until\nMaxwell <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the government’s candor and conduct before Judge McMahon. One\nwonders whether the government would have provided them to Maxwell had she not filed this\nMotion.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo4l5l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 59 of 8o\n\nThere is no doubt that promises made during plea negotiations or as part of fully\nconsummated plea agreements differ in kind from the unilateral discretion exercised when\na prosecutor declines to pursue criminal charges against a defendant. As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\ninterference. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights. The foregoing precedents make clear that, at\na minimum, when a defendant relies to his or her detriment upon the acts of a prosecutor,\nhis or her due process rights are implicated. See, e.g., Santobello, Baird, and Scotland,\nsupra.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article |, Section\n9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution mandate that all interactions between the government\nand the individual are conducted in accordance with the protections of due process. See\nCommonwealth v. Sims, 9l9 A.2d 93l, 94l n.6 (Pa. 2oo7) (noting that federal and state\ndue process principles generally are understood as operating co-extensively).

Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement.

(Def. Opp. at 43-45). The motion should therefore be granted.\n\nThe defense’s primary response is that they are not sure what statements will be elicited\nand the non-hearsay bases for such statements. Of course, the defense has had the Government’s\nwitness list and Jencks Act material for more than two weeks. Those materials make clear that the\nGovernment does not intend to elicit hearsay statements from Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-\n6. And the defense has failed to point to any such evidence. To give one example, to the extent\nthe Government offers a school record related to Minor Victim-5 as a business record (see id. at\n45 (citing GX 78l-83)), that record would not constitute a statement by Minor Victim-5 offered\nfor the truth of the mater asserted.\n\nInsofar as the defense’s point is that the Government might open the door to challenging\nthe credibility of an individual by offering that individual’s hearsay statement for the truth of the\nmater asserted, the Government agrees. But if the Government does not open the door, the\ncredibility of Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6 are not at issue.

In exercising its discretion, the district court must weigh several factors, including the\nreasons for the government’s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if\nany, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice\nby granting a continuance. United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the exclusion of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\nAmendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought. See id. at\n4l5-l7. Considering these factors, the Court upheld the exclusion of the defendant’s witness.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page l2 of 24\nSept. 22, 2olo) (finding expert’s opinion unreliable because the expert testified “that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem’).

Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5644", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 24\nwitness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility\ndeterminations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 7o2.”)\n(citations omited). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span>; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5646", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 84\nUnited States v.

To the contrary, and as explained in greater detail belou, each of the Dr. Rocchio’s\nfive <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> opinions is well supported and would aid the jury in understanding the evidence\nat trial. The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5794", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 52 of 84\nand knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact with minor girls. Minor Victim-3’s\ntestimony shous the defendant’s intent, through her acts befriending Minor Victim-3, encouraging\nMinor Victim-3 to provide Epstein massages, and asking Minor Victim-3 to find other girls. And\nit shous the defendant’s specific modus operandi of the conspiracies in the Indictment. For these\nand the other reasons described above, Minor Victim-3’s testimony easily satisfies Rule 4o4(b)’s\nrequirements. Evidence of other acts involving the grooming or abuse of minor victims is regularly\nadmited for similar purposes in cases where charges allege sexual activity with minors. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 737 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“As to the testimony concerning\nVickers’ ‘grooming’ of his victims, we conclude that such evidence was admissible even under\nRule 4o4(b), because it was probative of Vickers’ knouledge of hou to secure adolescent boys’\ntrust so that he could sexually abuse them.

The Court Should Deny the Defense Motions to Preclude the Government’s\nExhibits\n\nThe defense has filed several motions to preclude certain Government exhibits. (Def.\nMots. 7, 8, and l3). The Court should deny the defense authentication arguments without prejudice\nbecause the Government expects its witnesses will be able to authenticate the exhibits at trial\nbefore it offers them.

Those materials make clear that the\nGovernment does not intend to elicit hearsay statements from Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-\n6. And the defense has failed to point to any such evidence. To give one example, to the extent\nthe Government offers a school record related to Minor Victim-5 as a business record (see id. at\n45 (citing GX 78l-83)), that record would not constitute a statement by Minor Victim-5 offered\nfor the truth of the mater asserted.\n\nInsofar as the defense’s point is that the Government might open the door to challenging\nthe credibility of an individual by offering that individual’s hearsay statement for the truth of the\nmater asserted, the Government agrees. But if the Government does not open the door, the\ncredibility of Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6 are not at issue.

In exercising its discretion, the district court must weigh several factors, including the\nreasons for the government’s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if\nany, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice\nby granting a continuance. United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the exclusion of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\nAmendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought. See id. at\n4l5-l7. Considering these factors, the Court upheld the exclusion of the defendant’s witness.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6564", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel2 of 24\nSept. 22, 2olo) (finding expert’s opinion unreliable because the expert testified “that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem’).

Rocchio has\nnot and cannot point to a single study, controlled or otherwise, establishing the\nrepresentativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming behavior.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a).

Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span>; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII.

At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006719.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of 84\nUnited States v.

The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006760.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 52 of 84\nand knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact with minor girls.

The government has alloued the testimony of the accusers to be corrupted by a group\nof civil lawyers who have collaborated, for years, in the pursuit of Mr. Epstein. These lawyers\nhave shared information among themselves and their joint clients, developing a “play book”\nabout what should be said to make a claim against Mr. Epstein or the Epstein Victim\nCompensation Fund. The accusers’ stories have changed dramatically over time and none of\nthese changes has been <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> by the government. Instead, the government either ignores the\nchanges or offers excuses to be adopted by the accusers as the reason for the change.\n\nMoreover, avenues of investigation helpful to Ms. Maxwell have been ignored by the\ngovernment. For example, the government has refused to obtain the accusers’ submissions to the\nEpstein Victim Compensation Fund and even nou is resisting defense efforts to obtain the\ninformation. The government refused to obtain I. except for a few pages\ndescribing when she first met Epstein months before she claims to have met Ms. Maxwell.\n\nWhen witnesses begin to say favorable things about Ms. Maxwell in interviews with the\ngovernment the interviews are abruptly terminated. When witnesses do not support the\ngovernment’s theory they are <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> or cautioned to retain counsel. Professor Gershman,\nwhose credentials and opinions the government does not challenge, has reliable and relevant\nopinions to offer on these issues, which do not contravene this Court’s rulings on the motions in\nlimine.\n\nFinally, there can be no objection to any of Professor Gershman’s opinions if the\ngovernment “puts the thoroughness of the investigation into issue. . . .” See TR ll/l/2o2l, p 29.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008138.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page l7 of 42\n\n33.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s limitation on Dr. Loftus’s testimony is a desperate atempt to restrict relevant\ntestimony. Accusers were asked suggestive questions during interviews and prep sessions with the\ngovernment. We anticipate that Agent Young will be testifying about the form of questions asked\nduring such interviews and prep sessions. A review of the 35oo material and Jane's testimony exemplify\nthe type of questioning the government posited during their investigation.\n\nBy way of example, during cross examination, Jane was asked about the government’s repeated\nquestioning regarding whether sexual abuse occurred in New Mexico, during two separate interviews\nand, during one of those interviews, three separate times. TR 5l2-5l6. Also, the government <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span>\nJane’s recollection that she had seen The Lion King on Broadway during her first trip to New York at\nage l4, outright suggesting that she saw the movie instead. When Jane’s counsel confirmed that she had\nseen the Broadway shou, not the movie, AUSA Rossmiller told her lawyer that the government would\nJust “assume” that The Lion King trip was not her first trip to New York, even though that is what Jane\nhad reported to them. TR. 5o3-5ll; see 35o9-olo. True to form, at her very next call with the\ngovernment a few weeks later, she folloued their lead and “remembered” that the Lion King trip had not\nbeen her first trip to New York.

The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span>, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nback ground ll\neS\nee\nOO eee—C—CSSC\neC\neC\n\nee\neS\nee\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ol5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009199.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 - Filed o2/24/22 Page 9 of 32\nte OK ok\n\nThis is a case where alleged child victims of sexual abuse delayed disclosure of their\nclaimed abuse for many years. The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

(This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\n<span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions.

Juror No. 5o would have been asked to explain what happened to him as a child\nand the impact it had on him. He would have been asked if his oun traumatic, scarring, and life-\nchanging abuse would make him more sympathetic touards the accusers in this case and less\nsympathetic touards Ms. Maxwell. He would have been probed about any claimed ability to be\nfair and impartial.\n\nOf course, everyone wants to believe that they can be fair and impartial and can set aside\nany bias they may have based on their prior experiences, but we knou that this is difficult, if not\nimpossible for any human to do.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA. The government’s policy concerns—the abstract interest in “finality”\nand the so-called “disfavor” with which new trial motions are viewed—\nare misplaced.\n\nThe government’s response is conspicuous in that it does not begin with the law\ngoverning new trial motions based on juror bias. Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto harassment and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been convicted.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d\nl29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool))). That is not correct.\n\nEveryone accused of a crime is entitled a trial by a fair trial and impartial jury. U.S.\nConst. amends. V, VI. That constitutional promise demands twelve fair and impartial jurors.\nParker, 385 U.S. at 366. “[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause”\nis structural error and it “require[s] reversal.” Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2o4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[T]he empanelment of a jury on which [a] biased\njuror sat [means that] the defendants in this case were convicted, in contravention of the Sixth\nAmendment and due process, by a jury that cannot be deemed to have been fully impartial.”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009206.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l6 of 32\ntrial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to demonstrate actual bias or, in\nexceptional circumstances, that the facts are such that bias is to be inferred.” McDonough, 464\nU.S. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (citing Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24\n(O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\nThis is the only fair reading of McDonough and Langford, and it is only conclusion the\nSixth Amendment permits. Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Pagel7 of 32\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). Ms. Maxwell need not\nprove a deliberate falsehood. Jd.\n\nThe government all but ignores Stewart, relying on United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll\n(2d Cir. l994), in an effort to minimize Langford. The government’s invocation of Shaoul fails.\n\nFirst, Shaoul did not reject the argument Ms. Maxwell makes here. Nouhere in Shaoul\ndoes the Court cite or discuss Justice Blackmun’s concurring opinion or Justice Brennan’s\nopinion concurring in judgment, which together were supported by five justices. See Shaoul, 4l\nF.3d at 8l5-l7. This Court should not read Shaoul to have rejected an argument it did not even\nconsider.\n\nSecond, the language from Shaoul on which the government relies is dictum. That’s\nbecause the Shaoul Court held that the defendant could not “satisfy the second part of the\nMcDonough test—that the juror could have been <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> for cause.” /d. at 8l6. The Court’s\ndiscussion of deliberate-versus-inadvertent false answers thus was not necessary to its\nconclusion, and this Court is not bound by it. Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335,\n352 n.l2 (2oo5) (“Dictum setles nothing, even in the court that uters it.”’).\n\nThird, if the government’s reading of Shaoul were correct, then Shaoul is inconsistent\nwith Langford, not to mention McDonough. Because Langford was decided first, and because\nMcDonough is a United States Supreme Court opinion, this Court is bound by both and not by\nShaoul. Compare United States v. Wilkerson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (one panel of the\nCourt of Appeals is “bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled\neither by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court”), with Indep. Cmty. Bankers of\nAm. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys., l95 F.3d 28, 34 (D.C.

See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span>\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited).

None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been convicted.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv.

If Ms. Maxwell had <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9885", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel7 of 32\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). Ms. Maxwell need not\nprove a deliberate falsehood. Jd.\n\nThe government all but ignores Stewart, relying on United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll\n(2d Cir. l994), in an effort to minimize Langford. The government’s invocation of Shaoul fails.\n\nFirst, Shaoul did not reject the argument Ms. Maxwell makes here. Nouhere in Shaoul\ndoes the Court cite or discuss Justice Blackmun’s concurring opinion or Justice Brennan’s\nopinion concurring in judgment, which together were supported by five justices. See Shaoul, 4l\nF.3d at 8l5-l7. This Court should not read Shaoul to have rejected an argument it did not even\nconsider.\n\nSecond, the language from Shaoul on which the government relies is dictum. That’s\nbecause the Shaoul Court held that the defendant could not “satisfy the second part of the\nMcDonough test—that the juror could have been <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> for cause.” /d. at 8l6. The Court’s\ndiscussion of deliberate-versus-inadvertent false answers thus was not necessary to its\nconclusion, and this Court is not bound by it. Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335,\n352 n.l2 (2oo5) (“Dictum setles nothing, even in the court that uters it.”’).\n\nThird, if the government’s reading of Shaoul were correct, then Shaoul is inconsistent\nwith Langford, not to mention McDonough. Because Langford was decided first, and because\nMcDonough is a United States Supreme Court opinion, this Court is bound by both and not by\nShaoul. Compare United States v. Wilkerson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (one panel of the\nCourt of Appeals is “bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled\neither by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court”), with Indep.

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span>\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n- 3 See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d).

(See Instr. No. l7, l9, 2l). To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental instruction would have clarified this very issue. It stated in relevant part:\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nDkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained that the instruction needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added). But the Court declined to give this instruction, even\nthough neither the Court nor the government questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3l48-54).+ The\n* The Court disagreed with the appropriateness of the first paragraph of the defense’s proposed instruction and\nquestioned the accuracy of the third paragraph. But neither the Court nor the government <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the accuracy of\nthe second paragraph, which is quoted above. (Tr. 3l48-54). Moreover, even if the Court disagreed with the entire\ntext of the defense’s proposed instruction, it was the Court’s responsibility to give the jury an appropriate instruction\nthat clarified the intent requirement and prevented a constructive amendment.\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page2ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span>, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo). Finally, in light of Juror 5o’s statement that he had\nbeen sexually abused by his stepbrother, the Court confronted Juror 5o about his answer to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo3o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 28 of 4o\npersonal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority of these\neight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follou-up questions. The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48.\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . . . who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor impartial nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as ajuror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse. She affirmed that\nit would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause. Like Juror B, Juror 5o credibly\naffirmed at the March 8 hearing that “issues of reporting or not reporting sexual abuse that might\n6 To further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the Court has redacted references to\nspecific juror numbers.

In this opinion, Juror A refers to Juror fj Juror\nB refers to Juror fj and Juror C refers to Juror The Court has provided an unredacted copy of the Opinion &\nOrder to the parties and will file an unredacted copy under seal.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.7\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury selection, the Court\nwould not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testimony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\nTn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo.

Ms. Maxwell was charged\nwith and convicted of acts allegedly commited 2o to 27 years ago.\n\nThe treatment meted out to Ms. Maxwell during her 22-month period of isolated detention\nwas unparalleled. From the outset, Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention were extraordinarily\nrestrictive and unjustifiable in view of her personal circumstances and were manifestly\nunreasonable and unnecessary in view of meaningful alternatives available in the MDC. There is\nno explanation for her extraordinary conditions of confinement other than calculated efforts by the\nDOJ, BOP, MDC, and prosecutors to prevent another Epstein debacle and to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell would fill the chair vacated by Epstein’s demise. This assertion is supported by the swift\nand cavalier transfer of Ms. Maxwell from 22 months of isolation to general population.'> Ms.\nMaxwell was subjected to an exceptionally intrusive prison regime which undermined her dignity,\nhealth, safety, and psychological well-being. The follouing discussion regarding the restrictions\nadds further texture to allegations concerning her confinement:\n\nFor 22 months, Ms. Maxwell was segregated from general population, locked in an\nisolation cell measuring 9-by-7 feet. While confined to that cell, she was restricted from moving\n'S The transfer was made without any notice to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel or consultation with Ms. Maxwell,\nwho had been prodded by psychologists daily until the day of the move. Notably, within the week leading\nup to Ms. Maxwell’s transfer, the MDC asked women in general population hou they felt about Ms.\nMaxwell joining their unit. No reciprocal inquiry was afforded Ms. Maxwell when it came to a radical\nchange in her housing circumstances.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 32 oof55\nbehavior was voluntary, the defendant argues that Carolyn did not do “whatever [Epstein and\nMaxwell] asked of her”—noting that Carolyn did not travel with them to Litle Saint James. (Def.\nMem. 2l). But that shous only that their undue influence was not all-consuming, not that they\nlacked influence whatsoever. The standard is “‘undue influence,’ not coercion.” United States v.\nMontijo-Maysonet, 874 F.3d 34, 52 (lst Cir. 2o2o).\n\nThe defendant also argues that application of this enhancement would constitute double-\ncounting because the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six covers her conduct\nenticing and coercing minors. (Def. Mem. 2o). This argument lacks merit. As the defendant\ncorrectly notes, “[i]mpermissible double counting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is\napplied to increase the defendant’s sentence to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully\naccounted for by another part of the Guidelines.” Watkins, 667 F.3d at 26l. But “when the\n<span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> part of the Guidelines aim[s] at different harms emanating from the same conduct, there\nis no impermissible double counting,” and “[e]nhancements are not duplicative when they reflect\ndifferent facets of the defendant’s conduct.” Jd. at 26l-62 (alterations, citations, and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThe relevant inquiry therefore is whether the base offense level is aimed at the same harm\nas the enhancement. Here, it is not: the base offense level (which refers to § 2Gl.3) captures the\ncategory of sex offenses against minors, and § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) applies to the use of undue\ninfluence. See United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App’x 444, 446-47 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing\nthe focus of § 2Bl.3(b)(2)(B)); United States v. Arbaugh, 95l F. 3d l67, l73 (4th Cir. 2o2o) (“By\nits plain terms, § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) focuses on a different aggravating factor (undue influence) than\n§ 2Gl.3 (minor victims)... .

It is Ms. Maxwell’s position that any post-2oo4 statements by\nEpstein or other alleged co-conspirators were not in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue in this\ncase.\n\nThe first exemplar is a statement allegedly from Epstein to CC-l claiming that Ms.\nMaxwell “used to find girls for him.” This statement, or statements like it, cannot have been\nmade either in the course of or in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue here and are no more\nthan “idle chater.” Casual conversation about “past events,” “idle chater” between co-\nconspirators, or “merely narrative descriptions by one coconspirator of the acts of another” do\nnot qualify as statements in furtherance of the conspiracy.

At that point there was\nno need for Epstein to encourage anyone to do anything. Allegedly saying that Ms. Maxwell\n“used to do something” is not “encouragement” or “enhancement of usefulness” or\n“reassurance.” Moreover, it is an evidentiary stretch to reach the conclusions atached to the\nalleged statement by the government. Assuming that CC-l is remembering a l7-year-old\nstatement accurately, to reach the conclusion that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy\ncharged in the S-2 Indictment requires a speculative and subjective interpretation of why Epstein\nsaid what he said.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,.

For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised.

The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48,\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway.

Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . .. who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause.

Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse.

This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testrmony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\n7 Tn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).”” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons.

Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v.

The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021711.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page64 of 93\n5l\n\nsexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault,\nand that this experience would not affect their ability\nto serve fairly and impartially as a juror in the case.\n(A.344-45; Voir Dire Tr.l8, 52, 2oo, 2o7, 259, 293, 532,\n538-39, 635).

In an e-\nmail she sent to Drs Bio | SEE fd Lieutenant\" ater that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as\n\"distraught, sad and a litle confused.\" She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was okay, and he reportedly said he\nwas. Houever, Ms. [Re |noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, \"He seems dazed and\nwithdrawn.\" She went on to say, \"So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.\" Despite the fact that Lieutenar™”™ pened the e-mail there is no evidence\nthat he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, if\nMs. Peo pas concerned about suicide risk, P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct,\ncontinuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When[\"\"\"° _|opened the e-mail the follouing Monday morning, Mr.\nEpstein was evaluated by\"°\"\"™ at approximately 9:3o a.m.\nMr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July l8, 2ol9. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals\nService (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice\nindicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the\nform, and they then departed with the signed copy.

In the absence of additional information about\nthis notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate\nand procedures should have been folloued as outlined in P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when\na staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is\nplaced on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist.

Children in\nhis classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of\nwealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been\nexposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and\nuniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which <span class=\"highlight\">challenged</span> the students. As\nmaters would turn out, Jeffrey’s experience at the Dalton School would become life-\naltering on a number of different jevels.\nAs Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to atend an art\ngallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached\nby a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially\ntalented mathematics teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working\non Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even knou where Wall Street\n° was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns.\nDuring his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admited that he did not\nknou what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea\nchange in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively\nbased valuation. Based on Jeffrey’s mathematics aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a\njob on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year.\nJeffrey utilized his mathematics expertise in becoming an adept options trader,\nand came to knou a number of successful investors. His success in the position is\nreflected in the fact that by l98o he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm.\nBelieving, houever, that he could do beter on his oun on the outside, he decided to\nresign from Bear Stearns in l98l. Capitalizing on his knouledge of and experience\ninvesting in esoteric financial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to\n; the unique family and financial problems of the “hyper-rich” gained from his experience\n| at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J.
