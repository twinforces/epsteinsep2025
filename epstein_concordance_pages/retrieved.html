Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nGhislaine Maxwell requests that the Court issue an order requiring delivery of her legal mail\nwithin one business day of receipt by the post office. (See Dkt. 35o.) The problems encountered by\nlegal mail delays continue. I have atempted to address this with MDC Legal via email (but at times\nreceive no response) and have conferred with government counsel. Only after two emails were sent\ntoday, the later informing MDC Legal that failure to respond would result in the filing of an order to\nshou cause, did I receive a response: “There was mail picked up today,” but no indication when Ms.\nMaxwell will receive the mail.\n\nLegal mail sent by counsel through the United States Postal Service for “next day delivery”\nremains at the post office for pick up by the MDC. The mail is not picked up daily, as evidenced by\ntracking information (most recently obtained this morning) and often remains at the Post Office for days\nbefore <span class=\"highlight\">retrieved</span> by the MDC. (See Exhibit A.) The Court invited the defense to bring this issue to the\nCourt’s atention if Ms. Maxwell does not receive mail within one business day of receipt. We are\nrequesting that the Court direct the MDC to retrieve the mail within one business day of receipt by the\npost office so that legal mail sent “next day delivery” does not languish in the post office for days on\nend. The government suggests this may be due to resource issues at the MDC and reminds us that Ms.\nMaxwell’s mail is handled the same as that of other inmates. But unlike other inmates, Ms. Maxwell is\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo545l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Nonetheless, the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">retrieved</span> some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023437.jpg": "because he did not conduct any rounds within the SHU on August 9 and he did not recall signing the form.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant confirmed that she conducted her round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said she went up to the\nlo South Unit and then back doun to the SHU because she needed to sign the round sheets. Contrary to\nBOP training for new Lieutenants, which she atended in 2oll, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\ntold the OIG, “We are not required to go to each individual cell and look at the inmates.

Discovery of Epstein Hanged in Cell and Emergency Response\nOn August lo, 2ol9, shortly after 6 a.m., the doorbell to the SHU rang, indicating that a delivery of breakfast\ncarts had arrived at the SHU. Noel and Thomas <span class=\"highlight\">retrieved</span> the breakfast carts from the double-locked\nentrance to the SHU and brought them inside the SHU. At the time, Thomas and Noel were the only officers\nin the SHU. At approximately 6:3o a.m., MCC New York security camera video recordings shou Noel and\nThomas walking touard the L Tier. Noel and Thomas told the OIG that at this time they were entering the\nL Tier, in which Epstein was housed, to deliver breakfast to the inmates. As discussed previously, between\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, the OIG did not observe\non the available recorded video any COs or other individuals approach the L Tier where Epstein was housed\nfrom the common area of the SHU.\nNoel told the OIG that she unlocked the door to the L Tier so Thomas could deliver the breakfast trays.\nThomas told the OIG that he knocked on Epstein’s cell door, saw a portion of Epstein through the windou\nbut could not make out what he saw, so he said to Epstein, “Come to the door, come to the door.” Thomas\nsaid he did not observe any movement or hear a response, so he unlocked the cell door, entered the cell,\nand saw Epstein hanged as described further belou. Thomas said he immediately yelled for Noel to get\nhelp, and that Noel activated a body alarm, signaling a medical emergency, and began taking the steps\ndescribed belou.\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023443.jpg": "According to a memorandum atached to the Form 583 from the Correctional Systems Officer dated\nAugust lo, 2ol9, after Noel called the medical emergency, the Correctional Systems Officer received a call\nfrom staff in the SHU instructing her to call 9ll for an ambulance. The Correctional Systems Officer notified\nthe New York Police Department (NYPD) via the MCC New York institutional NYPD telephone. The\nCorrectional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance and medical\nassistance for one of the inmates. The New York City Fire Department and EMS arrived at MCC New York at\n6:43 a.m. and were escorted to the second-floor medical area. EMS departed MCC New York with Epstein\nand a BOP escort via ambulance and chase car to the local hospital at 7:lo a.m.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was relieved as the Operations Lieutenant\nprior to 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, but was still working on things like the Daily Activity Reports and\nLieutenant Logs that she did not get to finish during her shift. At some point, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant heard that there was a medical emergency in SHU, so she went to assist because she\nknew that inmates would need to be given food and other things would need to be done. The Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant estimated that she went to the SHU around 7 a.m. to help with the inmate\nmeals, and believed the Electronics Technician was also helping out. Noel was there, but she was not\nhelping with delivering food to the inmates. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that after the\nmeals were delivered, she finished up and went home.\nAll MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any\ninformation suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Additionally, no\ninmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his oun life\nor had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\nSome MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other\nthings, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had\nbeen conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,\nwhich resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired\nduring their shifts. Other MCC New York staff members told the OIG that even if inmate safety and\naccountability measures had been property executed, an inmate who wanted to take his life would have\nfound a way to do so.\nB. Items Found in Epstein’s Cell on August lo Follouing His Death\nFollouing Epstein’s death, the BOP and FBI collected many of the items found inside Epstein’s cell. The FBI\ninspected the cell and <span class=\"highlight\">retrieved</span> what it believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player. The FBI did not recover\nany weapons inside of the cell. After the FBI's inspection, the BOP recycled the linens from Epstein’s cell and\ncollected the remaining items, which included various over-the-counter medications, books (including\nreligious books), BOP pamphlets, toiletries, bateries, headphones, glasses, mail and envelopes, a broun\npaper bag, an orange homemade rope, AED pads, and a medical device.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23443\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023448.jpg": "Chapter 6: The Availability of Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nDue to the Security Camera Recording System Failure\nIn August 2ol9, the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York) had\napproximately l5o video security cameras (no audio) placed throughout the institution. The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) found that approximately ll cameras were located in and around the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August lo, 2ol9, including one at\nthe end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that shoued any movement in or out of inmate cells and in\nthe Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live\nvideo feeds. Follouing Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\ninvestigators atempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the\nsecurity cameras were working and transmiting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the\nSHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29,\n2ol9, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier. As a result, while the L Tier video camera\nwas transmiting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of August lo, 2ol9, the video\nwas not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and lo was a\ncamera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of\nthe common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to\nthe different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or atempting to enter the L Tier from\nthe common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and lo, would have been picked up by the video\nrecorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings shoued the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU\nstaff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from\nEpstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.\n|. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York\nAll video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR)\nsystem. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR l” and “DVR 2,” and each\nconsisted of l6 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York's security\ncameras were assigned to record to DVR l, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras\nassigned to DVR l only recorded to the DVR l hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to\nthe DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be\n<span class=\"highlight\">retrieved</span> from DVR l, and vice versa.\nThe OIG's investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2ol9, the\nElectronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the\nOIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2ol6, he found that the facility's security camera system\nneeded to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly\nmaintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be\nreplaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023460.jpg": "The FBI's Digital Forensics Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia, received MCC New York's DVR system on\nAugust l6, 2ol9, and began to conduct a forensic analysis of the system. According to FBI forensic reports,\nDVR 2 did not start successfully. The Digital Forensics Analysis Unit found that the system contained three\nfaulty hard drives. The FBI forensic reports state that the three drives were repaired by an FBI Advanced\nData Recovery Specialist, but the DVR was never able to be assembled successfully. The forensic reports\nfurther state that an FBI computer scientist and the Company l Technician reviewed the DVR 2 controller\nlogs and found that there had previously been “catastrophic disk failures” and no recordings would have\nbeen available after July 29, 2ol9.\nWhen the OIG asked the Electronics Technician about this finding by the FBI, he told the OIG he was\nunaware that cameras were not recording to DVR 2 between July 29 and August 8, 2ol9. Neither the\nWarden nor the SIS Lieutenant was aware the cameras assigned to DVR 2 had not been recording since\nJuly 29, 2ol9. The Company l Technician could not recall working with the Electronics Technician on any\nDVR issues prior to August 8, 2ol9, but he said that if the entire DVR 2 server went doun on July 29, 2ol9, no\nvideo would have been able to have been <span class=\"highlight\">retrieved</span> from that point forward from any of the cameras\nrecording to DVR 2.\n\n93\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026915.jpg": "Page 3326\nMENTORS ;\niy U.S. Department of Justice\ncs Federal Bureau of Prisons\nae i SA . .\nSee Psychological Services\nnn\nMetropolitan Correctional Center |\nl5o Park Raw\nNew York, New York looo7\n(646) 836-63oo, (646) 836-775l (Fax)\nBs\nlo\n7\nTo: Le [2\\o Operations Lt.

Epstein\ncontinued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his touel and paid CL $2oo.oo\nfor the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could\nhappen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where\n\n_ she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for\nCL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who\nprepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a touel. Epstein had CL remove her\nclothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his\nback. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and\ndounward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the\nother hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the touel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid\n$2oo.oo for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would\nhappen. CL wanted to notify authorities houever she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her\nfamily.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim\nthrough information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books <span class=\"highlight\">retrieved</span>\nfrom the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age\neighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same\nmassage routine when they went to “work” for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and\nmade appointments for the females to “work” for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein’s house and were\nled upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein’s bedroom. Epstein would then\nenter the room wearing only a touel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the\nmassage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed State of Florida\nbefore me this l day of May, 2oo6 by County of Palm Beach\nDet Joe Recarey, who is personally knoun to me. \\ (|\n\nwax |\nLZ Pde ZZ 4 Signatur ie esting Officer\nSignature of Police‘Officer (F.S.S. ll7.lo) Date: o57ol/2oo6\no7/26/l7 Paggopt 22 l2o Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o7o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00031007.jpg": "Js = viewing Case Number o6o49528 Page 3 of 3\nPALM BEACH COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE\nCASE NO. o6o49528 OFFENSE REPORT CASE NO,\nDISPOSITION: CLEARED BY\nTHEN FLED THE RESIDENCE ON FOOT TO THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE IN ORDER\nTO USE THE PHONE. - -.. <span class=\"highlight\">RETRIEVED</span> |.

But Goldberger said in a prepared\n\n| statement that \"the reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were\nnot charged because the Palm Beach County state atorney's office questioned the\n\n| credibility of the witnesses.\"\nThe statement also said that \"a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly\nunsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr.\nEpstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute.\"\nGoldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph\nexaminer, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage. Moreover, the police\nsearch of Epstein's home turned up no evidence to support the girls' allegations,\nGoldberger said.\nSolicitation of a prostitute is typically a misdemeanor. Epstein was indicted on a third-\ndegree felony solicitation charge applied when there are three or more alleged offenses,\nAfter completing its investigation, Palm Deach police turned the cause over to uisenci’s\noffice several months ago with a probable cause affidavit stating that Epstein should be\navrested on four counts of unlawful sex. acts with 2 vamoerand onc Countul a. aA\nlascivious molestation, all second-degree felonics.\nJanet Kinsella, spokeswoman for Palm Beach police, said the departineit handed the case\nto Krischer only because Epstein was not at his Palm Beach residence.\n\"The normal procedure when you want to arrest a person in another state is to file for an\narrest warrant with the State Atorney's Office, which we did,” Kinsella said.\nBut rather than arresting Epstein on those charges, Krischer's office took the case before\nthe grand jury.\nPolice Chief Michael Reiter was so upset with Krischer's handling of the case that he\nsuggested in a May l memo that Krischer disqualify himself from the case.
