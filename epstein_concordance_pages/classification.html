Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious <span class=\"highlight\">classification</span>.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\n<span class=\"highlight\">classification</span> and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000285.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l2 of l6\nsignificantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory\n<span class=\"highlight\">classification</span>. Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest <span class=\"highlight\">classification</span> available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v.

It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000329.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB_ = Documentil Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lofl4\n.)

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defendant’s Motion for\nPretrial Release (the “Release Motion’), dated July ll, 2ol9 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (the “Detention Memo”), submited to Magistrate Judge\nPitman on July 8, 2ol9, which is atached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that <span class=\"highlight\">classification</span> louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\n<span class=\"highlight\">classification</span> level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000433.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 22 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page3of9\nHon.

It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process.

This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this.

These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation.

Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for commiting suicide,\nBOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.\nBOP policy (Program Statement 5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all\nnew inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. Houever, at MCCs, among other facilities\nwith high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by\nPsychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or\nappear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting\nsigns of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who\nare placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of commiting suicide and\nshould therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy\nexplicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has\nreason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,\ncontinuous observation.”\nEvery BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, dedicated to\ninmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For\ninmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous observation of\nthe inmate believed to be at risk of commiting suicide. Follouing suicide watch and based on clinical\nfindings follouing a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to\na medical referral or health care facility. Psychological observation is a less restrictive form of individual\nmonitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general\npopulation or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide\nwatch goun and will be alloued a suicide watch blanket.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch\nwhen the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological observation is a louer <span class=\"highlight\">classification</span>, witnesses told the\nOIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that\ninmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023384.jpg": "Disk failures occur in DVR 2 of MCC New York's security camera system,\n\nwhich results in the system being unable to record, although the cameras\n\ncontinue to work and broadcast live video feed.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nIl. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, <span class=\"highlight\">classification</span>, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York.

BOP’s Special Investigative Services (SIS) opened an\ninvestigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether Epstein harmed himself or had\nbeen assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, at approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Houever, Epstein\nremained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation\nuntil July 3o, 2ol9.4\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the\ninmate is believed to be imminently suicidal.

At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who\ngoes on and off suicide watch. The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes\nrecommendations to the institution’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of\nsuicide watch. According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off\nof suicide watch be housed with other inmates; houever, she said the recommendations cannot always be\ncarried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends\nconducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.\nThe Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide\nPrevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive\nstaff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief\nPsychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be\nhoused with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.\nAccording to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted\ndisciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was\ninsufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically\nevaluated on July 3o, 2ol9, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember\nhou he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2ol9, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2ol9,\nincident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself\nor that he had been harmed by his cellmate.\n74 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9.\n5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.\n\n3l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023400.jpg": "common practice in the BOP for prisoners coming off of suicide watch to be assigned a cellmate.

MCC New York Psychology Department personnel told the OIG\nthat MCC New York staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement because it was discussed during\nstaff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and during required\nstaff training.\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l said she explained to the\natorney that Epstein needed to have a cellmate because he was housed in the SHU and he was a\nsex offender.\nVI. Selection of Epstein’s Cellmate After Psychological Observation\nThe Captain told the OIG that he compiled a list of possible cellmates for Epstein, veted those inmates, and\nprovided the list of names to the MCC New York Warden. The Warden told the OIG that he identified two\npotential cellmates and tentatively decided on Inmate 3. The Warden said he passed this information on to\nthe BOP Director's Chief of Staff and later received word that he should assign Inmate 3 to be\nEpstein’s cellmate.\nThe Warden told the OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to replace Inmate 3 if he left MCC New York. The\nWarden and the Captain told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would\nhave had to review a new list of potential cell mate candidates to ensure that Epstein was housed with an\nappropriate inmate. According to the Warden and the Captain, if Inmate 3 was no longer detained at MCC\nNew York, SHU staff should have informed a Lieutenant on duty, who should have informed the Captain,\nwho would have ensured that the process of selecting a new cellmate for Epstein would begin.\nVil. Epstein’s Cell Assignment from July 3o to August lo\nAs a result of Epstein’s cellmate requirement, on July 3o, 2ol9, follouing his release from psychological\nobservation, Epstein was initially assigned to cell Zo4-2o6 with Inmate 3 in the J Tier of the SHU.2° A BOP\n26 SENTRY, which is BOP’s database of information relating to the care, <span class=\"highlight\">classification</span>, subsistence, protection, discipline,\nand programs of inmates, inaccurately reflected that this move from his psychological observation cell to the SHU\noccurred the previous day (July 29, 2ol9).

If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY\nALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be\nnotified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to\nscreen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other\npertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.\nInmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.\nPsychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,\nbut will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex\noffense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\nscheduled to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there\nis no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk\nassessment by a psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant, On-Call Psychologist and Warden will be notified.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l2l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025142.jpg": "Page 826\n=~ —\nBP-Ao3o8 ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION ORDER U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nJAN l7 .\nFEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n———S = Se ee ee SS ee\nNEWYORK MCC\nInstitution\nDate/Time; o7-lo-2ol9\nTO: Special Hansino Unit Office\nDB) (BT HC)\nSUBJECT : Placement of EPSTEIN, JEFFERY .Reg.No.___7-lo-2ol9 _ in Administrative Detention\n(a) |s pending an investigation for a violation of Bureau regulations;\n(b) Is pending an SIS investigation.\n(c) Is pending investigation or trial for a criminal act;\n(d) Is tobe admited to Administrative Detention\n(l) Since the inmate has requested admission for protection;\n| hereby request placementin Administrative Detention for my oun protection.\nInmate Signature/Register No;\nStaff Witness Printed NameSignature;\n(2) Since a serious threat exists to individual's safety as perceived by staff, although person has not requested admission; referral of\nthe necessary information will be forwarded for an appropriate hearing by the SRO.\n(e) Is pending transfer or is in holdover status during transfer.\n¥__(f) _ Is pending <span class=\"highlight\">classification</span>; or\n(g) Is terminating confinement in Disciplinary Segregation and has been ordered into Administrative Detention by the Warden's\ndesignee.\nIt is this Correctional Supervisor's decision based on all the circumstances that the above named inmate's continued presence in the general\npopulation poses a serious threat to life, property, self, staff, other inmates, orto the security or orderly running of the institution because*\nPENDING <span class=\"highlight\">CLASSIFICATION</span>\nTherefore, the above named inmate is to be placed in Administrative Detention until further notice.
