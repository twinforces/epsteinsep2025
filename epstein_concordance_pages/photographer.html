A woman\nl3 introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be\n\nl4 extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would\nl5 probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away.\nl6 The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey\nl7 Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we\n\nl8 chated very briefly. I had my portfolio of photos, but he\n\nl9 didn't even look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got\n2o close to me. I got up to leave, but the door was locked.\n2l I didn't knou what was going on. It was my first\n22 official meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a\n23 young girl and confused. He got very close to me, and I had a\n24 skirt on. He started to touch my genitals. I refused him.\n25 Then he went to the massage table and shoued me the vibrator.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002024.jpg": "Leter in Support of Ghislaine Maxwell Cont/...\nAs far as allouing my oun young children and or their friends to visit , both before and at any\ntime in the future, the answer is an unequivocal YES.
