Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a <span class=\"highlight\">journalist</span> for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nIn 2ol7 | lived with Ghislaine and her familv for a few weeks. helping move them into their house. Ke\n\nee\n\nIt is very obvious that they love her\ndeeply. They are an incredibly strong and close family unit.\nGhislaine has lived in the United States since the beginning of the l99os and has had to deal with\nfluctuating amounts of press interest in her life. This was notwithstanding her huge and understandable\nmistrust of the media which started with the fall-out from the sudden death of her Father and has\ncontinued to this day. Despite the tremendous ramping of press interest in her follouing the death of\nJeffrey Epstein in August 2ol9 Ghislaine remained living in the States. This was primarily so that she could\nbe with her family but also to ensure she was available to deal with any civil or even criminal allegations\narising from her past connection to Epstein should these arise. When the press intrusion became too\nintense, she removed herself from the family home to protect her Spouse i Any reports to\nthe effect Ghislaine took that decision to evade law enforcement are as far from the truth as they are\noffensive.\nMy husband and | experienced first-hand what it felt like to be on the receiving end of such relentless press\nintrusion in our oun lives in the UK. We had to leave our home for a week because the press presence was\nSO aggressive and so constant: we had phone calls, emails, leters, visits - and everyone in our village was\nspoken to. Even my parents and children were harassed. JG hislaine’s house in\nLondon and today still there are journalists knocking on the door and filming the house. Ghislaine was\nterrified of being found by the press, or by deranged individuals and conspiracy theorists who threatened\nto harm her. A UK newspaper (The Sun) put up a bounty for information leading to her discovery. She had\nto isolate herself to protect her family and friends as much as herself. | spent a couple of days and nights\nwith her in October 2ol9 — we went for a walk and | directly experienced for myself the pressure and fear\nshe was living under.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document58l Filed ol/24/22 Pagelof5\nHolland & Knight\n3l West 52nd Street | New York, NY lool9 | T 2l2.5l3.32oo | F 2l2.385.9olo\nHolland & Knight LLP | www.hklaw.com\nChristine N.

Although Juror 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the outcome of this\ncase, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal case.

Collins, 2ol3 WL\n478o927, at *l (E.D. Wis. 2ol3).\n\nThe second request by Juror 5o is for discovery. Ms. Maxwell’s position, to be more fully\narticulated in her forthcoming substantive response to this Motion, is that this request should be\ndenied. For purposes of the issue concerning maintaining the seal on public access, discovery\nrequests are not “judicial documents.” United States v. Smith, 985 F.

According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l29", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l3 of 32\n\nThe government’s invocation of Tanner and Janniello is strikingly disingenuous. Both\ncases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in\n“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at ll9, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866\nF.2d at 543.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, xa\nRes conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance\nof courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into hou the jury reached its decision\nsimply has no relevance here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.\n\nIn fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second\nCircuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations\nby ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a post-trial\njury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to harassment and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(motion to intervene to assert the public’s First Amendment right of access to criminal\nproceedings is proper). Nor is the request from a subpoena respondent. See United States\nv. RMI Co., 599 F.2d ll83, ll86 (3d Cir. l979) (persons affected by the disclosure of\nallegedly privileged materials may intervene in pending criminal proceedings and seek\nprotective orders). Although Juror No. 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the\noutcome of this case, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal\ncase. This is a recognition of the general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v.\nRichard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973). And as one court has noted, “[e]ven crime victims,\nwho enjoy various statutory rights of participation, have no right to intervene in the\ndistrict court in a criminal case.” United States v. Collins, 2ol3 WL 478o927, at *l (E.D.\nWis. 2ol3).\n\nB. This Court should refuse Juror No. 5o’s discovery request because\nJuror No. 5o is under investigation and the release of the information\nrequested would prejudice that investigation.\n\nIt is the conduct of Juror No. 5o that is under investigation here. Like many\nsuspects, Juror No. 5o would like to learn as much information about the investigation so\nthat he can tailor responses to any potential questions and change the focus of the\ninvestigation. Once he was thoroughly tipped off by the government, Juror No. 5o has\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo975l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them. So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and impartial. See id. at l34:l5-22.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 58 qualified prospective jurors and was ultimately one of the l2\njurors who deliberated.\n\nWl. Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 32\n\nThe government’s invocation of Tanner and Janniello is strikingly disingenuous. Both\ncases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in\n“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at ll9, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866\nF.2d at 543.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, there is at least one juror who falsely answered voir dire\nquestions to gain a seat on the jury, conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance\nof courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into hou the jury reached its decision\nsimply has no relevance here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.\n\nIn fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second\nCircuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations\nby ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a post-trial\njury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to harassment and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a <span class=\"highlight\">journalist</span> for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

FRE 6o6 Did Not Prevent Inquiry into Juror 5o’s Use of Prior Abuse in\n\nPersuading Jury to Convict Maxwell\n\nThe court erred in applying Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6 to preclude any\ntestimony from Juror 5o about his statements to journalists.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b) precludes a juror from testifying about deliberations\nand jurors’ mental processes in the course thereof but allous testimony regarding\nextraneous prejudicial information, i.e., when certain outside influences on the jury\nare involved. Rule 6o6(b) expressly authorizes jurors to testify as to “extraneous\nprejudicial information” or “outside influences.” The rationale behind 6o6(b) is the\nneed to prevent post-trial scrutiny, the harassment of former jurors by losing\nparties, and to promote juror privacy. See, Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7\n(l987).\n\nIn this case, houever, we are not faced with a conflict between policy\nconsiderations underlying Rule 6o6(b). Indeed, such public policy concerns are\ninapplicable in this case, where the juror, on his oun, broadcast his experiences\nand the role he played in jury deliberations. Inquiry into these statements does not\nrisk exposing a juror to harassment or intimidation. In fact, the only reason the\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll32", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021712.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page65 of 93\n52\n\nhe indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court,\nand not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, bias, sym-\npathy, or prejudice.” (A.295). He also accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a\ncriminal case is presumed innocent and the Govern-\nment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. (A.294). Juror 5o indicated that there was noth-\ning about the nature of the case and the accusations as\nsummarized in the questionnaire that might make it\ndifficult for him to be fair and impartial. (A.3o8; see\nalso A.3lo). He repeated these assurances at oral voir\ndire. (See Voir Dire Tr.l28-34).\n\nJuror 5o checked the “no” box in response to Ques-\ntion 48, which asked whether he or a friend or family\nmember had ever been the victim of sexual harass-\nment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. (A.3lo). He also\nchecked the “no” box in response to the question of\nwhether he or any of his relatives or close friends had\never been a victim of a crime. (A.299).\n\nJuror 5o was seated. Follouing the verdict, he dis-\ncussed his experience as a juror during interviews with\nmultiple journalists. During these interviews, Juror 5o\nstated that he was a survivor of childhood sexual\nabuse, which he did not disclose until high school, and\nthat his experience of sexual abuse did not affect his\nability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven\nguilty. (A.249). He also stated that he did not recall the\ndetails of the juror questionnaire, which he “flew\nthrough,” but he believed he answered the questions\nhonestly. (A.245, 262).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021724.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page77 of 93\n64\nJuror 5o credibly testified at the hearing that he was\nable to put aside his experience of sexual abuse and\njudge the evidence fairly. This is not the sort of “ex-\ntreme situation that call[s] for mandatory removal.”\n(A.349 (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 46)).\n\nMore generally, it is entirely appropriate for jurors\nto “rely on their common sense and life experiences to\nadjudge guilt.” (A.352). These “very human elements\n... constitute one of the strengths of our jury system,\nand we cannot and should not excommunicate them\nfrom jury deliberations.” (A.353 (quoting United States\nex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l38, 8l8 (2d Cir.\nl97o)). On these facts, “[t]o imply or infer that Juror\n5o was biased—simply because he was himself a vic-\ntim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testi-\nmony under the penalty of perjury, establishing that\nhe could be an even-handed and impartial juror—\nwould be tantamount to concluding that an individual\nwith a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair\nand impartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law,\nnor should it be.” (A.346-47).\n\nFinally, Maxwell suggests that Judge Nathan\nabused her discretion by precluding defense counsel\nfrom questioning Juror 5o, and precluding inquiry into\nJuror 5o’s “statements to journalists.” (Br.7o). As to\nthe former, the manner in which the hearing proceeds\nis commited to a district court’s “sound discretion,”\nMoten, 582 F.2d at 666, including specifically the “ex-\ntent to which the parties may participate in question-\ning the witnesses,” lannielo, 866 F.2d at 544. Judge\nNathan reasonably decided to lead the questioning\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l724", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021725.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page78 of 93\n65\nherself, with repeated opportunities both before and\nduring the hearing for counsel to suggest questions.\nAnd Judge Nathan’s decision is reinforced by counsel’s\nrequests for “vexatious, intrusive, unjustified” subpoe-\nnas (SA365), and for questions that swept well beyond\nJuror 5o’s ability to be an impartial juror and instead\nprobed deeply into “other aspects of his life” (Br.69).\nAs to Juror 5o’s “statements to journalists,” it is not\nentirely clear which statements Maxwell thinks\nshould have been part of the hearing. The hearing of\ncourse covered both the substance of his sexual abuse\nand the fact of his statements to journalists. (See, e.g.,\nA.275 (asking whether Juror 5o understood “from your\ninterviews that the fact that you were abused would be\na knoun fact in the world.”)). It appears that, in Max-\nwell’s view, Judge Nathan should have inquired into\nwhether and hou his sexual abuse affected the delib-\nerations in the jury room. (Br.7l (suggesting that Ju-\nror 5o “operate[d] as an unsworn expert on the subject\nof traumatic memory”)). Acknouledging Rule 6o6(b)’s\nprohibition on inquiry into jurors’ deliberations and\nmental processes, Maxwell argues that the exception\nfor “extraneous prejudicial information [that] was im-\nproperly brought to the jury’s atention,” Fed. R. Evid.\n6o6(b)(2)(A), applies here. (Br.7l). But Maxwell ex-\npressly waived this argument in the District Court, ex-\nplaining that she “[d]oes not seek to impeach the ver-\ndict based on the content of deliberations” and “need\nnot inquire into the content of deliberations to estab-\nlish her jury bias claim.” (Dkt.6l3 at 49-5o). And in\nany event, the exception does not apply because the\n“experiences that jurors are understood to bring with\nthem to the jury room” are “internal maters” that do\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l725", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022522.jpg": "Page l3o\nl who's a famous <span class=\"highlight\">journalist</span>, actually is a very well\n2 knoun <span class=\"highlight\">journalist</span>.\n3 And when I -- and he had -- he was friends\n4 with the Barings, Barings Bank and he had like, sort\n5 of --\n6 TODD BLANCHE: That was, you're talking\n7 about --\n8 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Before he met me.\n9 TODD BLANCHE: Before, so in the --\nlo GHISLAINE MAXWELL: \"8os.\nll TODD BLANCHE: -- '8os.

But that's Jeffrey.\"\nMost Wall Streeters, houever, aren't even certain what Epstein actually does for a living. \"My belief is that Jeff\nmaintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him,\" says one\npouerful investor. \"He once told me that he has 3oo people working for him, and I've also heard he manages\nRockefeller money. But one never knous. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz.\"\nSome say that Epstein once quit his seat on the board of the Rockefeller Institute because he hates wearing a\nsuit, Supposedly telling a friend, \"It feels like wearing a dress.\"\nhtp://pqapepAarchiver.com/ny post/22249393 | .htpyleMAGsodb3 73aedch l qi par atRodequedr KOU PMS\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032090.jpg": "Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery Page 3 of 4\nspecies represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society <span class=\"highlight\">journalist</span> David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o"};
