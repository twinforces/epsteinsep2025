Mr. Indyke\nrelated that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and\nmentor Mr. Diaz.\n\nA final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:\n\nWhile working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a\nrelationship with the cleaning man who details our office space.

One night our sign language, broken\nEnglish and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter atending\ncollege. Alfredo told me hou proud he is of her atending college. “Me\ndaughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which\nled to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,\nMister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to\nme he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the\ndream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such\nconsequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one\n\n: man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical insurance.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233"};
