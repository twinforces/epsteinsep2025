As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US\ncriminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any subsequent UK extradition\nproceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to\nbe considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is\nmade, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition\nrequest, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against\nthe grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.\n\nD. The bars to extradition that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face extradition to\n\nthe US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n24. The offences in the superseding indictment are extradition offences within the meaning of section l37\n\nof the Extradition Act 2oo3”.\n\n25.
