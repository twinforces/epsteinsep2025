Maxwell contends that the Government\nhas alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a\nsingle offense as an offense multiple times, in separate\ncounts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been\ncommited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45\n(2d Cir. l999). “The multiplicity doctrine is based upon\nthe double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its\nlegislative authorization by imposing multiple punish-\nments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian,\n82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987) (cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital,\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against\nsimultaneous <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same offense, so\nlong as no more than one punishment is eventually\nimposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o,\n355 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this\nCircuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.”\nUnited States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272 (PGG), 2ol4\nWL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2ol4) (collecting\ncases). The Court therefore denies Maxwell’s motion to\ndismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool46", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000196.jpg": "a\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES .............. i\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF\nl.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l2\nIV. The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here\n\nFinally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the\nappropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and\ncertainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted\nbail, refrain from fleeing so he could atempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.\nNevertheless, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn.\n\nA. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution\n\nAs an initial mater, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this\nweek, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond\nthe scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New\nYork based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient\nto put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious\nchallenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and\nadditional charges brought based on New York conduct.\n\nBut more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District\nof New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA\noverwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to\nthe SDFL. The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander\nAcosta, United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for\nthese offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final\nparagraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms\nof the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this\nAgreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that\narose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.”\n\nIn its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed\nas an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as\nto any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA,\nand additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil\nsetlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver\nof any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.” These provisions shou the parties\ncontemplated possible criminal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not\ninitially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final\nsubstantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.”\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “‘a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v.

App’x 92o, 92l\n7 All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo34o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000398.jpg": "CTasecesb9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentl8 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page l2 ofl8 l2\n\nl prior to the government's entering the agreement.\n\n2 The Department of Justice at the time did not believe\n3 the CVRA extended absent a federal charge.

An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v.

It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings.

The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same offense.”\nUnited States v.

Sabath, 99o F. Supp. loo7, lol8 (N.D. Ill. l998) (quoting,\nBLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY l27o (6th ed.l99o)).\n\nAs noted by Chief Judge McMahon in United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n488-9l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), “[t]he Second Circuit has never specifically declined to adopt the\nLovasco ‘Footnote l7’ test (as restated in Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Dollars). Nor has\nit specifically found that pre-indictment delay engendered in reckless disregard of circumstances\nthat would likely impede a defendant's ability to mount a defense can never violate the Due\nProcess Clause.”\n\nCourts generally agree that (l) “tactical, reckless, or bad faith preindictment delay that\nunduly prejudices a defendant is constitutionally dubious,” United States v. McNeal, No. o3 CR\n8o, 2oo6 WL 76ol86, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 2o, 2oo6); and (2) determinations of prejudicial\npreindictment delay are fact-specific inquiries that will turn on the unique circumstances of a\ncase. See Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324-25; Lovasco, 43l US. at 797.4\n\nThis is that case.\n\n4 Several Circuit Courts of Appeal interpret Marion/Lovasco as requiring a balancing test that\nweighs the prejudice to a defendant against the government's reasons for the delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Valentine, 783 F.2d l4l3, l4l6 (9th Cir. l986); Houell v. Barker, 9o4 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.\nl99o); United States v. Soua, 34 F.3d 447, 45l (7th Cir. l994); United States v. Moran, 759 F.2d 777,\n782 (9th Cir. l985). See also United States v. Collamore, 75l F. Supp. lol2, lo27 (D. Me. l99o), aff'd,\n94o F.2d 646 (lst Cir. l99l) (quotation omited) (holding that a defendant may shou a due process\nviolation based on excessive preindictment delay incurred in reckless disregard of circumstances, knoun\nto the prosecution, suggesting that there existed an appreciable risk that delay would impair the ability to\nmount an effective defense); and Schurman v. Leonardo, 768 F. Supp. 993, 998 (S.D.N.Y. l99l)\n(recognizing reckless disregard standard). Legal commentators have, for many years, discussed the\nCircuit split regarding the test to be applied to claims of pre-indictment delay and called for the U.S.\nSupreme Court to resolve the mater. See, e.g., Phyllis Goldfarb, “When Judges Abandon Analogy: The\nProblem of Delay in Commencing Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecutions</span>,” 3l WM. & MARY L. REV. 6o7 (l99o); Eli\nDuBosar, “Pre-Accusation Delay: An Issue Ripe for Adjudication by the United States Supreme Court,”\n4o FLA. ST. U. L. REV. 659 (2ol3); see also Hoo v. United States, 484 U.S. lo35, lo36 (l988), where\nJustice White noted that he would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits on this\nimportant question of constitutional law.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 38\nthe NPA clearly intended to confer a benefit on any and all of Epstein’s potential co-conspirators\nin explicitly giving them immunity. Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the protection provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was intentional, as demonstrated by the express references\nelsewhere in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 38\nUnited States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985). Annabi supports dismissal here by\nconfirming that where, as here, both the text of the NPA and the facts and circumstances of the\nunderlying negotiations demonstrate an intent to bind the United States (other USAQs), they are\nso bound. Alternatively, any application of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL\nwould conflict with the likely interpretation of the NPA by the Eleventh Circuit, which should\napply in case of any such conflict.\n\nThird, the government argues that the co-conspirator immunity provision prohibits only\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for (i) conduct between 2ool and 2oo7 and (i) statutory offenses specifically\nreferenced in the factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision\ncontains no such limitations and thus forecloses this argument. The text is clear, but even if it\nwere ambiguous, it must be strictly construed against the government.\n\nIn the alternative, to the extent there is any doubt that the NPA bars this prosecution, the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the NPA at least raise sufficient issues regarding the parties’\nintent to warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Accordingly, if the\nindictment is not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell requests leave to conduct discovery as to the intent of\nthe parties to the NPA with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, as well as an\nevidentiary hearing in aid of this Motion.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nOn or about September 24, 2oo7, Epstein and his counsel entered into the NPA with\nAcosta, the United States Atorney for the SDFL.* While USAOs in a number of judicial\ndistricts, including this District, typically use a standard template for plea agreements and other\nnon-prosecution agreements, this NPA did not follou such a standard format. To the contrary,\n\n* A copy of the NPA is atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2584", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 38\nparties to the NPA clearly intended to confer immunity on potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\nsuch as Ms. Maxwell.\n\nB. The NPA’s Prohibition on Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is Not\n\nLimited to the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA stands in contrast to the standard non-prosecution agreement used in this\nDistrict and other jurisdictions, which typically is explicitly limited to prohibit only <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>\nby the USAO for the district in which the plea is entered. The standard agreement in this District\ncontains the follouing language: “It is further understood that this Agreement does not bind any\nfederal, state, or local prosecuting authority other than this Office.” See, e.g., Perez v. United\nStates, Nos. l4 Civ. 846, o4 Cr. 937-l, 2ol5 WL 34l3596 , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). No such\nlanguage is included in the NPA. Moreover, unlike the standard agreement, the NPA refers\nseparately to “the United States” in some places and to the USAO-SDFL in others, in ways that\nmake clear that any reference to “the United States” was intended to refer to the government as a\nwhole, not merely the USAO-SDFL.\n\nl. The NPA is binding on the USAO in this District.\n\nThe government’s contention that the NPA does not bind the USAO in this District\ncannot be squared with the clear language of the co-conspirator immunity provision. On its face,\nthat provision does not limit the preclusive effect of the NPA as to potential co-conspirators to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> in the SDFL. Indeed, consistent with Epstein’s desire to obtain the broadest\nimmunity possible, the NPA expressly provides that, in exchange for Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms and conditions therein, “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” with no express geographic\nlimitation. NPA at 5 (emphasis added). In contrast, the clauses regarding the non-prosecution of\nEpstein expressly defer “prosecution in this District’ and provide that no prosecution for the\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2595", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 26 of 38\nprovision as to Epstein. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., 424\nF.3d l95, 2o6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“In interpreting a contract under New York law, ‘words and\nphrases ... should be given their plain meaning,’ and the contract ‘should be construed so as to\ngive full meaning and effect to all of its provisions.’”) (citations omited); Port Consol., Inc. v.\nInt’l Ins. Co. of Hannover, PLC, 826 F. App’x 822, 827 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (same under Florida\nlaw). The Justice Manual supports this view, admonishing prosecutors who do not wish to bind\nUSAOs in other districts to “explicitly limit the scope” of the NPA to their districts. Justice\nManual, Comment to § 9-27.63o (emphasis added). The absence of the phrase “in this District”\nfrom the co-conspirator immunity provision therefore compels the opposite inference: that the\nparties did not intend to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the SDFL.\n\nMoreover, “a promise to bind other districts can be inferred from the negotiations\nbetween defendant and prosecutor.” Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626. One relevant factor in this analysis\nis the extent to which the USAO negotiating the plea agreement acted on its oun, as opposed to\ninvolving other USAOs or other offices within the Department of Justice. Cf, e.g., United States\nv. D’Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 32l, 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (finding that defendant “offers no\nmeaningful support for his claim that he ‘reasonably understood’ the Agreement to bar\nsubsequent <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> in this District... . He does not claim, for example, that the SDNY\nUSAO was in any way consulted or involved in the plea negotiations.”); United States v.\nLaskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y.) (“defendants concede [] that the Central District had\nno knouledge of the investigation that was taking place in the Eastern District at the time the\nCentral District plea was being negotiated. .. .

Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”).

Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 22 of 25\nU.S.C. § 3283. Counts One and Two arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), which, at the time of the\nalleged conduct, provided that a person could be charged with a criminal offense if she\n“knouingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to travel in interstate or\nforeign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, to engage in\nprostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996) (emphasis added). That statute criminalizes enticing\n“individual[s],” not necessarily children, to cross state lines to engage in sexual activities. In\nother words, the act that violates § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail the enticement of a child\nto travel, because the enticement of an individual of any age satisfies the statute.\n\nFurther, § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail “sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283. A substantive § 2422(a) offense is complete when an individual is\n“nersuade[d], induce[d], entice[d], or coerce[d]” to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity,\nand a conspiracy to commit such an offense is complete when an agreement to “persuade[],\ninduce[], entice[], or coerce[]” an individual to engage in such travel is reached and a single\novert act is commited in furtherance of the agreement. It is immaterial to either offense whether\nany unlawful sexual activity subsequently occurs. Moreover, the intended unlawful sexual\nactivity required to establish a § 2422(a) offense need not involve “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping”; § 2422(a) is frequently, if not primarily, invoked in <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> involving the\nenticement of adults to travel to engage in prostitution, including on a voluntary basis. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rashkovski, 3ol F.3d ll33, ll35-37 (9th Cir. 2oo2).

To the contrary, there are affirmative indications in the text that\nthe NPA applies only to the USAO-SDFL. Accordingly, under Annabi, the NPA is only binding\non the USAO-SDFL, and the defendant’s motion fails as a mater of law.\n\nZ. The Defendant Has Offered No Evidence That the NPA Binds Other\nDistricts\n\nAlthough a defendant may offer evidence that the negotiations between the prosecutor and\ndefendant contained a promise to bind other districts, Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626, the defendant has\nfailed to do so here. The defendant’s motion is replete with bare assertions and conclusory\nallegations, but it fails to point to any evidence that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY.\n\nThe lone document the defendant offers in support of her motion is a privilege log filed by\nthe USAO-SDFL in connection with a lawsuit filed by Epstein’s victims. (Def. Mot. | at 22). The\nlog reflects that the FBI agents working with the USAO-SDFL interviewed witnesses in other\nstates—including New York—during their investigation. That is entirely unremarkable, since\nfederal investigations frequently involve gathering evidence in other states. This does not in any\nway establish the substantive involvement of any other districts in the prior investigation, let alone\nthat the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the U.S. Atorney’s offices in those states would be\nbound by the NPA.\n\n* Interpreting the term “federal liability” in this provision could not be read to encompass all U.S.\nAtorney’s offices without also interpreting its neighboring term, “state . . . liability,” to refer to\nevery state prosecutor’s office in all fifty states. The USAO-SDFL clearly did not—and could\nnot—make such a broad promise.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo297o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 239\nGovernment’s promises in the plea agreement to only cover past crimes, observing that “not\nlimiting the prohibition to past crimes would make it absurd and probably illegal”) (citing Aronson\nv. K. Arakelian, Inc., l54 F.2d 23l, 233 (7th Cir. l946) (“[A] contract will not be presumed to\nhave imposed an absurd or impossible condition on one of the parties, but will be interpreted as\nthe parties must be supposed to have understood the conditions at the time.”)).\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the NPA covers all violations of the Mann Act. (Def.\nMot. | at 26 n.4). Not so. The NPA lists specific statutory provisions within the Mann Act, but\nnone of the provisions contained in the Indictment. In particular, the NPA expressly covers\nviolations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), and 2423(e), but it does not include the particular\nprovisions charged in the Indictment against Maxwell, which alleges violations of §§ 2422(a) and\n2423(a). These are plainly not the same crimes, and a plea agreement cannot be read to immunize\nunnamed crimes in the general ballpark of the specific crimes enumerated in the agreement. The\ndefendant cites no authority that supports her overbroad reading of this provision.\n\nAccordingly, the NPA immunizes only certain, specific offenses, none of which are\ncontained in the Indictment. As a result, the defendant cannot invoke the NPA to seek the dismissal\nof the Indictment.\n\n2. The NPA Does Not Confer Enforceable Rights on Maxwell\n\nEven if this Court were to construe the NPA beyond its plain terms to preclude <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>\nfor the crimes contained in the Indictment, the defendant has established neither that those\nprotections extend to Maxwell specifically, nor that she has standing to pursue those protections.\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to interpret the NPA according to contract principles, and\naccord the defendant standing to enforce the NPA as a third party beneficiary. As a general mater,\nplea agreements are interpreted using principles from contract law, but that maxim is not without\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2978", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 239\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell argues that Section 3283 is inapplicable because the offenses\ncharged in the Indictment do not “involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse .. . of a child.” (Def.\nMot. 2 at l2-l4). Yet her argument runs contrary to the weight of authority that has adopted the\ncommon-sense view that crimes that necessarily entail the sexual or physical abuse of children\n“involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse of a child.” This Court should do the same and deny the\nmotion.\n\nA. Statutory Background\n\nBetween l99o and 2oo6, Congress passed a series of laws that expanded the statute of\nlimitations for <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of crimes against minors, ultimately extending the statute of\nlimitations to the lifetime of the minor victim and, for certain offenses, eliminating the statute of\nlimitations entirely. These laws reflect a virtually unbroken congressional policy that the default\nfive-year statute of limitations for federal crimes, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, is inadequate for such\noffenses. An extended statute of limitations is necessary because “child sex abuse offenses . . .\nmay be difficult to detect quickly,” in part because children often first report their abuse long after\nit occurs. Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (citing, e.g., David McCord,\nExpert Psychological Testimony About Child Complainants in Sexual Abuse <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecutions</span>, 77 J.\nCrim. L. & Criminology l, 6o-6l (l986)).\n\nIn l99o, Congress enacted a new statute of limitation for certain crimes against children,\nwhich stated: “No statute of limitation that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such a\nprosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control Act of l99o, Pub. L. No.\nlol-647, tit. II, § 225(a), lo4 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k) (l99o)). In l994,\nCongress re-codified this provision, moving it to l8 U.S.C. § 3283 with identical language.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2985", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 239\nof § 35o9(k) applied to conduct predating its enactment in l99o)). The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual\nabuse, but the legislative history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a child could not be prosecuted\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\nidentified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express intention was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 amendment extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Broun, 8oo F. App’x 455, 46l (9th Cir. 2o2o) (2ol4 indictment charging,\namong other crimes, sex trafficking offenses dating to 2ooo and 2ool), cert. denied, No. 2o-5o64,\n-- 8. Ct. -- , 2o2l WL 78235 (Jan. ll, 2o2l); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM),\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo299o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 239\nthe resurrection of time-barred <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>, in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.'4 But that\nconcern is entirely separate from extending the statute of limitations for live claims, which is what\nCongress did here. Critically—and as discussed in greater detail belou—there is no Ex Post Facto\nClause issue in this case, because the statute of limitations for Counts One through Four had not\nyet expired when the limitations period was extended in 2oo3.\"\n\nAccepting the defendant’s argument would undermine Congress’s plain purpose in\nextending the limitations period. In l99o, 2oo3, and 2oo6, Congress extended—and ultimately\nabolished—the statute of limitations to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex\nabuse victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay. Applying the 2oo3 statute\nonly prospectively subverts that purpose by exempting all past offenders. According to the\n‘4 Moreover, the fact that Congress considered, but ultimately omited, retroactivity language does\nnot end the Landgraf inquiry, as the defendant suggests. Indeed, Landgraf itself makes this clear.\nIn that case, the statute at issue had a predecessor, which contained a retroactivity provision. That\nversion was vetoed by the President, and the final version of the statute omited the retroactivity\nprovision. As the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he omission of the elaborate retroactivity\nprovision of the l99o bill—which was by no means the only source of political controversy over\nthat legislation—is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was\nstruck in the l99l Act.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256. Indeed, “[i]t [was] entirely possible—indeed,\nhighly probable—that, because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of\nthe l99o legislation, Congress viewed the mater as an open issue to be resolved by the courts.”\nTd. at 26l.\n\n'S Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 were both younger than 25 in 2oo3, when Congress\nextended the limitations period. Minor Victim-3 was not, but this does not alter the inquiry,\nbecause the Indictment does not contain any counts that relate to Minor Victim-3 alone. Instead,\nshe is one of multiple victims of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. The inclusion\nof the overt acts relating to Minor Victim-3 in an otherwise timely conspiracy count does not\nrender that count untimely. To the contrary, for conspiracy counts, the Government is only\nrequired to prove that one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred within the limitations\nperiod. United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2ool). Thus, the defendant is incorrect\nto assert that the government is “barred” from prosecuting the defendant for any offense against\nMinor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 2 at lo, n.3). Instead, there is no statute of limitations issue here so\nlong as the jury is properly instructed at trial that it must find at least one overt act within the\nlimitations period—i.e., one overt act that does not relate to Minor Victim-3.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2992", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 239\n\nmuch violence is done to our instinctive feelings of justice and fair\n\nplay. For the state to assure a man that he has become safe from its\n\npursuit, and thereafter to withdraw its assurance, seems to most of\n\nus unfair and dishonest. But, while the chase is on, it does not shock\n\nus to have it extended beyond the time first set, or, if it does, the\n\nstake forgives it.\nFalter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o, 425-26 (2d Cir. l928). The distinction between statutes that\nrevive expired <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> and those that extend existing limitations periods has deep roots in\nestablished jurisprudence. It is well-setled that the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that revive\ntime-barred <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>, but permits laws that retroactively extend limitations periods. Stogner\nv. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632 (2oo3) (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not “prevent\nthe State from extending time limits for . . . <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> not yet time barred.”); United States v.\nMorgan, ll3 F.3d l23o, l997 WL 2687l2, at *7 (2d Cir. l997) (unpublished opinion) (“The long-\nstanding rule in this circuit is that Congress has the pouer to extend the period of limitations\nwithout running afoul of the ex post facto clause, provided the original period has not already\nrun.”’) (citing Falter, 23 F.3d at 425-26). And other circuits have emphasized this distinction in\nthe context of Section 3283. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d, at 922-25; Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 685.\n\nRead together, the Second Circuit’s decisions in Weingarten, Vernon, Enterprise, and\nFalter establish that Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. That is precisely what has occurred here, because the charges in the Indictment were\nstill timely when the 2oo3 amendment extended the limitations period. As a result, applying\nSection 3283 in this case does not create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore, step two of\nLandgraf is satisfied, and Section 3283 applies retroactively.\n\nResisting this conclusion, the defendant asserts that, in the criminal context, Landgraf’s\nsecond step provides protections beyond the Ex Post Facto Clause. But that is not the law. See\nNader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63o (rejecting the argument that “there is ‘daylight’ between the Ex Post\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2995", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 239\nFacto Clause and Landgraf’s second step.”). Maxwell cites no precedent for the proposition that,\nin the criminal context, much less in the context of criminal statutes of limitations, Landgraf\nforecloses <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> permited by the Constitution. Maxwell instead cites dictum by a single\njudge in a non-criminal case that, “[i]f [he] were judging on a clean slate,” he would read Landgraf\nto prohibit some retroactive application of statutes that, “while not the equivalent of criminal ex\npost facto, nevertheless would run afoul of’ Landgraf’s considerations, and that he “expect[ed]\nthat the Supreme Court’s future decisions” would confirm such a reading. Thom v. Ashcroft, 369\nF.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., “[s]peaking only for [him]self’). That footnote is\ntoo slender a reed to support Maxwell’s entire motion to dismiss the Indictment as untimely.\nMoreover, Maxwell has identified no case in the intervening seventeen years in which the Supreme\nCourt has embraced Judge Calabresi’s view. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l (finding arguments\nrelating to Judge Calabresi’s footnote unpersuasive, and concluding that Section 3283 applies\nretroactively under Landgraf). As Weingarten recognized, any court to hold that “retroactively\nextending a filing period for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under\nLandgraf’ will be the first to do so. 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nThe defendant also argues that “criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose,” relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S.\nll2, ll5 (l97o). Toussie considered whether a person’s failure to register for the draft was a\ncontinuing offense subjecting him to prosecution eight years later, notwithstanding the five-year\nlimitations period in Section 3282. /d. at ll4. In that context, the Court invoked a presumption\nin favor of repose when determining whether the underlying conduct was time-barred. But that\npresumption says nothing about whether Congress intended an extension of a statute of limitations\nto apply purely prospectively, a question governed by Landgraf. Only one case has applied\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2996", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002997.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 239\nToussie to the Landgraf analysis, see United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7), and that case, which did not concern Section 3283, relied extensively on a pre-Landgraf\nopinion requiring a clear statement of congressional intent in favor of retroactivity. See id. at 655\n(citing United States v. Richardson, 5l2 F.2d lo5 (3d Cir. l975)). That clear-statement rule is\ninconsistent with the analysis required by Landgraf step two. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l\n(rejecting an identical argument relying on Toussie and Gentile).\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to break new ground and become the first court to hold that\nSection 3283 applies only prospectively. The Court should reject this invitation. For the reasons\nset forth above, the weight of authority holds that Section 3283 applies retroactively, in keeping\nwith Congress’s express intent to expand <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of individuals who sexually exploit\nchildren. The Indictment is timely, and the motion should be denied.\n\nC. The Defendant’s Crimes Involved the Sexual Abuse of Minors\n\nThe defendant next argues that Section 3283 does not apply at all, and she asks the Court\nto conclude that the crimes of sexual abuse alleged in the Indictment did not involve sexual abuse.\nHer argument runs contrary to both the case law and common sense. Her motion is meritless and\nshould be denied.\n\nBy its terms, Section 3283 applies to any “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse,\nor kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. As discussed above, when\nthe statute was first enacted, it was located at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k). The definition of the term\n“sexual abuse” is located in a neighboring provision within that same section:\n\nFor purposes of this section . . . the term ‘sexual abuse’ includes the\nemployment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\nof a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2997", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 239\n(Def. Mot. 4, Ex. H at 9). “That knouledge,” the Court explained, “goes directly to the truth or\nfalsity of the alleged defamation, a key element of Plaintiffs claim.” (/d.). The Court therefore\nordered the defendant to answer the questions related to her sexual activity with or involving (l)\nEpstein, (2) Giuffre, (3) underage girls knoun to Epstein or who she thought might become knoun\nto Epstein, or (4) involving massage with individuals the defendant “knew to be, or believed might\nbe, knoun to Epstein.” (/d. at lo). The Court further ordered the defendant to answer questions\nabout her knouledge of the sexual activities of others in the same four categories. The Court added\nthat the “scope of Defendant’s answers are not bound by time period, though Defendant need not\nanswer questions that relate to none of these subjects or that is clearly not relevant.” (/d.). The\ndefendant sat for a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6, before the case setled.\n\nAs discussed more fully belou, the Indictment charges the defendant with two counts of\nperjury, one arising from statements made during the April 2ol6 deposition and one arising from\nstatements made during the July 2ol6 deposition. Indictment 9 2l, 23. (Ex. lo at 253:25-254:8,\n384:l5-2o; Ex. ll at 88:9-89:l3, 9l:22-92:l6, ll3:2-l2). The defendant nou moves to dismiss\nboth counts, arguing that the Court can effectively decide nou, as a mater of law, that the questions\nwere fundamentally ambiguous, her answers were true, and her answers were immaterial to the\ncase.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nSection l623(a) imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a).\nIn perjury <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>, “whether the witness believes that an answer is true or false generally\nturns on the declarant’s understanding of the question.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372\n(2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, and as is true of virtually all factual issues, “[a] jury is best equipped\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 239\n\nA. I interviewed people for jobs for professional things and I am not\naware of anyone aside from nou Virginia who clearly was a\nmasseuse aged l7 but that’s, at least that’s hou far we knou that I\ncan think of that fulfilled any professional capacity for Jeffrey.\nQ. List all the people under the age of l8 that you interacted with at\nany of Jeffrey’s properties?\nA. I'm not aware of anybody that I interacted with, other than\nobviously Virginia who was l7 at this point?\n\n(Ex. lo at 382:4-384:2o).\n\nThe defendant argues that this question was “grossly ambiguous: who was ‘Jeffrey’; what\nwere ‘Jeffrey’s properties;’ to what time frame did the question apply; what was the basis for Ms.\nMaxwell to determine who may or may not have been ‘under the age of l8’; and what did ‘interact\nwith’ mean?” (Def. Mot. 4 at ll). These arguments only underscore the principle that perjury\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> are an inquiry into “the natural meaning in the context in which words were used,”\nBonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l, and not an opportunity for defense counsel to “plumb[] a question\nfor post hoc ambiguity,” Strohm, 67l F.3d at ll78. A reasonable jury, after hearing the evidence,\ncould readily conclude that the natural meaning of those words in context is abundantly clear. For\ninstance, at the end of trial, a jury could conclude that “Jeffrey” is Jeffrey Epstein; “Jeffrey’s\nproperties” are Jeffrey Epstein’s properties, including his houses in Palm Beach, New York, New\nMexico, and the United States Virgin Islands (see, e.g., Ex. lo at 248:l7-2o (naming those\nproperties)); and “interact” is an expansive word aimed at capturing any encounter, that was used\nafter the defendant resisted words like “met,” “found,” and “hired” in the prior questions, see\nInteract, Oxford English Dictionary Online, htps://oed.com/view/Entry/975l8 (last visited\nFebruary 25, 2o2l) (“To act reciprocally, to act on each other.”).

Alfonso, l43 F.3d 772, 776-77 (2d. Cir. l998)).\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7 states in part that an indictment “must be a plain,\nconcise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged... .”\nFed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(l). There are two constitutional requirements an indictment must satisfy in\norder to be sufficient: first, it must “contain[] the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[] a defendant of the charge against which [s]he must defend,” and second, it must\n“enable[]” a defendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the\nsame offense.” United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Hamling, 4l8 U.S. at ll7). “[A]n indictment parroting the language of a\nfederal criminal statute is often sufficient ....” Jd. at lo9. As a general mater, “[a]n indictment\ndoes not... ‘have to specify evidence or details of hou the offence was commited.’” United\nStates v. Wey, No. l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan, l8, 2ol7) (emphasis\nin original) (quoting United States v. Coffey, 36l F. Supp. 2d lo2, ll (E.D.N.Y. 2oo5)). “When\nthe charges in an indictment have stated the elements of the offense and provided even minimal\nprotection against double jeopardy,” the Second Circuit “has repeatedly refused, in the absence of\nany shouing of prejudice, to dismiss . . . charges for lack of specificity.” United States v. Stringer,\n73o F.3d l2o, l24 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (ellipses in original) (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nUnited States v. Walsh, l94 F.3d. 37, 45 (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nAlthough courts have identified certain crimes for which an indictment may require greater\nspecificity beyond tracking the language of the statute, such cases are “very rare.” Stringer, 73o\nF.3d at l25. For example, the Second Circuit has clarified that within this “less-common category”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 239\n\nis particularly instructive here. See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,\nJudge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be\ncontained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be\nequally applicable in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follous\nhere. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through\nFour is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the\ndefendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided\nthe defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided discovery regarding each\nvictim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its\nwitnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch disclosure will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the\nsame offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in\nthe Indictment, is more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSecond, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in approximate terms)” of the conduct\nalleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d\nat ll3). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a\ncontinuing course of conduct involving the enticement and transportation of minors with intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about l994 and in or about\nl997. See Indictment 7 l, 6, 7, 9-ll, l3, l5-l7, l9. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently\nupheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386. F.\nSupp. 3d at 369 (“[Th]le Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used to\ndescribe the windou of when a violation occurred.” (citing United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d\nl294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)); United States v.

May 8, 2ol4) (denying motion to dismiss indictment charging\nenticement of a minor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 2423(a), “between in or about 2ooo to in or about\n2oo4,” because “the Indictment states all the elements of the crime charged by tracking the\nstatutory language,” as well as “the nature of the criminal activity” and “the underlying facts’).\n\n“This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse of\nunderage victims often proceed without specific dates of offenses,” including “[iJ]n cases of\ncontinuing sexual abuse,” for which “it is sufficient for the indictment to specify a period of time—\nrather than a specific date—in which defendant commited the acts at issue... .” United States v.\nYoung, No. o8 Cr. 285 (KMK), 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8) (internal\nquotation mark omited) (quoting Edwards v. Mazzuca, No. oo Civ. 229o (RJS), 2oo7 WL\n2994449, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l5, 2oo7)). Indeed, “[b]Jecause minors often are not capable of\nremembering the exact dates when the alleged acts occurred, ‘fairly large time windous in the\ncontext of child abuse <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> are not in conflict with constitutional notice requirements.’”\nYoung, 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (quoting Valentine v. Konteh, 395 F.3d 626, 632 (6th Cir. 2oo5)).\nThe same is true here. The minor victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the\nexact dates when particular instances of abuse took place during their adolescence. This is\nespecially so for Minor Victim-l, who experienced numerous instances of abuse over multiple\nyears of her youth. Providing the approximate ranges of dates during which the offenses took\nplace fully satisfies the requirements of an adequately pled charging instrument. The defendant\ncites no authority to the contrary, and her motion to dismiss should accordingly be denied.\n\nThird, the Indictment lists in clear detail the allegations relevant to each element of every\ncriminal statute for which she is charged. Beyond simply “parroting the language of a federal\ncriminal statute,” Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. at lo8, the Indictment provides extensive detail\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 239\n\na conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, to entice minors to travel with the intent to commit\nan illegal sex act, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). See Indictment 4 l5-l7. In other words,\nCount One and Count Three charge the defendant with agreeing to commit two separate and\ndistinct federal crimes.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the\nsame offense, a defendant does have a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury\nconvicts on more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple\npunishments for the same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only\none of the multiplicitous counts.” Jd. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already\nbeen entered on multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but\none count. /d.\n\nThe Second Circuit has clarified that District Courts should not rule on a motion to dismiss\na charge on multiplicity grounds until the time of sentencing. See id. (vacating district court’s\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l3l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 239\ndismissal of count as multiplicitous prior to trial, as such a determination before trial is “at best\npremature”). Among other reasons, courts look to “the record as a whole in determining whether\nan indictment is in fact multiplicitous,” and the record cannot be fully established until trial is\ncomplete. United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo9). Additionally, because\ndouble jeopardy is meant to protect a defendant from successive punishments for the same offense,\na multiplicitous count does not violate the Clause unless and until sentence is imposed. See\nJosephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same offense, so long\nas no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.”).\n\nFollouing the Second Circuit’s directive, courts in this Circuit regularly defer ruling on a\nmultiplicity motion until after the conclusion of trial. See, e.g., United States v. Halkbank, No. l5\nCr. 867 (RMB), 2o2o WL 58495l2, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l, 2o2o) (denying pretrial motion to\ndismiss multiplicitous count and noting that “‘[c]Jourts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-\ntrial motions to dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.’” (quoting United States v.\nMedina, No. l3 Cr. 272 (PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nI. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 46 of 348\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . .

The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue.

Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> that follou completed state\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**” By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask.

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

Like the government here, houever, the court in Nader offered no\npath to reconciling Landgraf with Toussie. Instead, it applied Landgraf, a civil case, in a manner\nthat interprets Toussie out of existence in the retroactivity context, without any suggestion from\nthe Supreme Court that it intended such an effect. The opinions in Miller and Gentile, in\nacknouledging the need to read Landgraf and Toussie in harmony, provide the correct legal\nframework for the application of the second step of Landgraf. This is particularly so in light of\nCongress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment, a factor not\nconsidered in Miller and absent from Gentile.\n\nIn arguing that “Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>” (Opp. 34) (emphasis added), the government completely misses the point.

No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi,\nSalameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no\nrestriction on <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of\nFlorida. The first states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer\n“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. l42-l at 2. The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal.

See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3688", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged.

This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements\n\nIn Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7-l8 (l974), the United States Supreme\nCourt explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply seting forth the offense in the\nwords of the statute may not suffice:\n\nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an\nacquital or conviction in bar of future <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same offense. It is\ngenerally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the\nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,\nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to\nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l2 of 23\ndemonstrated that the NPA, as a whole, gives rise to such an appearance—and the government\noffers no reasonable alternative interpretation.\n\nUnlike Annabi and its progeny, the NPA here contains significant evidence of the parties’\nintent to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL. While the provision\ngranting immunity to Epstein himself expressly limits his immunity to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> “in this\nDistrict,” NPA at 2, the co-conspirator immunity provision contains no such limitation.\n\n“TW |here contract provisions use different language, courts must assume the parties intended\ndifferent meanings.” Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co. v.

Instead, it argues that because the parties limited Epstein’s immunity to\nthe SDFL, they must have meant to limit co-conspirators’ immunity to the SDFL as well, but\nmust have forgoten to include the appropriate language. This argument—that the use of\ndifferent language in parallel provisions compels an inference that identical, rather than different\nmeanings, are intended—turns fundamental contract interpretation on its head.

By the government’s oun admission, Accuser-3 will not\ntestify, and the government cannot prove, that Accuser-3 Pe\neven if Accuser-3 testifies in accordance with the proffer, the government will be unable to\nestablish that she was transported or enticed to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity.“\n\nThe government argues that it “does not mater” whether Accuser-3 was an adult when\ninvited to travel (Opp. l62), because even evidence that she was invited to travel as an adult\nwould be “probative” of Ms. Maxwell’s “intent, in her initial interactions with [Accuser-3], to\nentice [Accuser-3] to travel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.” Opp.\nl63.

See, e.g., United States v. Sharpe, 438 F.3d\nl257, l263 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (“a district court is limited to reviewing the face of the indictment’) (emphasis in\noriginal); United States v.

As noted in\nour previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision of the NPA stands in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is\nexpressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt. 223 at 9-lo). The broad language of the co-conspirator\nprovision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his atorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFL, that\nhe would be “the only one who takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR Report at l67\n(internal quotations omited)). Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal “to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability,” which is set forth in the factual recitals of the\nNPA. (Ex. B at 2 of 7; see also Ex. D § 5 (declaration of AUSA A. Marie Villafafia noting that\nEpstein “sought a global resolution of the mater”). Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware\nthat the investigation had extended beyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses.\nIndeed, we nou knou from discovery recently produced by the government that the government\ninterviewed at least three New York-based witnesses in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation, two of whom implicated other potential co-conspirators of Epstein. (Exs. E-G).\nHence, these provisions of the NPA reflect Epstein’s desire to ensure that he would not become\nembroiled in subsequent <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of his “potential co-conspirators” in any other districts.\n(Dkt. 223 at ll).\n\nMoreover, this result is consistent with fundamental fairness.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 47 of 349\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 52 of 349\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 66 of 349\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. °*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4363", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision.

In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> that follou completed state\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2oo of 349\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4497", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 326 of 349\n\n3.

Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4.

Though this appeal emanates from Cosby’s\ncriminal convictions, we cannot ignore the true breadth of the due process violation. The\ndeprivation includes the fact that D.A. Castors actions handicapped Cosby in the\nderivative civil suit. Nor can we ignore the fact that weakening Cosby’s position in that\ncivil case was precisely why D.A. Castor proceeded as he did. Suppression of evidence\nin a third criminal trial can never restore Cosby to the position he held before he forfeited\nhis Fifth Amendment rights. The consequences of D.A. Castor’s actions include the civil\nmater, and no exclusion of deposition testimony can restore Cosby’s injuries in that\nregard.\n\nIt was not only the deposition testimony that harmed Cosby. As a practical mater,\nthe moment that Cosby was charged criminally, he was harmed: all that he had forfeited\nearlier, and the consequences of that forfeiture in the civil case, were for naught. This\nwas, as the CDO itself characterizes it, an unconstitutional “coercive bait-and-switch.”°2\nIt is the true and full breadth of the consequences of the due process violation that\nseparates this case from the cases relied upon by the CDO, including Stipetich.2° Each\nof those <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> involved defective or unenforceable promises that resulted in\nsuppression remedies.

Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled.

Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV.

The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4977", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page4ofl4\nCourt in Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district. Instead, the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4978", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004979.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page5ofl4\ncase focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be\nclear in the absence of a formal plea agreement. Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\nCosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI. This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “This protection\napplies both to successive punishments and to successive <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same criminal\noffense.” United States v. Dixon, 5o9 U.S. 688, 696 (l993). “A defendant may only raise a\nDouble Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime\nbefore the alleged ‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (l978); Morris v. Reynolds,\n264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the\nGovernment is free to commence a prosecution.\n\nMaxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.\nShe concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense. She was never\ncharged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She\nagreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it. She suffered no criminal\nconsequences as a result of Epstein’s guilty plea in Florida state court. To the contrary, there is\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4979", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page6ofl4\nno indication that Maxwell was even a subject of the Florida investigation. The Double Jeopardy\nClause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has\nendured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her.\n\nDespite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is\nimmune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same conspiracy. The\ncases she cites, houever, deal with successive <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of a particular defendant for the same\nconspiracy, not separate <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo4). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-\nconspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v. United States, 5o6 U.S. 534, 539\n(l993); United States v. Hinton, 543 F.2d loo2, lol4 (2d Cir. l976). Whether the Government\ncould have charged Epstein again in this case has nothing to do with Maxwell’s rights under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\nMaxwell finally points to one case in which the Second Circuit held that a subsequent\nprosecution might not be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her\nhusband pleaded guilty. Dkt. No. 293 at l9 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9\nF.2d 6o3 (2d Cir. l979)). Houever, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in\nCambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double\nJeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the\nproposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator\naccepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in\njeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo498o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page8ofl4\n\nThe Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its\nApril l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call fora\n“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULB.C, § 3299,\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgraf v. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Tn]Jotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4982", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page 7ofl7\n\n\" Ghislaine Maxwell: The Rise and Fall of Manhatan’s Most Famous Socialite\n(Nigel Cawthorne)\n\ne The Spider: Insider the Criminal Web of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\n(Barry Levin)\n\ne Jeffrey Epstein’s Other Women: Behind Ghislaine Maxwell (Lisa Tait)\n\ne The Jeffrey Epstein Case: What We Do and Don’t Knou About Jeffrey Epstein\nand Ghislaine Maxwell (Stephen Wright)\n\nMuch of the pretrial reporting, publications, and broadcasts refer to Epstein’s 2oo8 case\nin Florida and the public outrage over his charges, plea deal, the leniency he received.

OPR\nreleased a report of its investigation in November 2o2o, which again led to a series of media\narticles about Epstein’s conduct and the appropriateness of the deal he received. The effect of\nsuch recurring reporting regarding Epstein has had an incalculable spillover effect that has\nindelibly stained Ms. Maxwell and significantly impacted her ability to receive a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury.\n\nB. Allegations of Sex Abuse Abound in New York\n\nMs. Maxwell approaches trial under the cloud of massive negative publicity focused on\none of the most sensational, hot-buton social issues in recent years — sexual harassment and\nabuse of females of all ages, including inappropriate sexual contact with minors.

But these generalized\nconcerns are present in every high-profile criminal case. They do not present the rare\ncircumstances that prior courts have found justify the use of pseudonyms. Further, the alleged\nvictims that received pseudonyms during the Government’s case have a statutory right to have\ntheir “dignity and privacy” protected. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(8). The Defense’s witnesses have no\nsimilar right.\n\nPerhaps most analogous to Defendant’s request is United States v. Rainiere, United States\nv. Rainiere, No. l8-CR-2o4Sl (NGG), 2o2l WL 4522298 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2o2l), another\nhigh-profile case involving alleged sexual misconduct. There, after a defendant pled guilty, the\ndefense sought to keep leters submited in support of the defendant at sentencing anonymous,\narguing that anonymity was necessary because “the authors of supportive leters may face\nretribution if their identities are publicly knoun, given the public atention that has been paid to\nthis case” and that failure to do so “will have a chilling effect on individuals who wish to speak\nin support of defendants in other high-profile <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>.” /d. at *3-4. The court\nacknouledged the individuals’ “genuine interest in assisting sentencing while remaining out of\nthe public eye themselves,” but concluded that their leters about the defendant did “not involve\ntraditionally private maters” and that the public’s interest in access prevailed. /d. at *4. The\nCourt concludes that the same analysis applies here.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the Defense argues that without pseudonyms, its witnesses may\nrefuse to testify, implicating Ms. Maxwell’s right to present a defense. The Court notes the late-\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 26 of5l\nher motion, that these counts are “virtually identical.” (Def. Mot. at 22). But charges that cover\ndifferent schemes under different statutes are not “virtually identical.” The Court should reject\nthis argument.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the\nsame offense, a defendant has a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United States\nv. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury convicts\non more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” /d. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already been entered\non multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but one\nmultiplicitous count. Id.\n\n“For purposes of a multiplicity analysis, the determinative issue is not whether the same\nconduct underlies separate counts, but whether the offense charged in one count is the same as the\n25\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 3oof5l\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore these legal distinctions. In particular, the defendant\nurges the Court not to apply the first Korfant factor, claiming—without explanation—that this first\nfactor applies to claims arising from successive <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>, and not multiplicity claims. (Def.\nMot. at 22 n.4). But the Korfant factors are applied both when courts compare indictments in\nsuccessive <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> and when courts analyze counts in the same indictment.’ See, e.g.,\nGuzman, 7 F. App’x at 54-55 (applying the Korfant factors to a claim of multiplicity arising from\nmultiple conspiracy counts in the same indictment); United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l\n(2d Cir. 2ol3) (holding that two narcotics conspiracy counts charged in the same case were not\nmultiplicitous under the Korfant factors); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8o-8l (applying the Korfant\nfactors to a successive prosecution); Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d at 3o7 (applying the Korfant factors\nto a successive prosecution). For good reason: it would make litle sense to ignore the legal\ndistinctions between counts when determining whether those counts are different in law and fact\nfor double jeopardy purposes. See United States v. Hicks, 5 F.4th 27o, 275 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (citing\nBlockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (l932)). The defendant asks this Court to ignore the\nfirst Korfant factor because it is fatal to her multiplicity claim. The two counts are legally distinct,\nand the Court can and should reject the defendant’s multiplicity claim for this reason alone.\n7 The lone case cited by the defendant, United States v. Cooper, 886 F.3d l46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol8),\nheld that two § 37l counts in the same indictment were multiplicitous. (Def. Mot. at 22 n.4). In\nreaching that conclusion, the Court did not hold that the first Korfant factor was inapplicable to\nthat particular procedural posture. The defendant otherwise cites no case in which a court held\nthat it was inappropriate to examine the legal differences between counts when evaluating a\nmultiplicity claim.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9592", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel5of 45\nfirst explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for conspiracies to distribute marijuana were barred by double jeopardy, but then\ncontinued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further\npoint touard a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening\nand closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially\nidentical nature.” 356 F.3d at l97. The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree.

The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v.

The first states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer\n“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. l42-l at 2. The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal.

See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o773", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020786.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel68 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged.

Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v.

The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir.

The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020813.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel95 of 2o8\nCourt in Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district. Instead, the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020814.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel96 of 2o8\ncase focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be\nclear in the absence of a formal plea agreement. Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\nCosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI. This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “This protection\napplies both to successive punishments and to successive <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same criminal\noffense.” United States v. Dixon, 5o9 U.S. 688, 696 (l993). “A defendant may only raise a\nDouble Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime\nbefore the alleged ‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (l978); Morris v. Reynolds,\n264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the\nGovernment is free to commence a prosecution.\n\nMaxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.\nShe concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense. She was never\ncharged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She\nagreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it. She suffered no criminal\nconsequences as a result of Epstein’s guilty plea in Florida state court. To the contrary, there is\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020815.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel97 of 2o8\nno indication that Maxwell was even a subject of the Florida investigation. The Double Jeopardy\nClause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has\nendured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her.\n\nDespite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is\nimmune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same conspiracy. The\ncases she cites, houever, deal with successive <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of a particular defendant for the same\nconspiracy, not separate <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo4). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-\nconspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v. United States, 5o6 U.S. 534, 539\n(l993); United States v. Hinton, 543 F.2d loo2, lol4 (2d Cir. l976). Whether the Government\ncould have charged Epstein again in this case has nothing to do with Maxwell’s rights under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\nMaxwell finally points to one case in which the Second Circuit held that a subsequent\nprosecution might not be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her\nhusband pleaded guilty. Dkt. No. 293 at l9 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9\nF.2d 6o3 (2d Cir. l979)). Houever, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in\nCambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double\nJeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the\nproposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator\naccepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in\njeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020817.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel99 of 2o8\n\nThe Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its\nApril l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call for a\n“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULS.C. § 3299.\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgrafv. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Injotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020998.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel72 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l5 of 45\nfirst explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for conspiracies to distribute marijuana were barred by double jeopardy, but then\ncontinued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further\npoint touard a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening\nand closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially\nidentical nature.” 356 F.3d at l97. The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree.

The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021220.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 4G 3536o38, Page48 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 46 of 348\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.”*> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”° The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\n23 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454A XX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021225.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey as ee 3536o38, Paged3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021239.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> were fairly new, when... more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and .. . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.“\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues.

Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\n64 Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021322.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l48 3536o38, Pagel5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> that follou completed state\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\noth Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\nams Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l372", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021373.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Page2ol of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.”*° By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n288 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l373", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask.

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.” Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”> The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neo Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nad Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n23 Indictment in State v.

Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o58", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023063.jpg": "of the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023077.jpg": "I do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . .

In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts.

The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> that follou completed state\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023210.jpg": "[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span> for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\na Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023211.jpg": "depart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.74? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal <span class=\"highlight\">prosecutions</span>. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building).

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.
