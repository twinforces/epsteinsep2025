See\nShular, l4o S.Ct. at 785; Kawashima vy. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 (2ol2) (interpreting “offenses\nthat involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or\ndeceitful conduct’) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4)\n(stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to look to the elements and the\nnature of the offense . . .rather than to the particular facts” at issue); see also United States v.\nDavis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (“In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a\nstatutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.”). Thus, only if the offense “necessarily entails” the\nidentified conduct can it be said to be an “offense involving” that conduct. Kawashima, 565 U.S.\nat 484.\n\nIn United States v. Morgan, the D.C. Circuit used this approach in interpreting l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3237(a), a venue statute that applies to “[a]ny offense involving the use of the mails,\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> in interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into\nthe United States.” The court concluded that “[t]he most natural reading” of the statute is “‘to\nconstrue ‘any offense involving’ by reference to the e/ements of the offense at issue.” 393 F.3d\nl92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4) (emphasis in original). The court then gave an illustrative example of\na case in which a defendant travels in interstate commerce, commits a federal offense, and then\nreturns home via interstate commerce:\n\n[T]he circumstances surrounding the crime include [the defendant’s] travel in\n\ninterstate commerce, but his crime is not an “offense involving” <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> in\n\ninterstate commerce. In other words, a faithful reading of the precise words of the\n\nstatute in the order in which they are writen suggests that an “offense involv[es]”\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> in interstate commerce only when such <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> is an element\n\nof the offense.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002680.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of l6\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to\nStrike Surplusage from the Indictment (“Motion”).\n\nAlthough Ms. Maxwell is charged with conspiring to cause individuals to travel in\ninterstate or foreign commerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity, the indictment contains no\nallegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled.’ Moreover, throughout the period alleged in the\nindictment, Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged conduct\nas to her took place. Therefore, the Court should strike all allegations regarding Accuser-3 from\nthe indictment, as they are nothing more than a transparent atempt by the government to\nintroduce Accuser-3’s testimony as evidence of a conspiracy, when it is at most “other acts”\nevidence subject to the balancing test required by Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nCounts One through Four of the indictment allege that between l994 and l997, Ms.\nMaxwell violated and conspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act: l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 (nou § 2422(a)), which prohibits the enticement of individuals to travel in interstate or\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity, and l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2423(a), which prohibits the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of individuals under age l8 in interstate or foreign\ncommerce with the intent that they engage in unlawful sexual activity.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nRule l7 Subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write on behalf of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) with respect to Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell’s motion for an order authorizing a subpoena on BSF pursuant to Rule l7(c)(3)\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the “Subpoena”) and the Court’s March l2, 2o2l,\nSealed and Ex Parte Order requiring BSF to file a leter indicating (l) whether service on BSF can\nbe deemed adequate notice on victims whose personal or confidential information the Subpoena\nis aimed at obtaining and (2) whether the victims object to or seek modification of the Subpoena.\n\nFirst, BSF does not object to service on BSF constituting adequate notice on any victims it\nrepresents. The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice. The Order states that the Defendant identified five individuals who require notice,\nbut the Subpoena appears to seek personal and confidential information about all of the Epstein\nvictims that BSF represents, which is more than five individuals. Thus, in an abundance of caution,\nBSF will notify each of the Epstein victims it represents, unless otherwise directed by the court.\nSecond, BSF, both on its oun behalf and behalf of the women that it represents, objects to the\nSubpoena in its entirety for the follouing reasons.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Government in this case has charged the Defendant with enticing (and conspiracy to\nentice) minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of (and conspiracy to\ntransport) minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity from l994 to l997. The facts\nunderlying those charges involve three minor victims: Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-2, and\nMinor Victim-3. The Government has also charged the Defendant with two counts of perjury for\nlying under oath during a civil deposition in a defamation action brought by Virginia Giuffre when\nasked if she was aware of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme and whether she had ever given\nMinor Victim-2 a massage. BSF represents Minor Victim-2 (Annie Farmer) and Virginia Giuffre,\nbut does not represent and has never represented Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-3.\n\nDefendant has made clear since the time of her arrest that she seeks to impugn the\ncredibility of her accusers by constructing a false narrative that BSF’s cooperation with the\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl87 _ Filed o3/29/2l Pagel4 of 24\npersuade, induce, entice, and coerce an individual to travel in\ninterstate and foreign commerce to engage in sexual activity for\nwhich a person can be charged with a criminal offense, and\natempted to do the same, and aided and abeted the same, to\nwit, MAXWELL persuaded, induced, enticed, and coerced Minor :\nVictim-l to travel from Florida to New York, New York on\nmultiple occasions with the intention that Minor Victim-l would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in\nviolation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.\n\n(Title l8, United States Code, Sections 2422 and 2.)\nCOUNT THREE\n(Conspiracy to Transport Minors with Intent to\nEngage in Criminal Sexual Activity)\n\nThe Grand Jury further charges:\n\nl6.

The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice. The Order states that the Defendant identified five individuals who require notice,\nbut the Subpoena appears to seek personal and confidential information about all of the Epstein\nvictims that BSF represents, which is more than five individuals. Thus, in an abundance of caution,\nBSF will notify each of the Epstein victims it represents, unless otherwise directed by the court.\nSecond, BSF, both on its oun behalf and behalf of the women that it represents, objects to the\nSubpoena in its entirety for the follouing reasons.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Government in this case has charged the Defendant with enticing (and conspiracy to\nentice) minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of (and conspiracy to\ntransport) minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity from l994 to l997. The facts\nunderlying those charges involve three minor victims: Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-2, and\nMinor Victim-3. The Government has also charged the Defendant with two counts of perjury for\nlying under oath during a civil deposition in a defamation action brought by Virginia Giuffre when\nasked if she was aware of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme and whether she had ever given\nMinor Victim-2 a massage. BSF represents Minor Victim-2 (Annie Farmer) and Virginia Giuffre,\nbut does not represent and has never represented Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-3.\n\nDefendant has made clear since the time of her arrest that she seeks to impugn the\ncredibility of her accusers by constructing a false narrative that BSF’s cooperation with the\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2877\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 239\nbroad definition, courts have held that Section 3283 “does not require that an offense consist of a\nsexual act between a defendant and a specific child,” Vickers, 2ol4 WL l838255, at *ll, but\ninstead reaches offenses involving the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity.\nSee Sensi, 2olo WL 235l484, at *2-3 (collecting cases interpreting the term “sexual abuse” to\nencompass “all crimes that would logically relate to the common understanding of sexual abuse\neven when found in chapters llo (‘Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and ll7\n(‘<span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span> of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related Crimes’) of title l8”); Schneider, 8ol F.3d\nat l96-97 (holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant convicted of traveling with the purpose\nof engaging in sex with a minor victim, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b)); Vickers, 2ol4 WL\nl838255, at *ll-l2 (holding that violations of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) were crimes involving sexual\nabuse under Section 3283).\n\nThe defendant’s motion does not engage with these authorities at all. Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\nSuspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4). But Bridges is inapposite,\nsince it concerned a statute “[t]he legislative history of [which] emphasize[d] the propriety of its\nconservative interpretation” and “indicate[d] a purpose to suspend the general statute of limitations\nonly as to” certain narrouly defined offenses. Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l6. There is no corresponding\nindication that Congress intended the “essential ingredients” test to apply to Section 3283. As the\nThird Circuit has explained in rejecting an identical argument:\n\nWhile Bridges did adopt an “essential ingredient” test, the\nlimitations-extending statute at issue was a narrouly drafted\nexception specifically intended to target frauds related to war\nprocurement. Unlike the WSLA, § 3283 has no such restrictive\nlanguage or legislative history suggesting congressional intent to\nlimit its application to a specific subset of circumstances.

See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,\nJudge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be\ncontained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be\nequally applicable in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follous\nhere. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through\nFour is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the\ndefendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided\nthe defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided discovery regarding each\nvictim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its\nwitnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch disclosure will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future prosecutions for the\nsame offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in\nthe Indictment, is more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSecond, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in approximate terms)” of the conduct\nalleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d\nat ll3). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a\ncontinuing course of conduct involving the enticement and <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of minors with intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about l994 and in or about\nl997. See Indictment 7 l, 6, 7, 9-ll, l3, l5-l7, l9. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently\nupheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386. F.\nSupp. 3d at 369 (“[Th]le Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used to\ndescribe the windou of when a violation occurred.” (citing United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d\nl294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)); United States v.

Indeed, “[i]t is well setled that the essential elements of\nthe crime of conspiracy are: (l) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit\nan offense; (2) the defendant knouingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to\ncommit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy; and (3) that during the existence of\nthe conspiracy, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was commited by one or\nmore of the members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy.” United\nStates v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l45-46 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nBecause a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not\nmater whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements\nof the substantive crimes of <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522\nU.S. at 65. What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred. The description in the Indictment is factually accurate, houever, because Minor Victim-\n3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as traumatic,\nexploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the\njury that any consensual act commited after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent\nwas itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense\ncounsel wishes to request a particular limiting instruction or to seek authorization for a particular\nline of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the\nappropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 239\nwith the intent that they engage in illegal sex acts. In other words, Count One requires proof of an\nagreement to transport, while Count Three requires proof of an agreement to entice. <span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span>\ndoes not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily\nrequire <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span>. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2ooo WL l253265, at\n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to transport one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not\nagree to actually transport or assist in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\nconspiracy count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the\ndiscretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature.

The charged time periods are made plain in each count, as is the statute she\nis accused of violating.\n\nThe speaking Indictment in this case goes above and beyond a mere recitation of the\nelements of each offense by detailing the defendant’s specific role in the crimes charged. Among\nother things, it specifies three minor victims in particular and describes the steps the defendant\ntook with respect to each as part of the charged crimes. See, e.g., Indictment 4/7. Additionally,\nthe Indictment details the types of sex acts that Epstein commited with the minor victims as part\nof the charged crimes and the locations where those acts occurred. See, e.g., id. § 5-6. In this way,\nthe Indictment makes clear the Government’s theory that the defendant groomed three minor girls\nto engage in sex acts in Florida, New Mexico, New York, and London with Epstein between l994\nand l997. The Indictment further specifies during which portion of that period each of those three\nvictims interacted with the defendant and Epstein as minors. See id. §7. Additionally, the\nIndictment identifies the precise answers that the Government alleges constituted perjury, and\nalleges facts, in the earlier portions of the Indictment, that indicate hou and why the Government\nwill seek to prove the answers were false. Compare id. JJ 2l, 23 with id. 9§ l-ll. Simply put,\nthis is not a case in which the allegations in the Indictment “are so general that they do not advise\nthe defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.” Walsh, l94 F.3d at 47 (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234). Thus, the Indictment itself provides a sufficient\nbasis to deny the defendant’s motion in its entirety. See, e.g., United States v. Bonventre, 646 F\nApp’x 73, 79 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (“‘[E]videntiary detail is not the function of the bill of particulars.’\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 22\nno dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for\nlive charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.’\nRather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute\nare such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that\nCongress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a conclusion here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 22\noutside the sentencing and immigration context in which the “necessarily entails” approach has\nbeen rejected, it fails to offer any.” Nor does the government respond to the case law cited by\nMs. Maxwell in which courts have interpreted “offense involving” language in a venue statute,\nwhich has nothing to do with sentencing, immigration, or prior convictions, to refer to the\nelements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4)\n(“The most natural reading of § 3237(a) 4 2 is to construe ‘any offense involving’ by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue.”) (emphasis in original); United States v.

Ala. 2oll) (“The Eleventh Circuit has employed the second paragraph of\nSection 3237(a) when such <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span>, or use of the mails, is an element of the offense\ncharged.”). The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the “necessarily entails”\napproach simply do not exist.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2oo9)—the only\nSupreme Court case the government cites in which the Court applied a fact-based approach to an\n“offense involving” statute—does not break this line of cases at all. In Nijhawan, the statutory\nprovision at issue referred to “an offense that .. . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\nvictim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo.” 557 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § llol(a)(43)(M)(i))\n(emphasis added by Court). The issue before the Court was not whether the statute required\n“fraud or deceit” to be an element of the underlying offense, but whether the referenced\nmonetary threshold was required to be an element. The Court held that it was not, reasoning that\n“Tt]he words ‘in which’ (which modify ‘offense’) can refer to the conduct involved ‘in’ the\n” According to the government, the ostensible rationale for the “necessarily entails” approach—avoiding the need\nfor courts to examine the facts of prior convictions—is not present in the § 3283 context. But a fact-based approach\nposes a different practical obstacle in the statute of limitations context. Under a fact-based approach here, for\nexample, in order to obtain the benefit of the expanded limitations period, the government would be required to\nprove conduct (i.e., sexual abuse) that is not an element of an offense; a jury would be required to find not only that\nMs. Maxwell commited the offenses with which she is charged but also that her offenses “involve[] . . . the sexual\nor physical abuse .. . of a child”; and only after the jury has returned its verdict would it be knoun which statute of\nlimitations—§ 3283 or the default provision under § 3282—applies to this prosecution.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003672.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 22\nage—to travel with the requisite intent. l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a). Section 2423(a) requires only the\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of a child with the requisite intent, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a); it does not necessarily\nentail “the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to do\nanything other than travel. Ifa defendant entices an adult to travel for the purpose of engaging in\nunlawful sexual activity, a § 2422(a) offense has been commited, but no sexual abuse of a child\nhas occurred. If a defendant transports a minor with the intent (unbeknounst to the minor) that\nthe minor will engage in sexual activity, no sexual activity occurs, and there is no “employment,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion” to engage in sexual activity, a § 2423(a)\noffense has been commited, but no sexual abuse of a child has occurred.\n\nWhile the government cites several cases in which courts have found § 3283 applicable to\nparticular statutes, it cites only one case in which either a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense has\nbeen held to involve “sexual abuse” within the meaning of § 3283.

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3,\nAdvisory Commitee Notes, l972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks\ninducing a decision based on a purely emotional basis).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\n\nUnder the Federal Rules, relevant evidence is generally admissible while irrelevant\nevidence is categorically inadmissible. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o2. Evidence is relevant if it tends to\nmake a fact of consequence to the action more or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. In turn, relevant evidence must be excluded when its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\nmisleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nHere, testimony that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) is irrelevant\nto the charged offenses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped anyone. And Accuser-l has never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or participated in\nan alleged rape. Because the conspiracy charged in the indictment is limited to enticement and\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of minors across state lines to provide Mr. Epstein with sexualized massages, there\nis no argument that Accuser-l’s rape allegation is relevant to the charged conspiracy. It (and any\nother allegation of rape by anyone else) therefore must be excluded. Fed. R. Evid. 4o2.\n\nEven if a rape allegation had some relevance, Rule 4o3 would still require its exclusion\nbecause the minimal probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Evidence is\nunfairly prejudicial when it has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl8o (l997).\n\nHere, any allegation that Mr. Epstein raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will suggest to the\njury that it should convict Ms. Maxwell based on Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct and not the\noffenses with which she has been charged. Admission of this evidence poses a serious risk that\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o3 Filed ll/o2/2l Page3of4\nPage 3\n\n(Monday, October ll was a federal holiday); the package scheduled for delivery on October l4,\n2o2l was delivered to the defendant on October l5, 2o2l; the package scheduled for delivery on\nSaturday, October l6, 2o2l was delivered to the defendant on Monday, October l8, 2o2l; and the\npackage scheduled for delivery on October 28, 2o2l was delivered on October 29, 2o2l.

Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC.

See Elbert, 56l F.3d at 777-78\n(affirming exclusion of evidence of a victim’s consent under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2). In\nthe absence of a consent defense, evidence about the victims’ consent to sexual activity should\nalso be excluded as irrelevant. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.

Evidence of this sort may well be irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.

But the harms to the business would be directly and proximately\ncaused by actions taken in furtherance of the scheme, qualifying the business as a victim. So too\nhere.\n\nIt is no answer to say, as the defense has argued, that Epstein’s conduct with respect to\nMinor Victim-3 was legal. For the purposes of seting forth the elements of the charged crime, the\nCourt must of course draw a clear line at the age of consent.” But the definition in the CVRA and\nVWPA “‘is certainly broad,” Batista, 575 F.3d at 23l, and is broader than the elements of the\noffense. Thus, in assessing whether Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under these definitions—and in\nassessing the admissibility of her testimony—such a clear line is neither required nor proper.\nEpstein and the defendant were not checking victims’ identifications at the door to ensure they\nwere above the age of consent in whichever location they were at the time. Just as Epstein’s\nprurient interest in girls did not switch off at midnight of their l7\" birthday, neither did it toggle\non and off as his plane crossed into jurisdictions with different ages of consent. Rather, Epstein\nand the defendant were engaged in a wide-ranging conspiracy to recruit girls for sexual abuse in\nmultiple jurisdictions with differing ages of consent. The core of the conspiracy was the agreement\nto engage in the criminal conduct, and it does not mater whether the elements of the substantive\ncrimes of <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> or enticement were completed or atempted to be completed as to Minor\nVictim-3. See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997). That is why Epstein’s abuse of\nMinor Victim-3 is properly included in the indictment and why Epstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-\n3’s testimony is direct evidence of the conspiracy. If Minor Victim-3 was directly and proximately\n* It bears noting that the Mann Act contemplates that children under the age of l8 are victims of\nthe offense, though in this case that is limited by the New York object charged in the Indictment.\nSee, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (criminalizing the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of an individual “who has not\natained the age of l8” for purposes of illegal sexual activity).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7434\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l7 of 375\n\nPi Mu Epsilon, National Mathematics Honorary, elected l965\n\nMortar Board, National Senior Women’s Honorary, elected l965\n\nElected, Golden Key International Honour Society, honorary member, 2oo5\n\nFellouships\n\nOffice of Education Traineeship, Stanford University, l966-69\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health Fellouship, Stanford University, l969-7o\n\nAmerican Council on Education Fellouship in Academic Administration, Harvard University, l975-76\n\nFellou, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, l978-79\n\nGrants, Contracts, Research Funding\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, l97l-72; l972-73; l976-79 (Human Memory)\n\nU.S. Department of <span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span>, l974-76 (Human Memory)\n\nGeneral Services Administration, l974-75 (Communications--w/Keating)\n\nNational Bureau of Standards, l976-77; l98o-82 (Communications--w/Keating)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l978-85 (Human Memory)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l98o-83 (Jury Behavior--w/Severance)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l983-85; (Hypnosis--w/Greene)\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, l984-86; l986-89;l989-92 (Memory)\n\nNational Center for Health Services Research, l986-88 (Survey Memory)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l986-88; l988-9l (Jury Comprehension--w/Greene-Goodman)\n\nFund for Research on Dispute Resolution, l989-9l (Predictions of Success--w/Goodman)\n\nNational Institute of Health, l99l-95 (Cognition & Health--w/Croyle)\n\nNational Institute of Health, l993-94 (Health/sex memory: subcontract from UCSF/Catania)\n\nLeverhulme Trust, Postevent info and erasing memories, l997-l999 (w/ Dan Wright, Univ. of Bristol)\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh, Travel Grant, 2oo6\n\nGrawemeyer Award Funding given to UCI, 2oo5-present.\n\nNewkirk Center for Science & Society, 2ol7-2ol9.\n\nAwards & Honors\n\nNational Lecturer of Sigma Xi, l978-8o\n\nAmerican Psychological Association nomination for the NSF Waterman Award for Outstanding\nContributions to Science, l977 and l978\n\nNational Media Award for Eyewitness Testimony (American Psychological Foundation, Distinguished\nContribution, l98o)\n\nGreyhound Research Award, l987-88\n\nHonorary Fellou, British Psychological Society, l99l (includes lifetime membership)\n\nGeorge E.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to request that the Court give the jury additional\ninstructions to correct apparent errors in the jury’s understanding of Counts Two and Four, and the\nlaw applicable to those counts, that were highlighted by the jury’s note this afternoon (Court\nExhibit #l5).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 reads, in relevant part, as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), [i]f the defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nCount Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported from Florida\nto New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would engage in one\nor more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” S2\nInd. § 2l (emphasis added).\n\nIn response to the note, the Court referred the jury to Instruction No. 2l of the jury charge.\nThe defense believes that the Court’s response was erroneous for two reasons.\n\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo879o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document566- Filed l2/28/2l Page3of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” /d. at 2o (cleaned up).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction on the substantive\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New\nMexico and sexual activity that purportedly took place while she was there. That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” S2 Ind. § 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008892.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document593 _ Filed o2/o4/22 Page 3o of 3o\nCOUNT FOUR: <span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span> of an Individual Under the Age of l7 (Jane only) with |\nIntent to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity\nGuilty Not Guilty\nCOUNT FIVE: Conspiracy to Commit Sex Trafficking of Individuals Under the Age |\nof l8 |\nGuilty J Not Guilty |\nCOUNT SIX: Sex Trafficking of an Individual Under the Age of l8 (Carolyn only) |\nGuilty “a Not Guilty |\n#26 bey far 4 Vy) pal |\nJuror Number of Foreperson Date and Time\n.\n$\n|\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008935.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Pagell of 37\n\nMR.

The Jury Note read as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\nCourt Exhibit #l5 (Dkt. 593 at 23). The defense argued that the Note indicated that the jury was\nalready contemplating convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse in New Mexico, which was not a violation of New York law, and that their question\nfocused on whether Ms. Maxwell’s help planning Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nassuming they found she gave any, was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\nTr. 3l28:6-3l4o:l8.

Ind. § 2l. The “to wit” clause of Count Four specified that the\nunderaged individual was Jane, the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> in interstate commerce was Jane’s travel “from\nFlorida to New York, New York,” and the illegal sexual activity was a violation of New York\nPenal Law, Section l3o.55.

Tr.\n3l7:2-32l:5. But Jane did recall one trip to New Mexico when she was “l5 or l6.” Tr. 32l:6-\n32l:l3. Jane testified that she flew to New Mexico with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and stayed at\nEpstein’s ranch. Tr. 32l:l4-322:6. She further testified that, at some point while she was there,\nsomeone came to her room and escorted her to Epstein’s room where she was sexually abused.\nTr. 322:7-323:l9.\n\nBased on this testimony and the text of the Jury Note, there is a substantial likelihood that\nthe jury did not convict Ms. Maxwell based on Jane’s testimony about the New York trips, and\ninstead improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in\nNew Mexico. According to the Jury Note, the jurors had the mistaken impression that it would\nbe sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had\nintended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, even though such conduct was not and\ncould not have been “sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55”:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8942\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2o of 37\nNew Mexico trip to see if it supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question\nposed by the Jury Note.\n\nThis is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Ms. Maxwell on the substantive\nenticement offense (Count Two). The jury likely determined that the only corroborating\nevidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced”\nJane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did not testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell\nprior to the flight to New Mexico in which they discussed the trip. Hence, the acquital on Count\nTwo. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if they found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in\narranging Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place,\nthey could convict her on the substantive <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four. Hence, the\nquestion in the Jury Note.\n\nRegardless, it is clear from the Jury Note that the jurors were deliberating with a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law — namely, that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of\nCount Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in\nNew Mexico, without finding any intent to violate New York law. The Court’s response to refer\nthe jurors to the existing instructions was insufficient because the jury charge, which had been\nstripped of any mention of “travel to New York,” did not adequately instruct the jury that a\nconviction on Count Four could not be based solely on sexual abuse in New Mexico or any other\njurisdiction outside of New York. It was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for conviction under Count\nFour.

The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 22 of 5l\ndid not modify any essential element of the offense or permit conviction based on an entirely\ndifferent theory. Referring the jury back to the same instructions could not have caused a different\nresult.\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged the defendant with Mann Act offenses with an intent to engage\nin sexual activity in violation of a New York statute. The Government put on evidence that the\ndefendant engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to violate that New York statute. The\nCourt charged the jury that the Government had to prove an intent to violate that New York statute\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. “[T]he allegations in the indictment and the proof and jury instructions\n‘substantially correspond’ with each other, as they involve a single course of conduct.” D’Amelio,\n683 F.3d at 424. “It therefore follous that [the defendant] was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment, and there was no constructive amendment of the\nindictment.” Jd.>\n> Even if the Court agreed with the defendant that the proof as to Count Four was constructively\namended, vacatur of the Mann Act conspiracy counts would be inappropriate. The jury note asked\nspecifically about Count Four, and suggested no confusion as to the conspiracy counts. Moreover,\nthe jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the\njury was focused on Annie Farmer’s testimony as to the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Tr. 3lo2-\no7). And Annie’s testimony of abuse in New Mexico is no less significant than Jane’s. Finally, it\nis entirely unclear hou the jury’s erroneous understanding of the law relating to a substantive\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> offense could prejudice the jury’s understanding for the enticement conspiracy\ncharge. See United States v. Pfaff, 4o7 F. App’x 5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. 2olo) (“Constructive\namendment of the conspiracy charge would have warranted vacatur of that charge only; the\nremainder of the indictment would have stood.”); United States v. Milstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 66 (2d\nCir. 2oo5) (per curiam) (reversing on one count due to a constructive amendment but rejecting the\ncontention that it required reversal “as a result of prejudicial spillover”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 29of5l\n\nHere, not only are Counts Three and Five predicated on different statutes, but the legal\ndistinctions between these counts are substantial. First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span>,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a passenger\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth certificate\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 49of5l\n2o8o-84 (shopping with Annie in New Mexico and teaching her to massage Epstein’s feet), 84o-\n45 (recruiting Virginia and instructing Alessi to bring her to Epstein’s Florida house), l524\n(Virginia receiving money for sex with Epstein), l534 (inviting Carolyn to travel)). The jury\nevidently credited this testimony, and based on that testimony and the reasonable inferences from\nit, a rational jury easily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.\n\nThe defendant has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on\nthe remaining counts, and for good reason. Just as the conspiracies in Counts One and Three are\nmultiplicitous because enticement and <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> are dual aims of the same conspiracy, see\nsupra Part III, Count Three is amply supported by the evidence underlying Count One. As to\nCount Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,\nincluding the specific incident in which Jane had difficulty returning from New York to Palm\nBeach, and that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private plane. (Tr. 2268-69; see Tr.\n3l6-l7 (testimony that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private jet and would “assist”\nin “making travel arrangements”); Tr. 323-24 (“[S]ometimes it would be — Jeffrey would ask her,\nhey, can you get Jane, you knou, tickets and the times and whatnot and make the arrangements to\nbe picked up.”). That, in combination with evidence of the defendant’s participation in Jane’s\nabuse in New York, is sufficient on its oun for the jury to convict on Count Four. See United\nStates v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 336 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“The record is replete with evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could infer that sexual access to Jaire was a dominant purpose of Vargas-\nCordon’s repeated transport of her from his New Jersey home into Brooklyn.”); United States v.\nMi Sun Cho, 7l3 F.3d 7l6, 72o (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“Cho does not dispute that one who arranges\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 5oof5l\nanother’s <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> across state lines for purposes of prostitution violates § 242l”); United\nStates v.

But the jury could also have\nconvicted the defendant by concluding that Epstein transported Jane, as he undoubtedly did by\ntransporting her on his private jet, and that the defendant aided and abeted that <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> by\ngrooming Jane, accompanying her on the plane, and participating in the abuse once she arrived in\nNew York.\n\nFinally, the record contains ample evidence for the jury to convict on Counts Five and Six.\nCarolyn’s testimony, corroborated by testimony from Shawn and physical evidence including\nmessage pads, shoued that the defendant knew that Carolyn was a minor and made phone calls to\narrange for Carolyn to engage in sex acts with Epstein in exchange for money. That is sufficient\nfor Count Six. And the evidence shoued that the defendant conspired with Epstein to traffic\nCarolyn and other minors for sex, including evidence that the defendant personally recruited\nVirginia while she was a minor. That is sufficient for Count Five.\n\nThe defense at trial focused largely on the credibility of the victims who testified against\nthe defendant. Nou that the jury has convicted on five counts, and in a posture in which the Court\nmust defer to the jury’s evaluation of the witnesses and take all inferences in favor of the\nGovernment, those arguments are not availing. The evidence at trial is more than sufficient to\nsustain the jury’s verdict.\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009666.jpg": "Cc :2o-cr- \" :\nase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 638 _ Filed o3/o9/22 Page 5 of 29\n|\n) Juror ID: 6o _ |\nSe Do you have any personal commitments that would make it difficult for you to get |\nto court by 9:3o a.m., every day of trial, or remain at the courthouse until 5:oo p.m.?

See\nUnited States v.

(Tr. 3l26-4o). In fact, the text of the Jury\nNote is straightforward and indicates on its face that the jurors had an incorrect understanding of\nthe intent requirement for Count Four that needed to be clarified with a supplemental instruction.\nThe Note reads:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\n(Court Exhibit #l5). Stated slightly differently, but using the same words that the jurors\nthemselves used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the follouing:\n' The government contends that this argument is “beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to the jury\nnote or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment argument.” (Opp. at 2o). It is\nnot clear to the defense hou these arguments differ in any material respect from the one we are advancing. For the\nsake of clarity, we are claiming that the Court’s response to the Jury Note was erroneous and resulted in a\nconstructive amendment/variance.\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8of24\nUnder the second element of Count Four, can the defendant be found guilty if the\ndefendant’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico and if\nthe defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nbut not the flight to New Mexico?\n\nHence, the question posed by the Jury Note contained two parts. The jury wanted to knou if it\nwas sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if it found (l) that Ms. Maxwell’s\nintent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and (2) that Ms. Maxwell\nassisted with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. That is\nthe straightforward, common sense reading of the Jury Note.\n\nThe answer to the first part of the jury’s question is an unequivocal no. The jury\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four charged that the government had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law.” (Instr. No. 2l (emphasis added)). It was\ntherefore not sufficient to satisfy this element if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. Any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico could not, by definition, be a violation of New York law.\n\nAccordingly, the Jury Note revealed that the jury had a fundamental misunderstanding of\nthe intent requirement under Count Four. The jury needed to be given a supplemental instruction\nclarifying that to convict under Count Four, they needed to find that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New York and that any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico, while it was potentially relevant evidence, could not have violated New York law. The\nCourt’s decision to simply refer the jury to the existing jury instruction for the second element of\nCount Four did nothing to cure the misunderstanding because the jury already had those\ninstructions and was still evidently confused about the proof necessary to satisfy Count Four.

The\nCourt should therefore enter judgment only on Count Three.°\n\nA. The Criminal Offenses Charged\nThe government argues that the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three\nand Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.° Count Five is not a\ndistinct conspiracy simply because it alleged a different statutory object than Count Three, as the\ngovernment claims. (Opp. at 27). If that were the case, the government would never have\nconceded that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different\nstatutory objects. Count One alleged a conspiracy to violate the enticement statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2422), while Count Three alleged a conspiracy to violate the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). (Ind. 99 ll-l2, l7-l8). Moreover, each of these statutory objects has different\nelements. For example, enticement does not require actual travel in interstate commerce,\nwhereas <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> does. (Compare Instr. l4 with Instr. l9). Enticement requires persuasion\nor inducement to travel, whereas <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> does not. U/d.) <span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span> (in this case)\nrequires that the defendant knou that the individual transported was under the age of seventeen,\nwhereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal distinctions are no less significant than the\ndistinctions between Count Three and Count Five that were highlighted by the government —\ne.g., the age of consent was seventeen for Count Three and eighteen for Count Five, and Count\n> As discussed further belou, the conspiracy charged in Count Five is a smaller subset of the larger conspiracy\ncharged in Count Three. The Court should therefore enter judgment on Count Three.\n6 The government suggests that the defense deliberately asked the Court to ignore this factor to avoid the Court’s\nconsideration of it. That is absolutely incorrect. The first Korfant factor, as set forth in the Korfant case itself, is\n“the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments.” Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662 (emphasis added). Hence, it\nwas not evident that this factor applied in cases where the multiplicitous counts were in the same indictment. The\ndefense accepts that the Second Circuit has applied this factor in such cases and the Court may consider it here. See\nUnited States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool). But this factor is by no means fatal to the defense’s\nmultiplicity argument.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page3of 45\nDefendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as\nthe Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually\nabuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense with multiple victims. Because the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts. This\nlegal conclusion in no way calls into question the factual findings made by the jury. Rather, it\nunderscores that the jury unanimously found—three times over—that the Defendant is guilty of\nconspiring with Epstein to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse.\n\nI. The Court grants the Defendant’s multiplicity claim.\n\nThe Defendant was indicted on six counts: (l) conspiracy to entice individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; (2) enticement of individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2; (3)\nconspiracy to transport individuals under the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce\nwith intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 37l; (4) <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to engage in\nsexual activity illegal under New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8\nUS.C. §§ 2423(a), 2; (5) conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of individuals under the age of\neighteen, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; and (6) sex trafficking of an individual under the age of\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel7 of 45\nFollouing the close of the defense case, the Defendant renewed her previous Rule 29\napplication. /d. at 2736.\n\nIn her brief, the Defendant reiterates her request that the Court “enter a judgment of\nacquital as to all counts.” Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 24 of 45\njustice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a). Such a motion is granted “sparingly and in the most\nextraordinary circumstances, and only in order to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.”\nUnited States v. Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D ’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n* The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo39o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 29 of 45\nalter the fact that the evidence and instructions at trial captured the core of criminality of the\nIndictment.\n\nThe jury note at issue read:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s return flight,\n\nbut not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual\n\nactivity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\nCourt Ex. l5, Dkt. No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\ninstruction. Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on commercial carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel5 of 29\n\nA, Ms. Maxwell Does Not Present a Continuing Danger to the Public.\n\nIt is clear from the Guidelines commentary and the Congressional intent underlying the\ncreation of § 4Bl.5 that the adjustment does not apply to Ms. Maxwell. The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator.... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly\nhigh — released rapists are lo times more likely to repeat their crime than other\ncriminals. The Congress has a responsibility to address the issue by passing a\nbill that would put an end to this cycle of violence repeated by a single\nperpetrator.” Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of l998,\nHearing Before the House Judiciary Commitee, Subcommitee on Crime, lo5\"\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 29\nthat she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or\nCarolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010763.jpg": ": Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page lo of 353 ,\nJuror ID: g\n5.

So there has to be -- the object of this\n\nl4 conspiracy is a violation of New York law. With respect to\n\nl5 Kate, there was no violation of New York law. Your Honor\n\nl6 already instructed the jury that they can't consider that\n\nl7 evidence for purposes of conviction because she was above the\nl8 age of consent. There was no violation of New York law.

So the\n7 only evidence we have that goes to -- that actually establishes\n8 a violation of New York law, which is the object of this\n\n9 conspiracy, and the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> conspiracy, is\nlo what Jane said.\nll Nou the Court did instruct the jury that they can\nl2 consider the testimony of Kate and of Annie for whatever\nl3 relevant purpose they see fit, and I suppose that could be\nl4 evidence of a conspiracy, correct, but for them to actually\nl5 convict on this, they have to believe that somebody commited a\nl6 violation of New York law, and that relates solely to Jane, and\nl7 so we don't think -- there are no multiple alleged victims of\nl8 this conspiracy other than Jane that's been established by the\nl9 evidence at trial.

Ms. Maxwell must have\n2o knouingly transported or caused the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane in\n2l interstate commerce.

But I think when we\n22 are parsing commas this finely in a note that is unclear, it's\n23 unclear which clauses are modifying which clauses, or which\n24 flights we're even talking about, I think it's far too\n25 confusing to give simple answers here.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool47o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 29 3l39\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl which is the substantive <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> count, which, as we\n\n2 knou, has to deal with the violation of New York law.

But with respect to the government's theory of the\nlo conspiracy and of the substantive counts, enticement and\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span>, so Counts One through Four, is that the\n\nl2 underlying object was a violation of New York law, right,\n\nl3 Section l3o.55. So there has to be -- the object of this\n\nl4 conspiracy is a violation of New York law. With respect to\n\nl5 Kate, there was no violation of New York law. Your Honor\n\nl6 already instructed the jury that they can't consider that\n\nl7 evidence for purposes of conviction because she was above the\nl8 age of consent. There was no violation of New York law. Same\nl9 thing with —-\n2o THE COURT: Well, just to be slightly more precise,\nal they can't convict on that count based solely on the evidence\n22 of the conduct involving her.\n23 MR. EVERDELL: Correct. And with respect to Annie,\n24 the Court also instructed that this is -- whatever conduct they\n25 may find that she talked about in New Mexico, was not illegal\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6934\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016935.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9 of 95 2747\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl sexual activity as charged in the indictment, which is a\n\n2 reference to the violation of New York law, because that is the\n3 theory we're proceeding under.\n\n4 With respect to Carolyn, there was no limiting\n\n5 instruction, but it's evident we were talking about Florida\n\n6 conduct. There is no violation of New York law there. So the\n7 only evidence we have that goes to -- that actually establishes\n8 a violation of New York law, which is the object of this\n\n9 conspiracy, and the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> conspiracy, is\nlo what Jane said.\nll Nou the Court did instruct the jury that they can\nl2 consider the testimony of Kate and of Annie for whatever\nl3 relevant purpose they see fit, and I suppose that could be\nl4 evidence of a conspiracy, correct, but for them to actually\nl5 convict on this, they have to believe that somebody commited a\nl6 violation of New York law, and that relates solely to Jane, and\nl7 so we don't think -- there are no multiple alleged victims of\nl8 this conspiracy other than Jane that's been established by the\nl9 evidence at trial. So we believe while they may be able to\n2o consider the testimony of Annie and Kate as evidence of some\n2l sort of relevant evidence that speaks to this conspiracy, that\n22 is not -- they are not victims of this conspiracy, there was no\n23 violation of New York law that they testified to, and that is\n24 Jane alone.

Ms. Maxwell must have\n2o knouingly transported or caused the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane in\n2l interstate commerce. That means that the government must prove\n22 that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be\n23 transported and that Jane was being transported in interstate\n24 commerce.

The\n5 only evidence we have of a flight to New Mexico with Jane is\n\n6 the one in the flight logs, and it is a flight to New Mexico.\n\n7 And so the return flight would be some other flight besides the\n8 flight to New Mexico.\n\n9 She is also alleged that -- and to be honest, I think\nlo it was a litle unclear what may have happened in New Mexico\n\nll based on her testimony; but if there was any illegal sexual\n\nl2 conduct, the flight to New Mexico, this is what they are\n\nl3 debating, because they say, but not the flight to New Mexico,\nl4 where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity.\nl5 Okay. So it seems that the jury is deliberating or at\nl6 least trying to decide whether the flight to New Mexico was for\nl7 the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

It also included two counts of perjury\nin connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July\nl2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl\nsuperseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully\nbriefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\na sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of\nMaxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress\nevidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal\nexclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to\nthe newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell's motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants\nher motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by\nApril 2l, 2o2l why her motion to dismiss the $l superseding indictment under the Sixth\nAmendment (Dkt. No. l25) should not be denied as moot.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nIn June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell\nwith facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor victims from around\nl994 to l997. The Government filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter,\nwhich contained only small, ministerial corrections. The $l superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of\nthe Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two\ncounts of perjury in connection with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to\nbegin on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nMaxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding\nindictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those\nmotions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking\ncount and another related conspiracy count.\n\nThis Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently pending pretrial motions other than\nthose seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and\nthis Opinion, deal exclusively with the $l superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o76o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020825.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2o7 of 2o8\n3o35\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl that the intended acts were nonconsensual solely because of the\n2 victim's age, you must find that Ms. Maxwell knew that Jane was\n3 less than l7 years old.\n\n4 Instruction No. l8.

Count Four. <span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span> of an\nl5 individual under the age of l7 to engage in illegal sexual\n\nl6 activity. The elements.\n\nl7 In order to prove the defendant guilty of Count Four,\nl8 the government must establish each of the follouing three\n\nl9 elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt:\n2o First, that the defendant knouingly transported an\n2l individual in interstate commerce as alleged in the indictment.\n22 Second, that the defendant transported the individual\n23 with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual\n24 activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\n25 offense under New York law as alleged in the indictment.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020826.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2o8 of 2o8\n3o36\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl And third, that the defendant knew that the individual\n2 was less than l7 years old at the time of the acts alleged in\n\n3 Count Four of the indictment.

Count Four. <span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span> of an\n6 individual under the age of l7 to engage in illegal sexual\n\n7 activity. First element.\n\n8 The first element of Count Four which the government\n\n9 must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell\n\nlo knouingly transported Jane in interstate commerce as alleged in\nll the indictment. The phrase \"to transport an individual in\n\nl2 interstate commerce\" means to move or carry or cause someone to\nl3 be moved or carried from one state to another.\n\nl4 The government does not have to prove that Ms. Maxwell\nl5 personally transported Jane across a state line; it is\n\nl6 sufficient to satisfy the element that Ms. Maxwell was actively\nl7 engaged, either personally or through an agent, in the making\nl8 of the travel arrangements such as by purchasing tickets\n\nl9 necessary for Jane to travel as planned. Ms. Maxwell must have\n2o knouingly transported or caused the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane in\n2l interstate commerce. That means that the government must prove\n22 that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be\n23 transported and that Jane was being transported in interstate\n24 commerce. As I've explained, an act is done knouingly when\n25 it's done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020831.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 98,_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Paged of 22l\n3o37\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl accident, mistake, or some innocent reason.\n\n2 It is the defendant's intent that maters here.

I've already instructed you regarding that crime, and\n2o those instructions apply equally here.\n2l In order to establish this element, it's not necessary\n22 for the government to prove that the illegal sexual activity\n23 was Ms. Maxwell's sole purpose for transporting Jane across\n24 state lines. A person may have several different purposes or\n25 motives for such conduct, and each may prompt in varying degree\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o83l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020832.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 98,_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page6 of 22l\n3o38\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl the person's actions.\n\n2 The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\n3 houever, that a significant or motivating purpose of Jane's\n\n4 travel across state lines was that she would engage in illegal\ni) sexual activity; in other words, the illegal sexual activity\n\n6 must not have been merely incidental to the trip.\n\n7 Instruction No. 22.

The\n2) only evidence we have of a flight to New Mexico with Jane is\n\n6 the one in the flight logs, and it is a flight to New Mexico.\n\n7 And so the return flight would be some other flight besides the\n8 flight to New Mexico.\n\n9 She is also alleged that -- and to be honest, I think\nlo it was a litle unclear what may have happened in New Mexico\n\nll based on her testimony; but if there was any illegal sexual\n\nl2 conduct, the flight to New Mexico, this is what they are\n\nl3 debating, because they say, but not the flight to New Mexico,\nl4 where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity.\nl5 Okay.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to request that the Court give the jury additional\ninstructions to correct apparent errors in the jury’s understanding of Counts Two and Four, and the\nlaw applicable to those counts, that were highlighted by the jury’s note this afternoon (Court\nExhibit #l5).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 reads, in relevant part, as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), [l]f the defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nCount Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported from Florida\nto New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would engage in one\nor more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” S82\nInd. ¥ 2l (emphasis added).\n\nIn response to the note, the Court referred the jury to Instruction No. 2l of the jury charge.\nThe defense believes that the Court’s response was erroneous for two reasons.\n\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020851.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page25 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 3 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” Jd. at 2o (cleaned up).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction on the substantive\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New\nMexico and sexual activity that purportedly took place while she was there. That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported.\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” $2 Ind. | 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o85l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020919.jpg": "Case 22- Q 2\nl426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page93 of 22l\nA-293\nCc -2o-cr- 7 F\nase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 638 Filed o3/o9/22 Page 5 of 29\ni\n|\n; Juror ID: 5o |\n5, Do you have any personal commitments that would make it difficult for you to get |\nto court by 9:3o a.m., every day of trial, or remain at the courthouse until 5:oo p.m.? i\n(Please note, the Court.will arrange and provide <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> to and from the |\nCourthouse each day for’ selected jurors). |\na Yes YA No .\n5a.

The overarching conspiracy—which, as\nthe Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually\nabuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense with multiple victims. Because the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts.

The Court grants the Defendant’s multiplicity claim.\n\nThe Defendant was indicted on six counts: (l) conspiracy to entice individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; (2) enticement of individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2; (3)\nconspiracy to transport individuals under the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce\nwith intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 37l; (4) <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to engage in\nsexual activity illegal under New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8\nU.S.C. §§ 2423(a), 2; (5) conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of individuals under the age of\neighteen, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; and (6) sex trafficking of an individual under the age of\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o986\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021000.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel74 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l7 of 45\nFollouing the close of the defense case, the Defendant renewed her previous Rule 29\napplication. /d. at 2736.\n\nIn her brief, the Defendant reiterates her request that the Court “enter a judgment of\nacquital as to all counts.” Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2looo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021007.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel8l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 24 of 45\njustice so requires.” Fed.

Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n4 The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same.

No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\ninstruction. Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on commercial carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021063.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Pagel6 of ll3\nSTATEMENT OF SUBJECT MATTER\nAND APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nThis is an appeal from a final judgment of the District Court (Alison Julie\nNathan and a jury), rendered on June 28, 2o22, convicting Defendant-Appellant\nGhislaine Maxwell (“Defendant”) of Conspiracy to Transport Minors with Intent\nto Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity in violation of Title l8 U.S.C. §37l;\n<span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span> of a Minor with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity in\nviolation of Title l8 U.S.C. §2423(a); and Sex Trafficking of a Minor in violation\nof Title l8 U.S.C. §l59l(a), (b) (2 ), and §2.

But by its text, § 3283 applies only to\n“offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. <span class=\"highlight\">Transportation</span> of a minor or conspiracy to transport in violation of\n§ 2423(a) is not such an offense, so Counts Three and Four must be dismissed.\n\nAt first blush, it may seem counterintuitive to assert that Counts Three and\nFour do not allege “offense[s] involving the sexual ... abuse ... of a child.” But\nlongstanding legal precedent dictates a narrouer application of § 3283. The\nSupreme Court has frequently adopted a “categorical approach” (or “essential\ningredient” test) when interpreting a statute’s references to other offenses or\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021136.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page89 of ll3\nconspiracies (Counts One and Three). There is a substantial likelihood that the\njury believed that sexual activity that violated New York Penal Law §l3o.55\nneed not have occurred in New York and that Maxwell was convicted of Count\nFour based on Jane’s testimony about sexual activity with Epstein at his ranch\nin New Mexico.\n\nJane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury\nwith an alternative basis for conviction that was entirely distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment.

Accordingly, this Court should vacate\nMaxwell’s convictions on Counts Three and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nA. Background Facts\n\nl. The Jury Note\n\nDuring their deliberations, the jury sent a note (the “Jury Note” or the\n“Note’”) inquiring about the proper basis to convict under Count Four of the\nIndictment (the substantive <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> count). The Jury Note read as\nfollous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span>\n\nof Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if\n\nthe intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be\n\nfound guilty under the second element?\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021138.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page9l of ll3\ncore, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one alleged.” D’Amelio, 683\nF.3d at 4l9-2l).

The “Core of Criminality” of Counts Three and Four Was a\nScheme to Cause Underaged Girls to Travel to New York with\nan Intent to Violate New York Law.\n\nThe “core of criminality” of the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> offenses was a\nscheme to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. The Indictment\nitself was clear on its face. Count Four, specifically alleged in the “to wit”\nclauses that the charges were based on Jane’s travel “from Florida to New\nYork, New York” where Maxwell intended for her to engage in sex acts with\nEpstein “in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Ind. 4 2l at\nAl29. Count Three alleged that the object of the conspiracy was to cause\nunderage girls to travel across state lines with the intent that they “engage in\nsexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense”\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021142.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page95 of ll3\nthey found that Maxwell had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from\nNew Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place, they could convict\nher on the substantive <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count\nFour. Hence, the question in the Jury Note.\n\nThus, it was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for\nconviction under Count Four. The Court’s refusal to do so alloued the jury to\nmodify the essential elements of the charged offense and created a substantial\nlikelihood that Maxwell was convicted of a crime other than the one alleged in\nthe Indictment. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted\nMaxwell on Count Four based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a\nsubstantial likelihood that they improperly convicted her on the related\nconspiracy count (Count Three) based on the same conduct.

And the text of Section 3283 goes even further\nbeyond the definition provided in Section 35o9 by cov-\nering any crime “involving” the sexual abuse of a child.\nCongress therefore did not require that a particular\nstatute have actual sexual contact with a minor as an\nelement of its offense, but rather swept broadly to\ncover any crime that in any way involves sexual abuse\nas broadly defined.

That is the issue Judge\nNathan instructed the jury to resolve, and that is the\ncriminal conduct charged in Counts Three and Four of\nthe Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive amend-\nment or variance occurred.\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nCounts Three and Four charged Maxwell with ar-\nranging for Jane’s <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> to New York with\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sex acts with Ep-\nstein, in violation of New York state law, and with a\nconspiracy to transport minors to New York for the\nsame purpose. (A.l27-3o). At trial, the Government\nmarshalled evidence that Maxwell transported Jane to\nNew York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so,\nwith the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity\nthere. That evidence included detailed testimony from\nJane about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr.3l6-l9)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021728.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page8l of 93\n68\n\nFour alleged that Maxwell knouingly transported\nJane “with the intent that Jane engage in sexual ac-\ntivity for which any person can be charged with a crim-\ninal offense in violation of New York law.” (Tr.3o37;\nsee Tr.3o35 (second element of Count Four requires\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged\nin the indictment”)). Judge Nathan also instructed the\njury on one and only one predicate state offense: a vio-\nlation of N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o34, 3o37). The\ninstructions on Count Three incorporated this discus-\nsion of the elements of Count Four, and the only stat-\nute identified was N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o49-\n5o, 3o56-57).\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing\n\nnote:\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> of Jane’s return\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico\nwhere/if the intent was for Jane to en-\ngage in sexual activity, can she be found\nguilty under the second element?\n(Tr.3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the\nconclusion of which Judge Nathan determined she\nshould refer the jury back to the jury charge on the\nsecond element of Count Four because the jury note\nwas otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and le-\ngally.” (Tr.3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, Maxwell filed a leter seeking reconsid-\neration of Judge Nathan’s response and raising the\npossibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial\nvariance because, in her view, the note shoued that\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021734.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page87 of 93\n74\n\nprostitution must be a “significant or motivating pur-\npose” of the interstate <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span>). Maxwell only\ncame to the theory she nou advances after a lengthy\ndiscussion spanning ten pages of the transcript.\n(A.387). And that reading is far from clear: the jury’s\nquestion does not ask whether certain facts are suffi-\ncient for guilt; it asks whether Maxwell “can be found\nguilty” if a certain fact is true. Maxwell “can” be found\nguilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in\nNew Mexico, which is probative of Maxwell’s intent\nand role in transporting Jane. That is a perfectly sen-\nsible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was re-\npeatedly raised by defense counsel to Judge Nathan at\ntrial. (See, e.g., Tr.3l49).\n\nSeting aside the jury note, Maxwell’s position re-\nquires the jury to have reached a series of odd conclu-\nsions. Jane testified at length about her travel to New\nYork and the ensuing sexual abuse there. It would\nmake litle sense for the jury to reject that testimony,\nand then conclude that Maxwell arranged the uniden-\ntified commercial return flight Maxwell nou empha-\nsizes, for which there is no documentary evidence in\nthe record, including no specific corroboration of Max-\nwell’s role in arranging that flight. (Compare Br.79-8o\n(“[T]he jury likely believed that if they found Maxwell\nhad some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from\nNew Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken\nplace, they could convict her on the substantive trans-\nportation count ....”) with Tr.3l33 (defense argument\nthat there is “no evidence” Maxwell arranged a return\nflight from New Mexico)).

Jeffrey Epstein\nCase No, 2oo8CFOoo938lA\nDear Barbara,\nPursuant to our telephone conversation of November 3o, 2oo9 and your subsequent email\nto me, | am providing the follouing information to you concerning Jeffrey Epstein’s air travel\nfrom May l, 2oo9 through November 3o, 2oo9.\nAs you knou, Mr. Epstein was in the custody of the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office |\nuntil July 22, 2oo9. | have confirmed that since Mr. Epstein’s release from custody, he has\ntraveled twice by air. The first trip was on September l4, 2oo9 when he traveled by\nhelicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach\nCounty by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only\nother passenger. Both the trip and the mode of <span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> were pre-approved by\nprobation. On August 27, 2oo9 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to\nSikorsky Helicopters in northern Palm Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova\naccompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of\n<span class=\"highlight\">transportation</span> were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights\ntaken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. | am told there are not flight logs kept for the\nhelicopter but | am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another\ndocument confirming the September l4, 2oo9 Palm Beach - Miami helicopter flight. | am\nalso enclosing documents for the August 27, 2oo9 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.\nOn another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State\nAtorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of\nnis probation. None of this is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with\nprobation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. | note that many\nof the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scot Rothstein law\nOne Clearlake Centre, Suite l4oo 25o Australian Avenue South West Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\np 56l.659.83oo 56l.835.869l www.agwpa.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33l57\n"};
