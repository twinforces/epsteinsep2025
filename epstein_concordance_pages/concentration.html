STERNHEIAA\nespecially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up\nnegative.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is required to remove her PPE mask during physical searches,\nsubjecting her to higher risk of exposure to COVID. The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\nemployment as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\nnutrition, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto concentrate and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and\nconcentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep\nnegatively impacts her <span class=\"highlight\">concentration</span> and ability to focus on document review and defense\npreparation.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-8 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of 3\na)\n== Sess\n29 October, 2o2o\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Our\nparents taught us key values such as kindness, consideration, generosity, and an extremely\nhard work ethic. For example, from a very early age each of us had to learn and demonstrate\nwhat our father termed “the 3 Cs:Consideration, <span class=\"highlight\">Concentration</span> and Conciseness” and to\n\nl\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo497\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 52 of 77\n“always treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.” We were quizzed on these\nprinciples constantly and had to regularly report examples of hou we folloued them.

For example, | think it\nis no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),\nsubmersible pilot and more, as they all require dedication, <span class=\"highlight\">concentration</span> and quick thinking and\nreactions and no small amount of courage. These are not the usual pursuits of a\n“flipbberti-gibbet” or a “socialite”, terms with which my sister has been branded with to this day.\nGhislaine was always an extremely generous, thoughtful and kind host in New York to her many\nsiblings including me, and her many nieces and nephews which | deeply appreciated. She also\nhelped our mother greatly in her late life and exhibited deep caring and concern which | noticed\npersonally on many occasions. For example she dropped everything and flew to France at her\noun expense to help me with medical issues our mother was having and to just be there to\ncomfort her. She also did not hesitate to help her many personal friends with their problems not\nonly with kindness but practical help too and did not ask for anything in return.\n\nMy sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple companies and\norganizations which created products and services, as well as employment. An important\nexample is that in 2ol2, Ghislaine turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit,\nThe TerraMar Project, with the mission to create a \"global ocean community\" based on the\nidea of shared ounership and responsibility of the global “commons”—the high seas or\ninternational waters. Efforts like these to help our planet are sorely needed and frankly, our\nfragile Earth continues to need all the help and activism it can get.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor\nas soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking\nXanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax.\nSide effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with\ncontinued medication. Houever, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely.\ne Side effects of Xanax may include:\nDecreased libido, drousiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\n@ Side effects of Xanax XR may include:\nConstipation, decreased libido, depression, drousiness, fatigue, impaired\ncoordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\ne Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or\nXanax XR:\nAnxiety, blurred vision, decreased <span class=\"highlight\">concentration</span>, decreased mental clarity,\ndepression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot\nflushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle\ncramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching,\nweight loss\nWhy should Xanax not be prescribed?\nIf you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,\nyou should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or\nNizoral. Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced.\nDo not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrou-angle\nglaucoma.\nAnxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.\nDiscuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.\nSpecial warnings about Xanax\nXanax may cause you to become drousy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating\ndangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental\nalertness is not recommended.\nIf you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than\nfor anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long\nintervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor\nsupervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.\nAs with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage\nsuicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria knoun as mania. If you notice any new or unusual\n| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.\n|\n| Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,\nalcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.\no7/26/l7 Page 43 of 95 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nhtp://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/rxdrugprofiles/drugs/xanl49l.shtml 7/l9/2oo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32233\n"};
