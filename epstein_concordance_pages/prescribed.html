Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988). This presumption\nagainst retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal\ncontext. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span>\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span>” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis. Regarding step one, not only did Congress fail to include an express\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2659\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 25\nretroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment; it actually considered and rejected such a\nprovision, signaling its clear intent that the amendment not be retroactive. Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span>” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span>” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). Here, the\nlegislative history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,\nwhich would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity\nprovision. Child Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. llo4, lo8th Cong. § 2o2 (2oo3) (“The\namendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense commited\nbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section.”). The Senate version contained no\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo266o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 25\nretroactivity provision. PROTECT Act, S. l5l, lo8th Cong. (as engrossed in the Senate, Feb.\n24. 2oo3). When the House and Senate conferenced to resolve differences between the bills, the\nretroactivity provision was omited. As Senator Leahy, one of the bill’s original co-sponsors and\na former chair of the Senate Judiciary Commitee, stated on the Senate floor, the omission was\nintentional: “I am pleased that the conference agreed to drop language from the original House-\npassed bill that would have extended the limitations period retroactively.” Senator Leahy,\nAmber Legislation, Cong. Rec. l49:5o, $5l47 (2oo3).\n\nSuch a clear expression of congressional intent should end the Landgraf analysis at the\nfirst step. In applying Landgraf, the Supreme Court has made clear that the “expressly\n<span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span>” analysis is not limited to the text of the statute, but may look to legislative history.\nSee Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history”\nas part of first Landgraf step); see also Latab v. Ashcroft, 384 F. 3d 8, l4 (lst Cir. 2oo4) (‘our\ninquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of\nstatutory construction, such as the statute’s structure and legislative history”). Indeed, Landgraf\nitself included a legislative history analysis. 5ll U.S. at 264. In Landgraf, houever, the Court\nconcluded that the legislative history at issue did not clearly evidence Congress’ intent regarding\nretroactivity. Jd. That is not the case here.\n\nAs Judge Katzmann of the Second Circuit has recognized, unambiguous legislative\nhistory should not be disregarded:\n\nWhen courts construe statutes in ways that respect what legislators consider their\n\nwork product, the judiciary not only is more likely to reach the correct result, but\n\nalso promotes comity with the first branch of government. It is a bipartisan\n\ninstitutional perspective within Congress that courts should consider reliable\n\nlegislative history and that failing to do so impugns Congress’s workways.\n\nRobert A. Katzmann, Judging Statutes (2ol4), at 36. Consideration and rejection by Congress of\na legislative proposal is one of the clearest expressions of congressional intent, and courts\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo266l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002663.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 25\nhad expressly <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> that the 2oo3 Amendment would not be retroactive; Weingarten\nconsidered only whether there was an express prescription that the 2oo3 Amendment would be\nretroactive, concluding that the defendant’s counsel could have made “colorable” arguments that\nthere was no such prescription. Jd. at 58.°\n\nCongressional intent here could not be clearer. The House bill would have made the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive, the Senate bill did not, and the conference consciously rejected the\nretroactivity provision. It is unnecessary to proceed to the second Landgraf step, and Counts\nOne through Four are time-barred.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\n\noffenses would have impermissible effects.\n\nIf the Court were to proceed to the second Landgraf step—whether application of the\n2oo3 Amendment here would have an impermissible retroactive effect—that step also counsels\nagainst retroactivity.\n\nAny analysis of the retroactivity of a criminal statute of limitations under the second step\nof Landgraf must be undertaken in conjunction with the principle that unlike civil statutes of\nlimitation, “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). As one court recognized in\ndeclining to extend a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, if Landgraf and\nToussie “are read in conjunction,” courts “must interpret the statute of limitations in a manner\nfavoring repose for Defendant.” United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7).\n\n* Nor was this clear evidence of congressional intent raised or considered in United States v. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (S.D.N.Y.

Therefore, the Defendant’s Equal Protection claim must be rejected.\nTH. JSSA\nSchulte’s remaining claims arise under the JSSA. To succeed on these claims, he must |\ndemonstrate a “substantial failure to comply” with the JSSA’s provisions.

The Court holds that Schulte cannot demonstrate a substantial failure to comply |\nwith the JSSA and that his statutory claims must therefore be rejected.” :\nAs an initial mater, Schulte repleads his Sixth Amendment fair cross-section challenge\n\nunder the ISSA. (Schulte Br. at l9.) But given that the Duren test governs fair cross-section\nchallenges brought under both the Sixth Amendment and the JSSA, this claim must be dismissed :\nfor the reasons stated above. See supra ‘7-l7. |\nApart from his fair cross-section challenge, Schulte also contends that the follouing :\ndefects constitute substantial violations of the JSSA: (l) the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains and not Manhatan; (2) the exclusion of inactive voters from :\ncertain counties located in the White Plains array; (3) the allegedly erroneous proration of jurors ,\n'l To be sure, these arguments were already rejected by the Court under the systematic exclusion\nprong of the Sixth Amendment analysis.

For the reasons set forth belou, the 2oo3 amendment of\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 satisfies both steps of Landgraf, and should be applied to pre-enactment conduct.\n\nl. The 2oo3 Amendment Satisfies Step One of Landgraf\n\nAt step one of the Landgraf analysis, the question is whether Congress has “expressly\n<span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> the statute’s proper reach.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. When evaluating Congress’s\nintent at step one of the Landgraf inquiry, the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the legislative history. Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o6-o8. In this case, the amended\nversions of Section 3283 evince Congress’s express intent to extend the statute of limitations. The\ntext and history of Section 3283 firmly establish that, with each amendment of the statute of\nlimitations, Congress intended to repeal and replace the prior version of the statute and thereby\nextend the time to bring live charges of child sexual abuse.\n\nThe 2oo3 amendment, like the l994 version of the statute, specifically states that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a child sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution of such offense during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3).\nClaims that were live in 2oo3 were, at the time, subject to the then-existing statute of limitations,\nwhich ran until the victims reached the age of 25. Whenever that statute of limitations ran, it would\n“otherwise preclude prosecution.” Instead, that statute of limitations was replaced by the 2oo3\namendment.\n\nThe Eighth and Ninth Circuits have both held that Congress intended to extend the statute\nof limitations for live claims of sexual abuse. In United States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682 (8™ Cir.\n2oo5), the Eighth Circuit reasoned that “both the title and wording of § 35o9(k) indicate that\nCongress intended by it to extend the general statute of limitations. . . . § 35o9(k) was later\nrecodified at § 3283 and continued to extend the statute of limitations in child abuse cases.” Jd. at\n684 (citing United States v.

Background\n\nl. The SDNY and Local Rules for the Division of Business\n\nThe defendant’s brief repeatedly uses the term “Division” to describe a “White Plains\nDivision” and a “Manhatan Division.” (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 9 at 2 (“On June 29, 2o2o, the\ngovernment filed a sealed indictment of Ms. Maxwell in the Manhatan Division of this Court. The\ngovernment has conceded that Ms. Maxwell’s indictment was obtained using a grand jury seated\nin White Plains, apparently with jurors drawn exclusively from the White Plains Division.”)). Her\nuse of the term “division” is imprecise and atributes legal significance where there is none.\nUnderstanding hou that is so requires some background.\n\nDistrict courts in each state in the United States are <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> by statute. United States\ndistrict courts in New York State are divided between four districts: Northern, Southern, Eastern\nand Western. 28 U.S.C. § ll2. While certain districts in other states are further divided into\n“divisions” by statute, see, e.g., id. § 8l (dividing Alabama into three “districts” and multiple\n“divisions” within each district), the federal districts in New York State are not so divided.

While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary.

Duren, 439 U.S.\nat 368.\n\n' The government takes issue with Ms. Maxwell’s use of the terms “Manhatan Division” and “White Plains\nDivision” in her opening brief, on the ground that the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute.\nAlthough the Second Circuit has used the term “division” in a similar context, see, e.g., United States v. Jackman,\n46 F.3d l24o, l24l (2d Cir. l995) (referring to “Hartford Division”), Ms. Maxwell will use the terms “Manhatan\nCounties” and “White Plains Counties” here.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l6 of 23\nconsider extrinsic evidence of the parties’ intent.’ To the extent that the Court finds that\nextrinsic evidence is relevant, houever, the government’s argument demonstrates precisely why\nthe Court should permit discovery in this action. While the government ludicrously faults Ms.\nMaxwell for failing to produce “documentary evidence” of the parties’ intent and the scope of\nthe SDFL investigation (Opp. lo), Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty to the NPA, has no access to such\nevidence without discovery. Any evidence of the parties’ intent would be in the possession of\nthe government and Epstein’s counsel, and at this stage, Ms. Maxwell can only scour the few\nclues available to the public—such as a privilege log filed in a related civil lawsuit—for crumbs\nof information about the negotiation and investigation.\n\nThe government’s response to those crumbs illustrates why any consideration of extrinsic\nevidence—which, as noted above, is unnecessary given the unambiguous text of the NPA—\nshould be preceded by discovery. In her opening memorandum, Ms. Maxwell cited to three\npages from the above-referenced privilege log in a civil lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims,\nall of which contain entries reflecting the USAO-SDFL’s consultation with the United States\nAtorney’s Office for this District, travel by USAO-SDFL atorneys to New York, or interviews\nand/or subpoenas of New York-based witnesses.

In response, the government has focused on only one of\nthose three entries and produced the documents referenced in the privilege log. See Opp. lo.\n\n7 The government’s argument that a United States Atorney lacks the “authority” to bind other districts (Opp. l3-\nl4)—and that the government can simply walk away from a plea agreement in which a United States Atorney has\nnot received the approvals <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> by internal Justice Department guidelines—is unavailing. The government\ncites no case in which a court has invalidated a plea agreement on this basis, and its argument is contradicted not\nonly by the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits—in which the default rule is that plea agreements bind other\ndistricts—but also by the Second Circuit’s statement that a United States Atorney may bind other districts in a plea\nagreement if there is an affirmative appearance to that effect.

From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and Cosby was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b).

Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005517.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 62 of 69\nVIII.

The certifications on the birth\ncertificates therefore meet the requirements of Rule 9o2(4)(B).\n\nSecond, as noted above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l) explains that the evidence\nnecessary to “evince[] an official record” that is “kept within the United States[ or] any state” is\n“a copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record and accompanied by a certificate\nthat the officer has custody.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 27 (incorporating\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on this subject).

Each of the certifications\ndescribed above is by a public officer with official duties in the location where the birth certificate\nis kept, as stated in the certification, and each is sealed. That is sufficient.

In fact, it cannot clear either of them.\nAt step one, Congress clearly evinced an intent that the 2oo3 amendment operate\nonly prospectively.

Here, Congress “expressly <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span>”\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment was to apply prospectively only.\n\nTo begin with, the text of the 2oo3 amendment omits any mention of\nretroactivity. If anything, it points in the opposite direction. This section twice\nemploys forward-looking modal verbs: “would” and “shall.” See l8 U.S.C. 3283\n(“No statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an\noffense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the\nage of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for\nten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”’); see also Appalachian Pouer Co.\nv.

At the first step, “if Congress ex-\npressly <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> that a statute applies retroactively\nto antecedent conduct, the inquiry ends and the court\nenforces the statute as it is writen, save for constitu-\ntional concerns.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55. If,\nhouever, the “statute is ambiguous or contains no ex-\npress command regarding retroactivity,” then the\ncourt must turn to the second step, where “a reviewing\ncourt must determine whether applying the statute to\nantecedent conduct would create presumptively im-\npermissible retroactive effects.” Jd. at 55. “If it would,\nthen the court shall not apply the statute retroactively\nabsent clear congressional intent to the contrary.” Id.\n“If it would not, then the court shall apply the statute\nto antecedent conduct.” Id.\nB.

Maxwell’s arguments\nabout retroactivity are therefore inapplicable to\nCounts Three and Six.\nb. Applying Section 3283 to Maxwell\nComplies with Landgraf\n\nFurthermore, under the Landgraf framework, the\n2oo3 amendment to Section 3288 properly applies to\npre-enactment conduct for which the statute of limita-\ntions had not expired at the time the amendment was\npassed. Because the statute of limitations had not ex-\npired when Congress amended Section 3283 in 2oo8,\nthat amendment extended the limitations period for\nprosecuting Maxwell, rendering the charges timely.\n\ni.

Mr. PRET who was the\nInstitutional Duty Officer that week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:oo p.m. that evening and he was placed\nin the shouer area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call.\nSince Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to use the inmate telephone\nsystem, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that reportedly began with area code 347.

Houever,\nthere is documented evidence that Unit Managelaic_Iprovided a call to Mr. Epstein on July 3o, 2ol9, at 5:l5 p.m.,\nto gee friend, on a monitored telephone/speaker phone. The call was documented in a log that is\nmaintained in the Correctional Systems Department. Mr. Epstein was provided a call because he had not been able\nto conduct voice recording on the inmate telephone. This is standard procedure by the Unit Team at MCC New\nYork, to occasionally provide a call to new arrivals, when necessary.\n6. Direct Observation: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2ol9, until July 24, 2ol9.

The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.\nMoreover, the four suicide watch cells nou all have SENTRY Assignments of HoOl-oolL —HOol-oo4L. Further,\nPsychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants\nhave conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly\nrounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the selection category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of\nthis determination.\nTo ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks\nare conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP3o Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.\nExecutive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.\nResults will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\n<span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and\nresponsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll\nCall notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Atorney\nLog Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the\nAtorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after\nthe reconstruction team advised staff to secure them.

When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search.

Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\n<span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027314.jpg": "All staff members assigned to a suicide watch post are responsible for signing the post orders prior to performing the\nstaff suicide watch. Atached please find a copy of the NERO Waiver permiting staff monitored suicide watches in\nSHU.\nWith regard to SHU Suicide Prevention training, this continues to be conducted on a quarterly basis. Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all <span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\n<span class=\"highlight\">prescribed</span> by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8. Re-establishing\nthe Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory\npsychologist to provide critical clinical services.\nStaffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction.
