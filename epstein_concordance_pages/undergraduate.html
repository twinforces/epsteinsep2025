And you mentioned your Ph.D. Where did you receive that\nl7 from?\n\nl8 A. That was also from the University of Rhode Island.\n\nl9 Q. What is clinical psychology?\n2o A. Clinical psychology is the study of human thoughts and\n2l behaviors, both abnormal and normal. We also study\n22 psychopathology, treatment methods.

Dr. Loftus, are you familiar with the term \"curriculum\n\n8 vitae\"?\n\n9 A. Yes.\n\nlo Q. And is the abbreviation for that a CV?\n\nll A. Yes.\n\nl2 Q. And please tell the members of the jury what a curriculum\nl3 vitae is.\n\nl4 A. Well, typically, it's a document that expresses your\n\nl5 educational background, career, publications, awards, honors,\nl6 your professional life.\n\nl7 Q. And Dr. Loftus, do you, in fact, have a CV?\n\nl8 A. I do, yes.\n\nl9 Q. And for what period of time does your CV cover?\n2o A. Well, I think I have mentioned in there where I went to\n2l college, so it goes back to the l96os. And then just about\n22 everything that's happened professionally since that time.\n23 Q. Professor Loftus, I'm going to ask you questions about your\n24 background, research, education, etc. Would you benefit from\n25 being able to look at your CV?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo8 of 246 24o3\nLCGVMAX3 Loftus — direct\n\nl scientist in a field that doesn't have a Nobel Prize.\n\n2 Q.

I've received some lifetime\n7 awards even from the American Psychological Association, which\n8 is an organization that has many clinical psychologists as\n\n9 members.

And what kind of research do you perform?\n\nl9 A. Over the course of my career, I've done many hundreds of\n2o experiments.
