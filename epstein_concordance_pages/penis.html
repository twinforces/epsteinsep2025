Thomas wanted to be an actress and a model. Her agent told her that\nCosby was looking to mentor a promising young talent. Eventually, Cosby invited\nThomas to Reno for some personal acting lessons. Thomas believed that she would be\nstaying at a hotel, but, when she got to Reno, a car took her to a ranch house where\nCosby was staying. Cosby arranged a room in the house for her. When they were the\nonly two people left in the house, Cosby asked Thomas to audition for him by pretending\nto be an intoxicated person, which she explained to Cosby would be a challenge for her\nbecause she had never been intoxicated. Cosby asked hou she could play such a role\nwithout ever having had that experience. So, he gave her some wine. Thomas drank\nonly a litle of the wine before becoming extremely intoxicated. She faded in and out of\nconsciousness. At one point she came to on a bed only to find Cosby forcing his <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>\ninto her mouth. She passed out and awoke later feeling sick.\n\nChelan Lasha. Lasha met Cosby in l986, while she was working as an actress\nand model. She was only seventeen years old. Cosby was forty-eight. Cosby called her\nat her home, and later visited her there. Lasha then sent him modeling shots and spoke\nwith him a number of times on the phone about her career. Cosby invited her to meet\nhim in Las Vegas, where, he told her, someone would take beter pictures of her. He\nimplied that she could get a role on “The Cosby Shou.” Enticed by the prospect, Lasha\nwent to Las Vegas. As promised, once there, someone took pictures of her. Someone\nelse gave her a massage. Eventually, Lasha was alone with Cosby. He gave her a blue\npill, which he said was an antihistamine that would help with a cold from which she was\nsuffering. Cosby also provided her with a shot of liquor.

Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them. Physical\n\nisolation, closeness, contact are more important than verbal seduction.\n\n(p. 297)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagellof55\ntaking her to the movies and on shopping outings. (PSR 4 32). The defendant and Epstein gave\nJane gifts, and Jane came to look up to the defendant like an older sister figure. (PSR 4] 32-33).\n\nThe defendant and Epstein abused that relationship of trust in the worst way imaginable.\nThey sexually abused Jane starting when she was just l4 years old, and the sexual abuse continued\nfor years. (PSR § 36). When Jane was still only l4 years old, the defendant and Epstein instructed\nJane to follou them to Epstein’s bedroom where the defendant and Epstein fondled each other,\ncasually giggling about it, while Epstein asked Jane to take her top off. (PSR § 34). While this\nwas happening, “there were hands everywhere,” Epstein began to masturbate, and the defendant\nrubbed, kissed, and fondled Epstein. (/d.). After this initial sexual interaction, the defendant and\nEpstein continued to sexually abuse Jane. (PSR § 35). The defendant and Epstein taught Jane\nhou Epstein liked to be massaged and gave Jane instructions about touching Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>. (/d.).\nJane was l4 years old, and the defendant tried to make Jane feel like this was “very normal” and\n“not a big deal.” (/d.). Jane was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein between the ages of l4\nand l6 years old, and the defendant was frequently in the room when the abuse happened. (PSR\n36). Over time, the abuse escalated, and Epstein used vibrators on Jane, masturbated, put his\nfingers in Jane’s vagina, and asked Jane to straddle his face. U/d.). The defendant sometimes\ntouched Jane during these incidents; in particular, Jane recalled that the defendant touched her\nbreasts. (/d.). The sexual abuse was not limited to Palm Beach, Florida, as Jane traveled with the\ndefendant and Epstein to Epstein’s tounhouse in New York City and his ranch in New Mexico.\n(PSR § 37). Jane was sexually abused during those trips. (/d.).\n\n2. Sexual Abuse of Kate\n\nThe defendant and Epstein’s sexual abuse of Kate started in l994, around the same time\n\nthat the defendant and Epstein started sexually abusing Jane. (PSR § 39). After Kate, then l7\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo546", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel2 of 55\nyears old, told the defendant that she lived alone with her mother and that things were difficult at\nhome, the defendant introduced Kate to Epstein in London. (PSR {fj 39-4o). The defendant\ndelivered Kate to a naked Epstein in the defendant’s oun home for massages and told Kate to\n“have a good time.” (PSR 4 4l-42). During these massages, Epstein initiated sexual contact with\nher, puting her hand on his <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span> and grabbing Kate’s breasts and in between her legs. (/d.).\n\nKate traveled to meet both Maxwell and Epstein in Palm Beach, Litle Saint James, and\nNew York City when she was between approximately l8 and 24 years old. (PSR 4 43). Epstein\ninitiated sexual activity with Kate every time she spent time with him from when she was l7 years\nold through her early thirties. (/d.). The defendant brought up sexual topics with Kate, ranging\nfrom talking about hou sexually demanding Epstein was to asking if Kate knew of anyone to give\nEpstein a blou job to remarking that Epstein liked cute, young, prety girls like Kate. (PSR 44).\n\nWhen Kate was approximately l8 years old, Kate visited Epstein and Maxwell at Epstein’s\nvilla in Palm Beach. (PSR 45). The defendant had left a schoolgirl outfit for Kate in the guest\nroom and told Kate that she thought it would be fun for Kate to take Epstein his tea in the outfit.\n(/d.). Kate—alone with only Epstein and the defendant in a place she had never previously\nvisited—complied. (/d.). Epstein raped Kate by engaging in forced intercourse with her. (/d.).\nLater that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she had fun and told Kate that she was a “good girl” and\n“one of [Epstein’s] favorites.” (d.). Epstein engaged in unwanted sexual activity with Kate\nmultiple times during that same trip. (/d.).\n\n3. Sexual Abuse of Annie Farmer\n\nThe defendant also took steps to normalize sexual contact with Annie Farmer, who was\nthen l6 years old. In the spring of l996, Annie’s mother, at Epstein’s request, agreed to send\nAnnie to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico for a retreat for a group of 2o to 25 students (both boys\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo547", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagel5oof55\ninvolved the same course of abuse. At some point during each massage, Epstein rolled over and\nbegan masturbating himself. (/d.). Epstein then directed Carolyn to touch his nipples and he\ntouched Carolyn’s breasts and butocks. (/d.). On one occasion, Epstein atempted to touch\nCarolyn’s vagina with a vibrator, but Carolyn pulled away, so he stopped. (/d.). On two occasions,\nEpstein brought other females into the room with Carolyn, who engaged Carolyn in oral sex, and\non one occasion Epstein raped Carolyn by penetrating her vagina with his <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>. (PSR { 72).\nEvery massage ended with Epstein ejaculating. (PSR 4 64).\n\nThe defendant personally scheduled Carolyn’s massages for approximately the first year\nor two, when Carolyn was between the ages of l4 and l5. (PSR § 66). When the defendant\nscheduled Carolyn for an appointment, she sometimes sent a car to pick Carolyn up. (/d.). At the\ntime, Carolyn was l4 or l5 years old and did not have a license. (/d.). Indeed, the defendant knew\nCarolyn’s age and much of her background because she had multiple conversations with Carolyn\nabout Carolyn’s life. (PSR 4 67). During these conversations, Carolyn revealed that she had\npreviously been sexually abused by a relative, that her parents were separated, and that her mother\nstruggled with addiction. (/d.). The defendant invited Carolyn to travel with the defendant and\nEpstein, but Carolyn explained that because she was only l4 years old, she would not be able to\nget permission to travel. (PSR 4 68). Carolyn was paid several hundred dollars in one-hundred-\ndollar bills after each massage. (PSR § 65). Usually, the money was laid out on the table or by\nthe sink in the bathroom, but the defendant personally paid Carolyn after a few massages. (/d.).\n\nThe defendant saw Carolyn fully nude in the massage room on approximately three\noccasions. (PSR 4 69). This happened when Carolyn had already undressed in preparation for the\nmassage but before Epstein had come into the room. (/d.). One particular instance stands out in\nCarolyn’s mind. (/d.). When Carolyn was l4 years old, she had set up the massage table and was\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo55o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 38 of 55\nunderstand what happened, hou it happened and why, and what its\neffect is certainly.\n(Tr. 742-43). Maxwell’s victims trusted her: she was a seemingly respectable woman who shoued\ninterest in them and promised to help them. She was key to the entire operation of the scheme,\nand Epstein could not have commited these crimes without her.\n\nMaxwell befriended her victims, won their trust, slouly broke doun their boundaries, and\nnormalized sexual abuse. For example, Jane testified that the defendant shoued her hou Epstein\nliked to be massaged and hou he liked his <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span> touched. The defendant did this when Jane was\nonly l4 years old. The defendant was an adult, in her thirties, helping to normalize abusive sexual\nconduct with a young teenager. The defendant’s demeanor was “casual, like it was — like it was\nvery normal, like it was not a big deal.” (Tr. 3o9). When Jane was in her twenties, she described\nMaxwell this way to her boyfriend, who remembered years later hou Jane told him that Epstein\nhad abused her, and the defendant had made her feel comfortable. (Tr. 644).\n\nThe degree to which the defendant manipulated her victims is an aggravating factor in this\ncase. But her abusive conduct did not end with the grooming and manipulation of the victims.\nShe also participated in the sexual abuse of her victims. Not only was Maxwell the person who\nwas most frequently in the room when Epstein abused Jane (Tr. 289), but multiple victims testified\nthat the defendant groped their breasts. (Tr. 3lo (Jane), 2224 (Annie), l536 (Carolyn)). In\nparticular, Annie described a terrifying encounter in which she found herself alone with Maxwell\nat Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, and Maxwell told her to remove her clothing so she could give\nAnnie a “massage” during which she rubbed Annie’s breasts. (Tr. 2224; PSR 4 52). That so-\ncalled massage was the defendant sexually abusing a teenage girl.\n\nThe conspiracy in this case was extensive and sophisticated by any metric: it involved\nmultiple victims, at multiple properties in different states, over a span of many years.

Maxwell purported to\nbefriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult\nsupervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize\nsexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.”\nMaxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing\nthen—l4-year-old Jane hou to touch Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span> during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s\nbreasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages.

After months of reporting, The Daily Beast’s\nConchita Sarnoff reveals exclusive details of the investigation and the legal wrangling that saved\nhim from a long prison term. She reports:\n* Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein’s “special treatment” and gave The Daily Beast an\nexclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation.\n* Earlier versions of the U.S atorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have\nlanded Epstein in prison for 2o years.\n«Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former\nSoviet republics, including three l2-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.\n* The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be\nevidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was\nconvicted of,\n* Epstein’s atorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered\nprivate investigators to follou and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.\n« Then-Atorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the\nJustice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.”\nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of\nprivilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach,\nwhich has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\nDuring Epstein's term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private\nCaribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—l3 months in the Palm\nBeach Stockade—he was alloued out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has setled more than a dozen\nlawsuits brought by the underage girts who were recruited to perform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven\nvictims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $l million—an\namount that will hardiy dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\nWith that, the knoun viclims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is\nclosed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and\nmay weil follou Polanski into a luxurious exile.\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His <span class=\"highlight\">Penis</span>\n, SIE-MAn- (o% op 356.T934>\nhtp:/Avww.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030606.jpg": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\n\nAgency ORI# FLO 5oo6oo\n\nPolice Case#: o5-368 (2)\nDefendant: Sarah Kellen ;\nRace/Sex: White Female\nDOB: o5-25-l975\nCharges: Principal in the l Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor (4) counts\n\nPrincipal in the l Lewd and Lascivious Molestation (l) count\n\nFrom March l5, 2oo5, through February 2oo6, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual\nbatery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was |\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>” left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. Cr WES ym yt =\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. 7c it al\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere is no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach.

The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nhtn-//Awww nrinthis.clickahilitv.com/pt/cot?action=cnt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\n\no7/26/l7 Page 25 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\na DOJ-OGR-ooo32o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032067.jpg": "The Fantasist raye oui 7\nNext: Epstein maintains he's done nothing wrong.\nThe police narrative has overtones of a man avoiding all connection or intimacy. For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell] spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years, Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber <span class=\"highlight\">penis</span>” teft in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. gy WES yom nit -\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. Four {\"\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro Jevel it mevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere ts no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgar and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they’d\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might fee! that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\n4 Yentord = |\nhtn:/hanans meinthic clickahility eam/nt/ent?action=ent&tle=ThetFantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 28 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032109.jpg": "What the Press Calls 'Epstein Sex Scandal’ Sounds a Bit More Like 'Rape' / Jossip Page | of 7\nLESLIE Cetebrity = x\noly | Dounload FPA) to check for availability, enter |\n+ Be Ly Yourheme phone number: =\n|\n| + Jossip Juxtaposition: Jeffrey Epstein Likes His Endings Happy and Underage | Home | Insert Joke About Staten Island E\n| Electricity Here +\n| WHAT THE PRESS CALLS 'EPSTEIN SEX SCANDAL' SOUNDS A BIT MORE I\n— THU, JUL 27, 2oo6 —\nOk, we knou we gave Jeffrey Epstein a minor bullet point in our litle OF\ngossip round-up.

On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach,\nwhich has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\nDuring Epstein's term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private\nCaribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—l3 months in the Palm\nBeach Stockade—he was alloued out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has setled more than a dozen\nlawsuits brought by the underage girts who were recruited to perform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven\nvictims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $l million—an\namount that will hardiy dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\nWith that, the knoun viclims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is\nclosed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and\nmay weil follou Polanski into a luxurious exile.\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His <span class=\"highlight\">Penis</span>\n, SIE-mAn- (o% 356.7934?\nhitp:/Avww.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033208.tif": "; LAW OFFICES OF\nGERALD B.

As set\nforth in the Report of the examination, the term “sexual contact” was given an\nextremely broad meaning in order to capture any inappropriate conduct that\ncould have occurred.” The results of the examination confirmed that (a) no\nsuch conduct occurred; (b) Epstein never threatened J (c)\ntold Epstein she was l8 years old; and (d) Epstein believed was\n* This memo is not exhaustive of facts of which the defense is aware.
