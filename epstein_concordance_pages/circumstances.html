The government makes this drastic demand even though Mr. Epstein has never once\natempted to flee the United States — despite a Florida federal judge’s stated belief that he could\nvoid the NPA in appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, possibly threatening new charges there, and\nnotwithstanding legally erroneous government assertions in ancillary litigation that Mr. Epstein\nwas subject to potential prosecution in other federal judicial districts, including this one\nspecifically. Indeed, Mr. Epstein feared the toxic political climate might tempt the government to\ntry and end-run the NPA -— yet continually returned home from travel abroad, fully prepared to\nvindicate his rights under the agreement and otherwise mount a full-throated defense. Finally,\nthe government takes its extreme position in the teeth of Mr. Epstein’s perfect compliance with\nonerous sex offender registration requirements — pinpointing his exact nightly whereabouts —\nacross multiple jurisdictions over a lo-year period.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000277.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 4 of l6\n4.

Hanson, 6l3 F.\nSupp. 2d 85, 87 (D.D.C. 2oo9). A person facing trial generally must be released so long as some\n“condition, or combination of conditions . . . [can] reasonably assure the appearance of the\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c).\n“Only in rare <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> should release be denied.” United States v. Motamedi, 767 F.2d\nl4o3, l4o5 (9th Cir. l985). Any doubts as to the propriety of release are resolved in the\ndefendant’s favor. See United States v. Chen, 82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o7 (N.D. Cal. l992).\n4 Mr. Epstein’s lone foreign residence is in Paris; France has an extradition treaty with the United\nStates.\n° Mr. Epstein ouns one private jet.

See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag\nbetween the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000283.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lo of l6\n\nTo reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “/east restrictive”\nconditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)\n(emphasis added). Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns.

Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v.

Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975).

Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity.

Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000332.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 4ofl4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span> of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence.

Payments to Potential Witnesses!\n\nIn a July l2, 2ol9 leter, the Government informed the Court that the Government had\nrecently obtained records from a financial institution (“Institution-l”) that appeared to shou the\ndefendant had made suspicious payments shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing, on\napproximately November 28, 2ol8, a series of articles relating to the defendant, his alleged sexual\nmisconduct, and the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> under which he entered into a non-prosecution agreement\n(“NPA”) with the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2oo7.

The bail package originally was\n\nnot accompanied by a financial statement reflecting Mr. Epstein’s finances.

Dkt. l4 at l8.\n\nThe Government responded to the Defense motion on July l2, 2ol9, arguing, among |\n\n| other things, that Mr. Epstein “has a history of obstruction and manipulation of witnesses,\n\nincluding . . . as recently as within the past year, when media reports about his conduct [in\n\nFlorida] reemerged.” Dkt. ll at l. The Government filing was made against a “backdrop of\n\nsignificant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges, and the prospect of a lengthy\n\nprison sentence.” Id.

For\nexample, the Government says: “[R]ecords from Institution-l shou that on or about November\n3o, 2ol8, or two days after the series in the Miami Herald began, the defendant wired $loo,ooo\nfrom a trust account he controlled to .. . , an individual named as a potential co-conspirator.”\n\nDkt. 23 at l.

Dangerousness\n\nmeans that the defendant is a “danger to the safety of any other person or the community.” l8\n\nU.S.C. § 3l42. A finding of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. “[T]he |\n\nconstitutional limits on a detention period based on dangerousness to the community may be\n\nlooser than the limits on a detention period based solely on risk of flight.

The Court finds that the Government has shoun by a preponderance\nof the evidence that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk. |\nThe factors to be considered in analyzing risk of flight are the same factors that apply |\nwhen analyzing dangerousness.

These crimes, as already noted, carry a maximum sentence of 45 years of |\nincarceration and give rise to a presumption of pre-trial remand. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E); see |\nUnited States v. Hardy, 2ol9 WL 22ll2lo, at *lo (D.D.C. May 22, 2ol9) (“The significant |\nharms and dangers of these crimes animated the Congress to create the statutory presumption of |\ndetention.”). The nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the crimes charged and the severity of the potential !\npunishment support a finding that Defendant poses “a serious flight risk and that no conditions\ncan be set to reasonably assure his appearance for trial.” United States v.

The evidence includes |\ntestimony of victims, some of whom were minor girls when they were allegedly sexually abused |\nby Mr. Epstein; other witnesses, including potential coconspirators; physical evidence, including\npassports reflecting extensive foreign travel; sexually suggestive photographs of nude underage |\ngirls; plea discussions; and police reports describing witness tampering and intimidation.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo747\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000749.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 4 of lo\nIll. Discussion\n\nA. The In re Craig Factors\n\nThe Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors\nand any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic disclosure in unique <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. Jn re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can\ngovernment opposition preclude it.”).

At the outset of the ll9th Congress, on February ll, 2o25, the\nCommitee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a leter to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession\nregarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.” On May 8, the Task Force\nsent another leter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein\nfiles’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000764.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 4of4\n\nHon.

What was done here is evidence and may be advantaged\nby either party, having in mind, of course, the question of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.\nAnd the only jurisdiction over such maters is in this court.”); see also, e.g., Dale v. Bartels, 532\nF. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. l982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony\nafter entry of a nolle prosequi). Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl.

Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured\nprofound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the\nyears follouing.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000870.jpg": "CaseGa26-2l-oo38 Adin dd Gumein4lB92 FiRNb6S/22/Phag Page of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors.

For starters, the defense explained that none of\nanonymous accusers’ testimony of abuse was corroborated and that it\nall related to Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell.

The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000950.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Tibet 2 oPiled OF2GSQoP aeengecs Boo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span> of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000954.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBROHAGN 2OdtUMENt/2o FilecOOAG2o2 P ahage of Gfooo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000963.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page 72cF 26oo\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000964.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAUIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP FOLO Page S°oF 26oo\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000965.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page SP '26oo\ninnocence.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\nb\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000968.jpg": "Chs8°F:26-c BOBSSAU RAND Se MEAL Hie EPAB?2O Pageers of 26o\n\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v. Chandler, l9-CR-867\n(PAC), 2o2o WL l528l2o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000970.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAUR DSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA 872o Paget? of 26o\n\nThe government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption.

As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of detention.

In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58\n\nl2 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment\nl3 if convicted. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight. The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001151.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo 8B G+ANEt DOEUMEr? loo2 Filed6R248/7thgPageb l636\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001153.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 4258/26 adedgect l Ob 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span> of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001164.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck A Ob 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\ndetention.”).

This rule is necessitated by the French\nConstitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (/d.).\nThus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition\ntreaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government’s reliance on a 2oo6 case—in which France refused to extradite a\nFrench national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to hou a French court\nwould rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the\nUnited States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (/d. at 2-3). Nor does it\nundermine Mr. Julie’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries\nhas executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a\nU.S. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government offers no rebutal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition\nexpert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly\nunlikely” to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government’s representation\nat the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at\n4/39). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (atached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 93).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). That discretion is limited to a handful of\nexceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001207.jpg": "CaSesk 2o-ef o33os Ade niDGchneHo lo32l , lB i2o F72geRage HOF 4\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be\nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.\n\n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell’ require\nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be\noppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in\nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under\nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights\nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in\nthe Opinion’.\n\n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly\nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to\ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.\n\n4. Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2oo3 (‘the 2oo3 Act’)\nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is\nsent to her by the extradition judge’. The ambit of the pouer in section 93 is\ndescribed at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse\nextradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable\nbar to extradition® is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the\nrequest has been withdrawn’; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from\n\n> Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition.\n* Opinion, paras. 27-29 and 36-37.\n° As appears to be submited by the Government at p.l9 of the Memorandum.\n° The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality\n(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the\nUnited Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A).\n’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 93(4)(a).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001212.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DONE? l/26 2 Filee6BaSO/RagPageBlGh22\nDefendant did not appeal the Court’s determination that detention was required, and she has been\nincarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nII. Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“|A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).

See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”’); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001217.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGNnt DOctina rf ll26 2 Filee6Ba3o/PagP ageBblGk22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001218.jpg": "Casast:2o-cr/ooBa@AuRnt B6cunde rt l/862 FileesRaSo/PtagPAgeblGh22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001221.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3oca one n Lee Gmeh'olo4o 2A il €@ 4273o) 26a geaGeol A Gb 22\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding\nindictment dated 7 July 2o2o.”); Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL\nl456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9\n(N.D.N.Y. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F.

In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\ndetermination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d\n3o6, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (describing the “Defense proposal to give advance consent to\nextradition and waiver of extradition rights” as “an empty gesture.”); United States v.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001272.jpg": "Casesb:2o-cr/oo8BOlAU At BONED l/2o 2 Filedees/2G/PagPage 48l65l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\n26.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001280.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutrent l682 lFiKOS3222/2agAaGeor o642\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001291.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye df d6i6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nNo. l7-CR-o2949-MV-l\n\nv.\n\nDASHAWN ROBERTSON,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nTHIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to\nReconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release.

On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting.

The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o).

When seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the\nburden of shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a\nrisk of flight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably\nassure her presence in court.

This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 4of lo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool49o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 5of lo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span> of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool49l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 9 of lo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 7 of 26\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 8 of 26\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ll) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (ll) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42q)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 9 of 26\ninnocence.”). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l2 of 26\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n° Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v.

Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n\n’ The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool592\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l4 of 26\n\nThe government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose. . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]Jny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption.

The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas aresult of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring.

In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” Jd. (emphasis in original).

The MDC’s response to the pandemic was the subject of\nextensive evidentiary hearings in the context ofa civil lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York.\nSee Chunn v.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page5of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nBut this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions\non the government’s ability to share discovery materials with prospective witnesses and their\ncounsel in whatever manner it deems necessary and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking\na restriction, not on the government, but on what the prospective witnesses and their counsel can\ndo with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.\n\nThe government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does\nnot appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is necessary given the\nuncommon <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses\nin the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct\nas that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already\nintertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2ol9 civil\ncomplaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also\nrepeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The\ndefense has a legitimate concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use\nany discovery materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run\nto the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court to require that the government’s witnesses\nand their counsel, like the defendant and defense counsel, must use the discovery materials only\nfor the purpose of preparing the criminal case.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, and in our opening leter, we respectfully submit that the\n\nCourt should enter the defendant’s proposed protective order.\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Christian R.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter motion\nseeking the Court’s assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell’s ability\nto receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the protective\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old. Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ Disclosure of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is\ntherefore critical for the defense to knou the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Such\ndisclosure is warranted when there is a specific shouing that the disclosure is material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the case. See\nid. at 3o2; United States v. Rueb, No. oo CR. 9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 4 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation.

Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to\nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom\ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms.\nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense\ncounsel.

The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def.

That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

Those\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District\nof New York opinion from 2oo9 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court\n' The Defense Leter states that the protective order was “entered” by the Court on July 3o, 2o2o.\nWhile that is the date the protective order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on\nJuly 3l, 2o2o.\n> The Government’s most recent discovery transmital leter also included the months and years of\nbirth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether\nshe will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline\nfor any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nThe government relies on two grounds to justify its position: (l) the need “to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims,” and (i) the “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a\nrequest. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). Both of these reasons are unpersuasive.\n\nAs to the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this\ncase, which significantly diminish any privacy interest that may exist. As we stated in our initial\nleter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil suits against Ms.\nMaxwell and have made public statements identifying themselves by name in court proceedings,\nto the press, and in other public fora. Although we cannot say for certain whether the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because at this point we can only guess\nwho they are—it seems likely that they, too, fall into this category. Furthermore, although these\nindividuals claim to have been minors when the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred\nroughly 25 years ago, they are no longer minors; they are nou adults in their early 4os. Nor has\nthe government argued that these alleged victims would be subject to any risk of intimidation or\nthat they would likely refuse to appear for trial if their identities were disclosed. Hence, any\nprivacy interest that may exist is diminished and should not supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to\nprepare her defense to ensure a fair trial. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of alleged\nrape victim and stating, “Inasmuch as the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the\nidentity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the\nlikelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant in being able to\nprepare a defense outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the name of [the alleged\nvictim] undisclosed.”’).\n\nThe government’s assertion that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request is\nincorrect. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). The case law in this Circuit is unambiguous that the Court has the\npouer to grant the requested relief. As we stated in our initial leter, the Second Circuit formally\nrecognized that district courts have the authority to order the disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Although\nCannone, itself, found that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the disclosure of\nwitness identities under the facts of that case, the government acknouledges that this Court has\nthe authority under Cannone to issue such an order in this case. (Gov’t Resp. at 2).\n\nThe defense also cited in its initial leter United States v. Warme, a directly analogous\nprecedent in which a district court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny to order the\ngovernment to disclose the identity of a rape victim to the defendant roughly one month after\nindictment—the exact same relief that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4). In Warme,\nthe defendant asked the district court to order the government to disclose the identity of a victim\nwho was allegedly raped by the defendant a litle over two years before the indictment was filed,\nsomeone if you already knou who that person is. Moreover, it raises the question of why the government is\nunwilling to go the extra step and simply provide the defense with the actual birthdays of the alleged victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001767.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 54 Filed o9/o8/2o Page 5 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These suggestions are\ndisingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented.

See\nUnited States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO), 2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y.

(Def. Ltr. l, 4). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule\nl6 only insofar as “it could be used to counter the government’s case or bolster a defense.” United\nStates v. Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d Cir. l993). Thus, materials that are wholly irrelevant\nto the Government’s case or the charges in the Indictment do not fall under Rule l6. That is the\ncase here. Contrary to the defense’s claim, the Government has not charged Maxwell with being\nJeffrey Epstein’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def. Ltr. 3). Instead, the\ndefendant is charged with helping Epstein identify, groom, and sexually abuse multiple minor\nvictims between l994 and l997. The Indictment does not allege that the defendant engaged in\nsuch conduct after l997. As such, the Materials are simply not relevant to the charges in the\nIndictment, much less exculpatory to the defendant.\n\nMaxwell’s argument is equally flawed with respect to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).\nThe Indictment alleges that the Government’s evidence on Counts One through Four based on her\nconduct from l994 to l997 is also evidence of the falsity of the answers provided in the deposition.\nSpecifically, the portions of her deposition that the Government alleges in the Indictment are false\nare all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period l994 through l997. Indeed, paragraph eight of the\nIndictment notes that the defendant’s statements during her deposition contradicted “some of the\nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period from l994 through l997. (Indictment, Docket No. l7, at\nlo). Consistent with that position, Counts Five and Six both incorporate by reference paragraphs\none through eight of the Indictment. (See id. at l5-l6). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant\ndid or did not participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at different times or on different\noccasions not charged in the Indictment would not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate\nthe defendant on those counts.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more importantly, the Government is not suggesting that these\nMaterials should be kept from the defense indefinitely. Rather, the Government requests\nauthorization to provide these Materials eight weeks prior to trial, along with its production of\nstatements of other non-testifying witnesses. Even assuming arguendo that the Materials\nconstitute Brady or Rule l6 evidence—which they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—\nthe defendant cites no case law for the proposition that she is entitled to their production nou,\nrather than eight weeks in advance of trial. The Second Circuit has held that “as a general rule,\nBrady and its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment\nmaterial upon request by a defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l46 (2d Cir. 2ool).\nInstead, “the Government ‘suppresses’ evidence within the meaning of Brady only if it fails to\ndisclose Brady and Giglio material in time for its effective use at trial or at a plea proceeding.” Jd.\nWhat constitutes sufficient time for “effective use at trial” depends on the “materiality of that\nevidence” and “the particular <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the case.” Id.\n\nHere, the defendant has made no shouing as to why eight weeks in advance of trial would\nnot be enough time to make “effective use” of the Materials at trial or hou she would otherwise\nbe prejudiced by the Government’s proposed disclosure timeline.

Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity.

By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Unit lo South, aka “the terrorist SHU”.

In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 transaction under a fake name and not be detected. So there\n\n5 really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie\n6 about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the\n7 means to do so. All of those things should be extremely\n\n8 concerning to the court, your Honor, as the court evaluates\n\n9 whether the defendant has the ability and willingness to live\nlo off the grid indefinitely. A year is an extremely long period\nll of time to live in hiding, undetected by the public. And so\n\nl2 all of those things are concerning.\n\nl3 With respect to the question of motive, your Honor,\n\nl4 the government submits the court need not reach that ultimate\nl5 issue, but we noted, your Honor, that there are indicia during\nl6 the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the defendant's arrest that suggested that\nl7 there was a motive to evade detection by law enforcement.

In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58\n\nl2 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment\nl3 if convicted. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight. The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes.

Likewise, the possibility that Ms. Maxwell could evade\n2 security guards or monitoring is a significant one.\n\n3 The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence\n\n4 that no combination of conditions could reasonably assure her\n\n5 presence in court. The risks are simply too great.\n\n6 Defense cites a number of cases, including Esposito,\n\n7 Dreier, and Madoff, as examples of serious and high-profile\n\n8 prosecutions where the courts, over the government's objection,\n9 granted bail to defendants with significant financial\n\nlo resources. But unlike those defendants, Ms. Maxwell possesses\nll significant foreign connections.\n\nl2 This case is distinguishable for other reasons, as\n\nl3 well. For example, the risk of flight in Esposito appears to\nl4 have been based on the resources available to defendant, not\n\nl5 foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from\nl6 being found.\n\nl7 In Madoff, the defendant had already been released on\nl8 a bail package agreed to by the parties for a considerable\n\nl9 period of time before the government sought detention.

This Opinion is provided pursuant to instructions from Peters and Peters Solicitors LLP’ dated l2\nAugust 2o2o in the context of bail proceedings relating to Ms Ghislaine Maxwell before the United\nStates District Court, Southern District of New York. Subsequent instructions have confirmed that Ms\nMaxwell will execute a waiver of her right to extradition that could be exhibited to a future extradition\nrequest made by the United States and relied upon in any extradition proceedings. The specific\nquestions asked by Peters and Peters are atached at Annex A. A summary of counsel’s relevant\nexperience is atached at Annex B. The waiver is atached at Annex C.\n\n2. Insummary:\n\n(a) Extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom are governed by the Extradition Act 2oo3\n(‘the 2oo3 Act’) and, in general, comprise; (i) a hearing before a designated ‘appropriate\nJudge’ (the extradition hearing); and (i) an appeal, subject to a leave requirement.\n\n(b) In proceedings under the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may consent to their extradition\nwhich has the effect of removing the need for an extradition hearing and waiving the\nperson’s statutory appeal rights.\n\n(c) In the majority of cases, proceedings in England and Wales in relation to US extradition\nrequests are concluded in under two years’. The process is significantly shorter if the\nrequested person consents to their extradition and in those cases the timescales are\napproximately between one and three months.\n\n(d) It is extremely unlikely that bail would be granted in an extradition case in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United States\nprior to trial and in breach of bail.\n\n' The follouing documents were annexed to the instructions: (a) Superseding Indictment, United States v Ghislaine\nMaxwell, dated 8 July 2o2o; (b) a transcript of the arraignment and bail hearing that took place on l4 July 2o2o; (c) the\nMotion to Detain the Defendant dated 2 July 2o2o; (d) the Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion for Detention dated\nlo July 2o2o; (e) and the Government Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention dated l3 July 2o2o.\n° There is no data as to the duration of extradition proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland but it may be inferred\nthat the timescales are similar.\nl922623.l\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002102.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page 7 of 29\nAn overview of the timeframes in relation to US extradition requests\n\nl2. The timescales applicable to extradition proceedings are defined by statute and are set out in Annex D,\nalong with the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the time-limits can be extended.\n\nl3. There are few publicly available figures with respect to the timescales in Part 2 extradition cases in\ngeneral, and none with respect to US extradition cases. In July 2ol3, the UK Government estimated that,\non average, Part 2 extradition cases took approximately lo months to conclude*’. In practice, contested\nUS extradition cases can take longer than lo months, although the majority conclude within two years.\n\nl4. These timescales are significantly reduced in cases such as this one where the requested person consents\nto his or her extradition at an early stage in the process. In those cases, extradition would be likely to take\nplace within three months.\n\nB. Consent to extradition\n\nl5. At the initial hearing where a requested person is first produced before the court, the appropriate judge is\nrequired to give them “the required information about consent”’**. This information is: (a) that the person\nmay consent to extradition; (b) an explanation of the effect of consent and the procedure that will apply if\nconsent is given; and (c) that consent must be given in writing and is irrevocable”.\n\nl6.

Extradition requests are rarely discharged on the basis that the case in the requesting state is politically\nmotivated or abusive. It is well established that there is a presumption of good faith in relation to a\nrequesting state, such as the US, which has a long history of respect for democracy, human rights and\nthe rule of law, and which has longstanding extradition arrangements with the United Kingdom”.\n\n28.

It is also highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to establish that her extradition was sought\nfor the purpose of prosecuting or punishing her on account of her political opinions, or that she might\nbe prejudiced at her trial or punished, detained or restricted in her personal liberty by reason of those\nopinions”.\n\nPassage of time\n\n3o. Notwithstanding the date of the allegations in the superseding indictment, a judge is unlikely to\nconclude that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite Ms Maxwell by reason of the passage of\ntime since the alleged commission of the offences®. The courts have upheld orders for extradition in\ncases with similar timescales to those in Ms Maxwell’s case, including two cases involving historic\nallegations of sexual offending where the relevant time period was 2o and 33 years. In both cases, the\ncourts placed emphasis on the public interest in ensuring that extradition arrangements were honoured\nand in ensuring that serious allegations were tried”.\n\n3l. As to oppression, the graver the offence the higher the threshold for oppression™. Given the\nseriousness of the offences in Ms Maxwell’s case, it is unlikely that she would be able to establish that\nany personal or family hardship that might be caused by the extradition” should outweigh the public\n\n»° Ahmad v United Kingdom (2olo) 5l EHRR SE6, para. lo5.\n°° R (Bermingham) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2oo7| QB 727, para. loo.\n*' Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 8l.\n© Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 82.

Similarly, there is a high threshold in relation to injustice’,\nand it is very unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to meet it. There is a general presumption that\nJustice will be done despite the passage of time and the burden is on the requested person to establish\nthe contrary’. In assessing injustice, the appropriate judge would have regard to the procedural\nsafeguards that exist under US domestic law”. Further, the judge is very likely to place weight on the\nfact that Ms Maxwell had, in the hypothetical scenario under consideration, absconded from ongoing\nproceedings that would otherwise have resulted in her trial in the US. As the English High Court\nexpressed it in Zollman “the very fact that the accused invokes justice to prevent [their] extradition\nrequires consideration of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> which have led to the fact that [they are] not facing\njustice in the country from which [they have] fled””°. In those <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> it is very unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of passage of time to defeat extradition.\n\nForum\n\n32. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of forum, which applies where\nextradition would not be in the interests of justice because: (a) a substantial measure of the requested\nperson’s ‘relevant activity’ ”’ occurred in the UK; and (b) having regard to ‘the specified maters’””\nrelating to the interests of justice (and only those maters), the extradition should not take place”.\n\n33. Although some of the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment is said to have occurred in\nLondon”, three of the ‘specified maters’ are likely to weigh heavily against a finding that extradition\nwould be barred by forum. First, it appears that the majority of the harm caused by the offending”\nalleged in the superseding indictment occurred in the United States. An extradition judge would treat\n\n°° Kakis at 784.

The human rights grounds that might potentially\nbe relied upon by Ms Maxwell are considered in the paragraphs that follou®’.\n\nArticle 3 (prison conditions)\n\n36. Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

The decision in Love was based on section 9l of the 2oo3\nAct, and the court made no finding under Article 3 (para l23). In Hafeez, which was decided in January 2o2o, the High\nCourt received the same evidence as has been before the court in Zove, and concluded that “the evidence in this case falls\nwell short of the necessary threshold” to prove a breach of Article 3 based on the conditions at MDC and MCC (see\nHafeez v Government of the United States of America [2o2o] EWHC l55 (Admin), para. 66).\nl922623.l\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 29\nspecific concerns, such as access to medical care”’. In those <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition. It is common for assurances to be given in respect of\nconditions of detention and the treatment of physical and mental illness (and associated suicide prevention) and they\nform an important part of extradition law”.\n** Ahmad v United Kingdom 5l EHRR SE6, para. l33.\n”> Othman v United Kingdom (2ol2) 55 EHRR l, para. 258.\n°° Othman, para. 26o.\n\"7 R (on the application of HH) v Westminster City Magistrates’ Court [2ol3] l AC 338, para. 3o.\nl922623.l\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page 28 of 29\nAn application may be lodged out of time only where\nit appears to the High Court that (a) the appeal is necessary to\navoid real injustice, and the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> are exceptional and\nmake it appropriate for the appeal to be heard; or (b) the\nperson did everything reasonably possible to ensure that the\nnotice was given as soon as it could be given!®\nLodging an application for | Notice of application for leave to appeal must be lodged\npermission to appeal against | within l4 days of the day on which the order for discharge\ndischarge at the extradition | was made!’\nhearing\nThis time-limit may not be extended\nLodging an application for | Notice of application for leave to appeal must be lodged\npermission to appeal against | within l4 days of the day on which the requesting government\ndischarge by the Secretary _| is informed of the order for discharge”®\nof State\nThis time-limit may not be extended\nLodging an application for | l4 days, starting on the day on which the court makes it\nleave to appeal to the High | decision on the appeal to it”!\nCourt\nLodging an application to l4 days, starting on the day on which the High Court refuses\nthe Supreme Court for leave | leave to appeal\nto appeal\nLodging an appeal if leave it | 28 days starting on the day on which leave is granted”?\ngranted\nExtradition follouing appeal\nRemoval 28 days starting with: (a) the day on which the decision of the\nrelevant court becomes final, or (b) the day on which\nproceedings on the appeal are discontinued”*.\n'8 Extradition Act 2oo3, s. lo8(7A) and (8).\nl9 Extradition Act 2oo3, s. lo5(5).\n2° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. llo(5).\n2l Extradition Act 2oo3, s. ll4(5).\n» Extradition Act 2oo3, s. ll4(6).\n23 Extradition Act 2oo3, s. ll4(7).\n4 Extradition Act 2oo3, s. ll8(2).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002127.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\nany extradition request from the US Government to the competent French Authorities\n(“The Waiver’).

Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it\nis highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors, namely: her\nUnited States citizenship; the fact that she has signed an irrevocable Waiver in the USA;\nthe fact that in the present situation, the only way the issue would be raised in France is\nif Ms. Maxwell would have already fled to France in violation of very strict bail\nconditions, and the fact that a failure by French authorities to grant extradition would\nresult in an obligation to try Ms. Maxwell before French courts for the conduct described\nin the Indictment.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 9 of 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page ll of 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span> of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 22 of 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\ndetention.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l3 of l5\nas Mr. Julie’s accompanying rebutal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ leter ignores that the\nextradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absence of an\ninternational agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at l). This rule is necessitated by the French\nConstitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (/d.).\nThus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition\ntreaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government’s reliance on a 2oo6 case—in which France refused to extradite a\nFrench national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to hou a French court\nwould rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the\nUnited States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (/d. at 2-3). Nor does it\nundermine Mr. Julie’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries\nhas executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a\nU.S. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government offers no rebutal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition\nexpert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly\nunlikely” to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government’s representation\nat the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at\n439). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (atached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 4]3).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). That discretion is limited to a handful of\nexceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002228.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3-2 Filed l2/23/2o Page 3 of 4\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be\nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.\n\n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell? require\nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be\noppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in\nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under\nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights\nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in\nthe Opinion’.\n\n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly\nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to\ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.\n\n4. Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2oo3 (‘the 2oo3 Act’)\nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is\nsent to her by the extradition judge’. The ambit of the pouer in section 93 is\ndescribed at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse\nextradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable\nbar to extradition® is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the\nrequest has been withdrawn’; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from\n\n* Opinion, para. 26.

In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial detention continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “[e]xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that [it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”” United States v.

See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 8 of 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information—including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “[a] judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 9 of 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at 3o-33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002244.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l2 of 22\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding\nindictment dated 7 July 2o2o.”); Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers.

In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\ndetermination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F.

Joinder of Offenses\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part,\n(a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may charge a\ndefendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses\ncharged--whether felonies or misdemeanors or both--are of the same or\nsimilar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\nconnected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\n\nRule 8(a) sets forth three different <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which separate offenses may be\nproperly joined in the same indictment; namely, when the offenses: (l) “are of the same or\nsimilar character,” (2) “are based on the same act or transaction,” or (3) “are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging\nseparate offenses in the same indictment and allouing them to be tried together “inevitably\ninvolves some danger of prejudice” to the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where “gains in trial efficiency outweigh the recognized prejudice that accrues to\nthe accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37, lo42-43 (2d Cir.l988); see also United\nStates v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir. l98o) (purpose of Rule 8 is to promote “trial\nconvenience and economy of judicial and prosecutorial resources”); United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43o (2d Cir. l978) (“efficiency and economy” are the “customary justifications for\njoinder”).\n\nIn conducting a Rule 8(a) analysis, “no one characteristic is always sufficient to establish\n‘similarity’ of offenses ... and each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page 8 of l9\nBlakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d Cir. l99l) (quotations and citation omited). “‘Similar’ charges\ninclude those that are ‘somewhat alike,’ or those ‘having a general likeness’ to each\nother.” United States v. Rivera, 546 F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Werner, 62o F.2d at\n926). Offenses are “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of\nrelated transactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996). By contrast,\noffenses are not “connected” and joinder is inappropriate when “[c]ommission of one of the\noffenses neither depended upon nor necessarily led to the commission of the other; proof of the\none act neither constituted nor depended upon proof of the other.” Halper, 59o F.2d at 429.\n\nSimilarly, offenses that are separated by time and location, and were allegedly commited\nunder different <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, are not sufficiently connected to warrant joinder. See United\nStates v. Martinez, Nos. S2 92 Cr. 839 (SWK), l993 WL 322768, at *8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l9,\nl993) (granting severance of firearm possession and narcotics conspiracy counts where firearm\nwas seized in different location over four months after narcotics conspiracy ended “under\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> having no bearing on either the alleged narcotics conspiracy, or any of\n[defendant’s] coconspirators”); United States v.

Potamitis, 739 F.2d 784 (2d Cir. l984), joinder is not\nappropriate when the perjury or false statement allegations do not relate to, or have only a\nspeculative connection to, the other charges in the indictment.

The Perjury Counts therefore are not “of the same or similar character,”\nnor are they “based on the same act or transaction” as the Mann Act Counts and cannot be\njoined. Fed. R. Crim.

There is no allegation that Ms. Maxwell continued\nconspiring with Epstein, or engaged in any misconduct at all, in the intervening time period. In\nfact, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell in connection with the investigation that led to\nEpstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement in 2oo7, or in its 2ol9 indictment of Epstein, which\ncharged Epstein with sex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5. Joinder is improper when the\noffenses are separated by such a significant time period and do not relate to each other.

Such cases typically involve situations where the defendant was aware that he\nwas being investigated and either lied to the grand jury or made false statements to law\nenforcement officers in an effort to thwart the existing investigation into the other offenses with\nwhich he was charged.

Moreover, although the government alleges that some of the\nquestions posed at the depositions related to some of the alleged victims in this case (Indictment\n{| 2, 8), the questions were tangential to the defamation action, which was based on Ms.\nMaxwell’s denial of a purported conspiracy with Epstein from l999-2oo2 involving Ms. Giuffre.\nThe alleged false statements underlying the Perjury Counts therefore do not “concern” the Mann\nAct Counts and cannot be joined as part of a “common scheme or plan.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at\n79l.\n\nThe government makes only a half-hearted, and ineffective, atempt to allege a\nconnection between the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a).\nParagraph 2 of the Indictment alleges:\n\n[I]n an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned\n\nabout her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described\n\nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2ol6.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo229o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT ....... ee eeeeesereeeeereeeerteeeetertesieee I\nA.

The Protective Order in Giuffre v. Maxwell\n\nCounts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell commited\nperjury during two civil depositions taken in Giuffre v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case Virginia\nGiuffre filed in 2ol5. Giuffre claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell’s atorney-hired\npress agent denied as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Giuffre’s numerous allegations, over the span\nof four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause Giuffre to be “sexually abused\nand trafficked” by Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n' See Norman Mailer, “An Appeal to Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy,” 5/ll/8o New York\nTimes.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 23\n\nB. At A Minimum, This Court Should Order A Hearing At Which Maxwell\nMay Inquire Into The <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span> Surrounding The Government’s\nMisrepresentations To i\n\nIf the Court is disinclined to grant relief on the present record, then at a minimum it\nshould hold an evidentiary hearing to probe the government’s misstatements to [I\nand the extent to which the prosecutor’s office had, in fact, coordinated with J prior\nto the issuance of the grand jury subpoena. These factual issues go directly to whether the\npredicate finding for i ruling—namely, that no Chemical Bank collusion had\noccurred—was mistaken. See, e.g., United States v. Paredes-Cordova, No. Sl o3 CR. 987DAB,\n2oo9 WL l585776, at *l (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2oo9) (“An evidentiary hearing is normally required\nto address motions to suppress where a factual issue is in dispute.”).\n\nAn evidentiary hearing is warranted for an additional reason as well: If it turns out that\nthe prosecutor Anew (or was reckless in not knouing) that J had previously\napproached his office, both before and after the Maxwell depositions, in an effort to stir up a\ncriminal prosecution and dangled the deposition transcripts as a carrot, then suppression would\nbe warranted on that basis alone. Cf’ Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. l54, l55-56 (l978); United\nStates v. Rajaratnam, 7l9 F.3d l39, l46 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“Franks instructs a district court to hold\na hearing to determine whether the alleged misstatements or omissions in the warrant or wiretap\napplication were made intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth and, if so, whether\nany such misstatements or omissions were material.”).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor these reasons, this Court should: (l) suppress all evidence the government obtained\nfrom QM and any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July\n2ol6 depositions and all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six.\nMaxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this Motion.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 27\nCir. l978) (deciding prosecutor's question whether accused “handled” checks too ambiguous;\naccused could justifiably infer “handled” meant “touched”).\n\nMoreover, “a perjury conviction must rest on the uterance by the accused of a false\nstatement; it may not stand on a particular interpretation that a questioner places upon an\nanswer.” Id. at 374 (citing Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 36o). “[A]ny special problems arising from the\nliterally true but unresponsive answer are to be remedied through the ‘questioner's acuity’ and\nnot by a federal perjury prosecution.” Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 362. “The burden is on the\nquestioner to pin the witness doun to the specific object of the questioner's inquiry.” /d. at 36o.\n\nB. Count Five\n\nl. First question: “Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage\ngirls for sexual massages? If you knou.”\n\nThis was an improper question for many reasons and was, accordingly, the subject of\nwell-founded objections. The question asked for Ms. Maxwell to understand and comment on\nEpstein’s state of mind; any answer would either have been made without personal knouledge\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 6o2 or have been hearsay.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s answer—‘“I don’t knou what you are talking about” — was completely\nunderstandable, particularly given the context. At the time of the deposition, Epstein had pled\nguilty to a state indictment in Florida, and the facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the Palm\nBeach Police department investigation were widely knoun and discussed in the deposition. Ms.\nMaxwell’s answer, “I don’t knou what you are talking about,” was simply a true statement that\nthe question lacked clarity.\n\nThe Government has selectively, and misleadingly, omited testimony and objections to\nquestions that place Ms. Maxwell’s statement in context.

None of the Questions or Answers Were Material\n\nA. Materiality\n\nSection l623(a) of Title l8 of the U.S. Code states, in relevant part, that “[w]hoever\nunder oath ... in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United\nStates knouingly makes any false material declaration” shall be subject to criminal penalty\n(emphasis added). Thus, to violate § l623(a), a perjurious statement must be “material to the\nproceeding in which it is given.” United States v. Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997)\n(emphasis omited).\n\nTo be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable\nof influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it is addressed.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (quotation marks omited). When made during a civil\ndeposition, statements are material only if “a truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to\nlead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit.” United States v.\nKross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994). In proving materiality, it “is necessary . . . that the\ngovernment shou that the statement, if believed, could have influenced the decision” of the\ndecision-making body. United States v. Stern, No. o3 Cr. 8l, 2oo3 WL 22743897, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2o, 2oo3).\n\nAlthough issues of materiality are generally mixed questions of law and fact normally left\nto a jury, see Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23, under certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, like those presented in\nthis case, a court can decide this issue under Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(b). See United States v. Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo). Here, the deposition transcripts and Judge Preska’s\nruling provide the Court with the relevant undisputed facts to decide this motion. Thus a trial will\nnot assist in determining whether the Government can prove to a reasonable juror that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct violated l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). United States v. Nitschke, 843 F. Supp. 2d. 4, 9\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 26\nconsider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.” United States v.\nLovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 79o (l977); United States v. Lindstrom, 698 F.2d ll54, ll58 (llth Cir.\nl983). A defendant's shouing of prejudice triggers a “sensitive balancing of the government’s\nneed for an investigative delay ... against the prejudice asserted by the defendant.” United States\nv. Brand, 556 F.2d l3l2, l3l7 (Sth Cir. l977). For example, a delay caused by a good-faith\nongoing investigation will generally not be considered a due process violation. Lovasco, 43l\nU.S. at 79l. Governmental delay caused by “sinister” reasons that prejudice a defendant require\ndismissal of an indictment. “Sinister” motives include using the delay to gain tactical advantage\nover the accused or as a weapon to induce a defendant's cooperation. Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324.\n\n“Tactical” delay causing actual prejudice to a defendant violates the Due Process Clause\nof the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Lovasco, 43l U.S. at 795 n.l7.A\ntactical delay is one that the government employs as a “deliberate device to gain an advantage\nover” the accused. United States v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. l8o, l92 (l984). A due process violation\nalso occurs with prosecutorial delay incurred in reckless disregard of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, knoun to\nthe prosecution, suggesting that there existed an appreciable risk that delay would impair the\nability to mount an effective defense. Lovasco, 43l U.S. at 795 n.l7. The Supreme Court, in\nUnited States v. Eight Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($8,85o) in U.S. Currency,\n46l U.S. 555, 563 (l983), interpreted Lovasco as holding that claims of prejudicial pre-\nindictment delay can succeed “upon a shouing that the government delayed seeking an\nindictment in a deliberate atempt to gain an unfair tactical advantage over the defendant or in\nreckless disregard of its probable prejudicial impact upon the defendant's ability to defend\nagainst the charges.” “‘Reckless’ conduct means acting in a way that is ‘indifferent to\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002514.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 26\nconsequences.’” United States v. Sabath, 99o F. Supp. loo7, lol8 (N.D. Ill. l998) (quoting,\nBLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY l27o (6th ed.l99o)).\n\nAs noted by Chief Judge McMahon in United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n488-9l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), “[t]he Second Circuit has never specifically declined to adopt the\nLovasco ‘Footnote l7’ test (as restated in Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Dollars). Nor has\nit specifically found that pre-indictment delay engendered in reckless disregard of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nthat would likely impede a defendant's ability to mount a defense can never violate the Due\nProcess Clause.”\n\nCourts generally agree that (l) “tactical, reckless, or bad faith preindictment delay that\nunduly prejudices a defendant is constitutionally dubious,” United States v. McNeal, No. o3 CR\n8o, 2oo6 WL 76ol86, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 2o, 2oo6); and (2) determinations of prejudicial\npreindictment delay are fact-specific inquiries that will turn on the unique <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of a\ncase. See Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324-25; Lovasco, 43l US. at 797.4\n\nThis is that case.\n\n4 Several Circuit Courts of Appeal interpret Marion/Lovasco as requiring a balancing test that\nweighs the prejudice to a defendant against the government's reasons for the delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Valentine, 783 F.2d l4l3, l4l6 (9th Cir. l986); Houell v. Barker, 9o4 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.\nl99o); United States v. Soua, 34 F.3d 447, 45l (7th Cir. l994); United States v. Moran, 759 F.2d 777,\n782 (9th Cir. l985). See also United States v. Collamore, 75l F. Supp. lol2, lo27 (D. Me. l99o), aff'd,\n94o F.2d 646 (lst Cir. l99l) (quotation omited) (holding that a defendant may shou a due process\nviolation based on excessive preindictment delay incurred in reckless disregard of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, knoun\nto the prosecution, suggesting that there existed an appreciable risk that delay would impair the ability to\nmount an effective defense); and Schurman v. Leonardo, 768 F. Supp. 993, 998 (S.D.N.Y. l99l)\n(recognizing reckless disregard standard). Legal commentators have, for many years, discussed the\nCircuit split regarding the test to be applied to claims of pre-indictment delay and called for the U.S.\nSupreme Court to resolve the mater. See, e.g., Phyllis Goldfarb, “When Judges Abandon Analogy: The\nProblem of Delay in Commencing Criminal Prosecutions,” 3l WM. & MARY L. REV. 6o7 (l99o); Eli\nDuBosar, “Pre-Accusation Delay: An Issue Ripe for Adjudication by the United States Supreme Court,”\n4o FLA. ST. U. L. REV. 659 (2ol3); see also Hoo v. United States, 484 U.S. lo35, lo36 (l988), where\nJustice White noted that he would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits on this\nimportant question of constitutional law.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l4\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 22\ncase and use her oun words against her. 594 F.2d at 294. The Fifth Amendment would mean\nnothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections\nbecause the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so\nwithout notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered\nwith the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the\nbasis of perjury charges.\n\nThat is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government\nsubpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a\ncivil proceeding. 7oo F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Oshatz (who had been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition) was deposed and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against\nself-incrimination on “the understanding that a protective order would preserve his Fifth\nAmendment rights.” /d. at 699. Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government’s\nsubpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the “government [had] not\nargued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> or compelling need.” /d. at 7ol.\n\nHere, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on “the understanding that a protective order\nwould preserve” the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been\nindicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat\nwas the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement exception.\n(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require Giuffre to disclose any law enforcement\ninvestigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to\npreserve Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment rights. Where this Court in Oshatz granted a motion to\nquash, here it should grant a motion to suppress.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 38\nUnited States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985). Annabi supports dismissal here by\nconfirming that where, as here, both the text of the NPA and the facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the\nunderlying negotiations demonstrate an intent to bind the United States (other USAQs), they are\nso bound. Alternatively, any application of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL\nwould conflict with the likely interpretation of the NPA by the Eleventh Circuit, which should\napply in case of any such conflict.\n\nThird, the government argues that the co-conspirator immunity provision prohibits only\nprosecutions for (i) conduct between 2ool and 2oo7 and (i) statutory offenses specifically\nreferenced in the factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision\ncontains no such limitations and thus forecloses this argument. The text is clear, but even if it\nwere ambiguous, it must be strictly construed against the government.\n\nIn the alternative, to the extent there is any doubt that the NPA bars this prosecution, the\nfacts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the NPA at least raise sufficient issues regarding the parties’\nintent to warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Accordingly, if the\nindictment is not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell requests leave to conduct discovery as to the intent of\nthe parties to the NPA with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, as well as an\nevidentiary hearing in aid of this Motion.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nOn or about September 24, 2oo7, Epstein and his counsel entered into the NPA with\nAcosta, the United States Atorney for the SDFL.* While USAOs in a number of judicial\ndistricts, including this District, typically use a standard template for plea agreements and other\nnon-prosecution agreements, this NPA did not follou such a standard format. To the contrary,\n\n* A copy of the NPA is atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 38\nthe NPA’s language and structure, as well as the manner in which it was negotiated, were highly\natypical. The result was a one-off agreement that deviated in several material respects from, and\nbore litle resemblance to, a standard agreement.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s OPR, after investigating Acosta’s handling of the Epstein\ncase, characterized the NPA as a “unique resolution.” Exh. B (Dep’t of Justice, Office of\nProfessional Responsibility, Executive Summary of Report, Investigation into the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s Resolution of its 2oo6-2oo8 Federal\nCriminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the\nInvestigation, November 2o2o) at x. In particular, the OPR concluded that Acosta “agreed to\nseveral unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the consideration required under the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” Jd. While the co-conspirator immunity provision appears to be one of the terms\nto which the OPR was referring, the government is bound by it.\n\nA. The Structure of the NPA\n\nThe NPA is a seven-page document consisting of several factual recitals (NPA at l-2), a\nparagraph providing for the non-prosecution of Epstein if he complies with the NPA (id. at 2), a\nlist of enumerated “terms” (id. at 5), and, finally, five separate paragraphs containing various\nprovisions, including the co-conspirator immunity provision at issue here (id. at 5). Although it\ncontains no defined terms other than “State Atorney’s Office” and “Epstein,” the NPA clearly\nseparates “the United States” as a whole from the USAO-SDFL, repeatedly referring explicitly to\nthe USAO where such a limitation is intended. See, e.g., id. at 3 (“Epstein shall provide to the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office copies of all proposed agreements... .””); id. at 5 (“the United States\nAtorney has no authority” to bind state prosecutors); id. at 6 (“Epstein hereby requests that the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution”).

Even if there\nwere ambiguity, which there is not, that ambiguity must be construed against the government and\nin favor of the defense. Accordingly, the indictment must be dismissed. In the alternative, Ms.\nMaxwell should be permited to take discovery regarding the intent of the parties to the NPA\nwith respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, and the Court should hold an evidentiary\nhearing in aid of this Motion.\n\nI. The Indictment Should Be Dismissed for Breach of the NPA.\n\n“Plea agreements have long been interpreted in accordance with contract law principles.”\nUnited States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 269 (2d Cir. 2oo4). “In interpreting whether a plea\nagreement has been breached, this court looks to the reasonable understanding of the parties as to\nthe terms of the agreement.” /d. at 269-7o (internal quotations and citations omited). Houever,\nthe government “must bear the burden for any lack of clarity in the agreement and ambiguities\nshould be resolved in favor of the defendant.” Innes v. Dalsheim, 864 F.2d 974, 979 (2d Cir.\nl988). Here, the NPA unambiguously precludes prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators, and the indictment in this case must be dismissed.\n\nIn support of its July 2o2o motion for Ms. Maxwell’s detention, the government raised\nthree arguments why it contends the NPA does not bar Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution: (l) that Ms.\nMaxwell supposedly lacks standing to enforce the NPA; (i) that the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision applies only in the SDFL; and (i) that the provision is limited to conduct occurring\nduring the 2ool-o7 time period and to violations of statutes specifically referenced in the NPA.\nGovernment’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention (“Reply Mem.”), Dkt. No. 22 (filed\nJul. l3, 2o2o), at 5. None of these arguments has merit.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo259l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 34 of 38\nambiguities are construed, as they must be, against the government as drafter. In the alternative,\nhouever, the NPA and the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of its execution merit discovery and an evidentiary\nhearing regarding the parties’ intent.\n\nTo the extent that extrinsic materials do not make the parties’ intent clear, the Court is\nobligated to make a finding as to the parties’ “reasonable understanding,” with ambiguities\nresolved in Ms. Maxwell’s favor. See Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 27o (emphasis and citation\nomited). Courts in this circuit have routinely recognized the need for evidentiary hearings\nwhere the existence or scope of a plea agreement or non-prosecution agreement is in genuine\ndispute. See, e.g., id. at 27o (noting testimony from defendant’s atorney); United States v.\nAleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9l (2d Cir. 2oo2) (remanding where “the district court failed to make a\nrecord that allous us to determine the existence, scope and effect of an immunity agreement”);\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 67l (noting that district court heard testimony from two prosecutors,\ndefendant, and defendant’s counsel as of the time the plea agreement was reached); United States\nv. Papa, 533 F.2d 8l5, 82o (2d Cir. l975) (describing “two evidentiary hearings”); United States\nv. Satar, No. o2 Cr. 395 (JGK), 2oo3 WL 225lo398, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2oo3) (noting\nconclusion that “an evidentiary hearing was warranted . . . to determine whether an agreement\nexisted, what its terms were, and whether there was compliance with those terms”).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s request for an evidentiary hearing, and for discovery, is at least as strong\nas that in Feldman. There, the district court denied discovery to a defendant who claimed that\nthe government had served a writ of execution in violation of oral representations made in\nconnection with the defendant’s plea agreement, holding that the agreement’s merger provision\nbarred the consideration of any oral agreements or representations. The Second Circuit reversed,\nconcluding that “while the district court’s analysis might have been compelling with respect to a\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 35 of 38\ncontract arising out of commercial negotiations among private parties, we believe the court did\nnot correctly apply the standards that govern the interpretation of plea agreements with the\ngovernment. We have long recognized that plea agreements are significantly different from\ncommercial contracts.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (emphasis added). The court explained:\n\nGovernment conduct in negotiating plea agreements must comport with the\n\nhighest standard of fairness. Because such agreements involve waivers of\n\nfundamental constitutional rights, prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\n\nperformance.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omited). The court held that given the absence of\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing, “the record does not furnish a basis for a complete\nunderstanding of what happened in the course of the plea negotiations,” and that the defendant’s\nevidence was “sufficient in these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” to require the district court to take such action.\nTd. at l9o.\n\nUnlike the agreement in Fe/dman, the NPA here contains no integration clause, and the\nco-conspirator immunity provision, on its face, bars prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators without limitation as to judicial district, time period of the underlying conduct, or\nthe statutory violations alleged. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Feldman, Ms. Maxwell had\nno role in the negotiation of the NPA, and thus a// of the information relevant to its construction\nis in the possession of third parties. Houever, we understand that Epstein sought the maximum\nprotection from prosecution possible for his potential co-conspirators and that Main Justice\nparticipated in the negotiation of the NPA, and there is evidence that the USAO-SDFL consulted\nwith the USAO for this District in its investigation.

Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.

In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n” 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\na In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l4\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens.

OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nlX\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l9 of 25\n\nSince Bridges, the Court has repeatedly emphasized that statutory references to an\n“offense involving” or “offenses involving” certain elements call for such an approach. See\nShular, l4o S.Ct. at 785; Kawashima vy. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 (2ol2) (interpreting “offenses\nthat involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or\ndeceitful conduct’) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4)\n(stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to look to the elements and the\nnature of the offense . . .rather than to the particular facts” at issue); see also United States v.\nDavis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (“In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a\nstatutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.”). Thus, only if the offense “necessarily entails” the\nidentified conduct can it be said to be an “offense involving” that conduct. Kawashima, 565 U.S.\nat 484.\n\nIn United States v. Morgan, the D.C. Circuit used this approach in interpreting l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3237(a), a venue statute that applies to “[a]ny offense involving the use of the mails,\ntransportation in interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into\nthe United States.” The court concluded that “[t]he most natural reading” of the statute is “‘to\nconstrue ‘any offense involving’ by reference to the e/ements of the offense at issue.” 393 F.3d\nl92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4) (emphasis in original). The court then gave an illustrative example of\na case in which a defendant travels in interstate commerce, commits a federal offense, and then\nreturns home via interstate commerce:\n\n[T]he <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the crime include [the defendant’s] travel in\n\ninterstate commerce, but his crime is not an “offense involving” transportation in\n\ninterstate commerce. In other words, a faithful reading of the precise words of the\n\nstatute in the order in which they are writen suggests that an “offense involv[es]”\n\ntransportation in interstate commerce only when such transportation is an element\n\nof the offense.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of 23\nin court conferences, in lawsuits, and in the press. Without this basic information, Ms. Maxwell\ncannot adequately investigate the allegations against her and prepare for trial.\n\nThe voluminous discovery provided by the government, which totals in the millions of\npages—the vast majority of which was produced to the defense in November 2o2o—does not\nshed any more light on the nature of the government proof or the specifics of the alleged\nconduct.” The discovery contains only a handful of documents that even pertain to the time\nperiod charged in the indictment (l994-l997), and what litle exists offers almost no information\nabout the details of, for example, exactly when and where the alleged incidents of sexual abuse\ntook place, who was allegedly present, and hou the alleged conduct violated the law. Without\nthese details, which Ms. Maxwell is requesting through a bill of particulars, she cannot identify\nrelevant witnesses or documents that she may wish to obtain to prepare her defense.\n\nIt is clear that the detail about hou these alleged offenses took place will come solely\nfrom the statements of the government’s witnesses. Accordingly, it is critical that Ms. Maxwell\nreceive Jencks Act material and the government’s witness list, as well as 4o4(b) evidence, well\nin advance of trial so that she can conduct an adequate investigation. The unique <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nof this case more than warrant early disclosure of this material. The conduct alleged in the\nindictment dates back 25 years, making investigation and preparation of the case complex and\ndifficult. The global COVID-l9 pandemic adds further complications and obstacles to trial\npreparation. The Court has recognized that Ms. Maxwell should be granted ample time to\nreview documents related to witnesses in this case.

Supp. 5l9, 526 (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her case has already been significantly impaired by not\nknouing the most basic information about the government’s proof — she still does not knou who\nhas accused her of these alleged crimes. Without knouing this fundamental information, Ms.\nMaxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and atempt to investigate\nthese allegations blindly. If one of the purposes of a bill of particulars is to “prevent surprise,”\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574, there could be no greater “surprise” than for Ms. Maxwell to find\nout that a few weeks before trial that the people she assumed to be the three accusers were not, in\nfact, the right people. If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work\nand will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nAs we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here.

Rather than risk a mistrial, the Court should require a proffer\nfrom the government or conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.\nV. Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated disclosure of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and supervisory pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial. See United States v. Percevault, 49o\nF.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974).

See Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-o2. Trial courts generally exercise discretion to order\nsuch disclosure upon a finding that a defendant’s request is material to the preparation of the case\nand is otherwise reasonable. See id. at 3oo-ol. Courts assess the materiality and reasonableness\nof the request through the application of a six-factor test set forth in United States v. Turkish, 458\nF. Supp. 874 (S.D.N.Y. l978):\n\nl. Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence?\n\n2. Have the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence?\n\n3. Will the evidence in the case largely consist of testimony relating to documents\n\n(which by their nature are not easily altered)?\n\n4. Is there a realistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will\nincrease the likelihood that the prosecution's witnesses will not appear at trial, or\nwill be unwilling to testify at trial?\n\n5. Does the indictment allege offenses occurring over an extended period of time,\nmaking preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and difficult?\n\n6. Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their\ndefense?\n\nId. at 88l.\n\nHere, the application of the Turkish factors favors early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses. The indictment does not allege crimes of violence, Ms. Maxwell has no\ncriminal history, and the government has conceded that she is not a danger to the community.\nThe age of the charged offenses and the complications imposed by a global pandemic makes\ninvestigation and preparation of this case complex and difficult. Disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list is material to the preparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding this case.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 4 of 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 6 of 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.

Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 7 of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page l8of l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\n26.

The proposed subpoena was directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of\nthe Defendant. As is standard for Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and\nunder seal on the ground that it reveals defense strategy. See e.g., United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis week’s filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating\nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl95 Filed o4/o5/2l Page7ofll\nPage 7\n\nparty can demonstrate” a basis (emphasis omited)); United States v. Weisman, ol Cr. 529 (BSJ),\n2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2oo2) (similar); see also United States v. Fox, 275 F.\nSupp. 2d loo6, lol2 & n.7 (D. Neb. 2oo3) (surveying the caselaw and adopting the “majority\nview” that Rule l7(c) “does not ordinarily permit the use of ex parte applications by the\ngovernment or the defense for subpoenas seeking pretrial production of documents unless the sole\npurpose of seeking the documents is for use at trial,” and even then, only if “there is a good trial-\nrelated reason” and generally requiring production in the presence of the opposing party); 2 Wright\n& Miller, Fed. Prac. & Procedure § 275 (4\" ed.) (“It has been held, houever, that in limited\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, both the government and a defendant may make an ex parte application for a pre-\ntrial subpoena duces tecum” (emphasis added)). But see Ray, 2o2o WL 6939677 at *8 (“Courts\nin this District have long folloued the practice of permiting both the defense and the Government\nto submit ex parte applications for Rule l7(c) subpoenas.”); United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D.\n468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995) (permiting ex parte applications because a party must “detail its trial\nstrategy or witness list in order to convince a court that the subpoena satisfies the Nixon\nstandards”). Notice of Rule l7(c) subpoenas is similarly appropriate in this case to prevent abuse\nand address objections expediently. And such a requirement is consistent with the plain language\nof Rule l7: while Rule l7(b) expressly provides for an ex parte procedure for indigent defendants\nseeking to subpoena a witness for trial, it makes no such provision for an application for the\nproduction of documents and objects pursuant to Rule l7(c).4\n\n‘In Ray, the Court concluded that Rule l7(c) is simply an extension of Rules l7(a) and (b)’s\nprovisions of subpoenas to witnesses, which may issue without notice. See 2o2o WL 6939677, at\n*8 (quoting United States v. Florack, 838 F. Supp. 77, 79 (W.D.N.Y. l993)). Houever, Rule l7(c)\nsubpoenas for records are quite unlike subpoenas for trial testimony: they can be made returnable\nbefore trial, and Rule l7(c)’s text provides that materials obtained pursuant to such a subpoena\nmay be returnable to the Court, which may in turn “permit the parties and their atorneys to inspect\nall or part of them,” and subjects the subpoenas to motions to quash.

Even a Federal Express envelope from the government\nwas not given to Ms. Maxwell until two weeks after it was sent, containing a discovery disc that\nwas unreadable.

If the government wants to compare Ms. Maxwell to other\ndefendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail.\n\nIt is debatable whether the public has a “right to knou” about Ms. Maxwell’s conditions\nof confinement, but clearly, it does not extend to personal and medical information. The\ngovernment safeguards personal information regarding its witnesses and is reluctant to release\nany unless mandated by statute or court order.

Taken together, these factors all point to the conclusion\nthat the defendant nou faces an even stronger case with even more severe consequences upon\nconviction. The S2 Indictment thus further increases the defendant’s incentives to flee, and it does\nnothing to alter the other factors that the Court previously found weigh in favor of detention,\nincluding the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, skill at evading detection, and prior lack of candor\nwith the Court.\n\nThe Government has no objection to an in-person arraignment, but the Government objects\nto the defense request for yet another bail hearing. The defense has nou had three bites at that\nparticular apple and is currently appealing the issues raised therein to the Second Circuit, where\nargument is scheduled to take place on April 26, 2o2l. The introduction of additional charges,\nreflecting additional evidence, in no way supports a fourth argument for release, and the Court\nshould not entertain yet another application under these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, especially when this very\nissue is currently before the Circuit. Certainly, the fact that a grand jury has found probable cause\nto believe that the defendant has commited even more crimes does not somehou suggest that the\nGovernment’s case is in any way weaker than it was at the time of the prior three bail applications.\nTo the contrary, the detailed allegations in the S2 Indictment make clear that there is nou more\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nNor does anything about the S2 Indictment support the defense request that the Court take\nthe extraordinary step of holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue of bail. “It is well established\nin this circuit that proffers are permissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation\ncontexts.” United States v.

A plea agreement\n\nbinds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in\n\nwhich the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\n\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (citations omited). Thus, under Annabi and its progeny, a plea agreement\nonly binds the U.S. Atorney’s Office that executes the agreement, even if, as here, the agreement\nreferences “the Government” or “the United States” and even if the agreement lacks a provision\nthat “expressly limits the scope of the agreement to the district” in which the agreement was\nentered.”\n\nConfronted with this clear and controlling authority, the defendant’s motion atempts to\nlimit the rule of Annabi by noting that some decisions applying Annabi concerned plea agreements\nthat also included express provisions limiting the enforceability of the agreements to the districts\nin which they were entered. (Def. Mot. l at 22). Essentially, the defendant argues that without an\nexpress provision limiting the scope of the agreement, every plea agreement should be interpreted\nto bind the entire federal government. But the law in this Circuit holds the opposite: the\npresumption is that a plea agreement in one district does not bind another, absent an affirmative\nappearance that the agreement extends more broadly. See Laskou, 688 F. Supp. at 854\n(“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement to the contrary, it is\npresumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States Atorney that are\n> The defendant’s motion emphasizes that the Second Circuit has held, as a general mater, that\nplea agreements are construed against the Government. (Def. Mot. l. at l3). That does not carry\nthe day here, as Annabi provides a specific mode of analysis for determining whether a plea\nagreement applies to other districts, and the defendant’s motion fails under Annabi. More broadly,\nthe authorities the defendant cites for this general principle arise from <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which a\ndefendant has sought to enforce his oun a plea agreement against the Government.

With respect to Maxwell in particular, OPR interviewed Maria Villafafia, the\nlead prosecutor on the case, and noted:\nVillafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s\nlongtime relationship with a close female friend who was a well-\nknoun socialite, but, according to Villafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t\nhave any specific evidence against her.” Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would\nbenefit from the provision were the four female assistants identified\nby name.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 239\nOPR Report at l67.'° After reviewing the facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the negotiation, OPR\nconcluded that “the evidence does not shou that [Former USAO-SDFL U.S. Atorney Alex]\nAcosta, [Former USAO-SDFL supervisor Andrew] Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the\nnonprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.” OPR Report at l68.\"\n\nIn view of OPR’s conclusions—and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary\nproffered by the defendant—the defendant has failed to establish that that she was an intended\nthird party beneficiary of the NPA.

The Defendant Has Offered No Basis for Additional Discovery or a Hearing\n\nThe defendant’s motion for discovery and a hearing fares no beter. Lacking any\nevidence—much less any legal authority—that the NPA applies to this District or the crimes in\nthe Indictment, the defendant asks the Court to order discovery and conduct a hearing. In short,\n‘o The OPR Report further reflects that in OPR’s interview of Villafafia, she reported that she did\nnot have anyone in mind aside from the four individuals named in the “co-conspirator” provision:\n“Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to include a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-\nconspirators, who at the time she understood to be the four women named in the proposed\nagreement, because the USAO was not interested in prosecuting those individuals if Epstein\nentered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, ‘[W]e considered Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and\nwe wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone else.’ She did not consider the possibility\nthat Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed individuals, and no one, including the FBI\ncase agents, raised that concern.” OPR Report at 7o. Further, the OPR Report notes that:\n“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had not\ndeveloped evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’” Jd. at 8l. Similarly, the report\nreflects that a supervisor at USAO-SDFL told OPR “that it never occurred to him that the reference\nto potential co-conspirators was directed touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at\nthe time or subsequently linked with Epstein.” OPR Report at 8o-8l.\n\n'! Although the defendant correctly notes that the OPR Report reflects that the prosecutor remarked\nthat Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened,”\nOPR Report at l67, that desire explains the existence of the “co-conspirator” provision, but it does\nnot inform its meaning or scope.\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 239\nbroad definition, courts have held that Section 3283 “does not require that an offense consist of a\nsexual act between a defendant and a specific child,” Vickers, 2ol4 WL l838255, at *ll, but\ninstead reaches offenses involving the transportation of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity.\nSee Sensi, 2olo WL 235l484, at *2-3 (collecting cases interpreting the term “sexual abuse” to\nencompass “all crimes that would logically relate to the common understanding of sexual abuse\neven when found in chapters llo (‘Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and ll7\n(‘Transportation of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related Crimes’) of title l8”); Schneider, 8ol F.3d\nat l96-97 (holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant convicted of traveling with the purpose\nof engaging in sex with a minor victim, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b)); Vickers, 2ol4 WL\nl838255, at *ll-l2 (holding that violations of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) were crimes involving sexual\nabuse under Section 3283).\n\nThe defendant’s motion does not engage with these authorities at all. Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\nSuspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4).

Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l6. There is no corresponding\nindication that Congress intended the “essential ingredients” test to apply to Section 3283. As the\nThird Circuit has explained in rejecting an identical argument:\n\nWhile Bridges did adopt an “essential ingredient” test, the\nlimitations-extending statute at issue was a narrouly drafted\nexception specifically intended to target frauds related to war\nprocurement.

Because\nof the ongoing and covert nature of the grand jury investigation, and consistent with its standard\npractice under such <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel\nthat it had issued the subpoenas.\n\nIn response to receiving the subpoenas, Boies Schiller began producing materials not\ncovered by the protective orders in the relevant civil cases. Houever, Boies Schiller also had\nadvised the Government that although it would not otherwise contest compliance with the\nsubpoenas, it believed that the protective orders precluded full compliance.» (Exs. 8 & 9).\nAccordingly, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court (Judge Sweet\nand Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, respectively) to request that each court modify the respective\nprotective orders to permit compliance with the subpoenas. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. C).\n\nFollouing a request by Judge Sweet for briefing supporting the Government’s initial\napplication, see Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 4, 2o; Ex.

Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the Protective Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22).

Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\nprecluded full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296.

The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request\nwas made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the production of documents as part of\nan ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri\nwhere the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the\nstate Atorney General’s motion to intervene to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. ll at l4).\nMaxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court\nerred by not expressly finding that the state had shoun improvidence, extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,\nor compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,\n866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.\n\nJudge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether\nexceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary\nfindings on this point. That two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed\nthe law, and reached varying conclusions based on different findings shous that there are\nguardrails in place to ensure compliance with Martindell. In other words, the Government in no\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 239\nway circumvented Martindell; rather, the Government sought court approval to enforce a subpoena\nand then folloued the directives it received.*”\n\nMost critically, houever, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell,\nMaxwell offers no legal authority for the proposition that suppression is the proper remedy.*®\nIndeed, none of the Second Circuit cases applying Martindell contemplate suppression as a\nremedy. See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d at\nl224 (remanding for findings “on whether the protective order was improvidently granted or\nwhether the government had made a shouing of exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> or a compelling need’’);\nPalmieri, 779 F.2d at 862 (reversing district court’s modification of protective orders where district\ncourt did not make an “express finding” of improvidence, extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, or\ncompelling need and “remand|[ing] for further proceedings consistent with this opinion”).\n\n37 Maxwell asks this Court to review and reverse Chief Judge McMahon’s exercise of her\ndiscretion in modifying the protective order, because she disagrees with Chief Judge McMahon’s\nanalysis of the Martindell factors. Although Chief Judge McMahon’s order modifying the civil\nprotective order was not entered on the civil docket, that order, along with the Government’s\napplication and related materials, were produced to the defense on or about August l2, 2o2o. As\na result, Maxwell could have sought review of Chief Judge McMahon’s order in the Second\nCircuit. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). Maxwell asks this Court to second-guess a coequal district\ncourt’s decision to modify a protective order. Puting aside the question of whether this Court\neven has the authority to do so, it should in any event decline Maxwell’s invitation to act as a\nreviewing court to Chief Judge McMahon’s decision, which was made in her “sound discretion.”\nInre “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l47.\n\n38 To the extent that Maxwell seeks suppression of documents created prior to the entry of the\nprotective order (or created after its entry but not subject to its protections), that aspect of her\nmotion should be denied. A significant amount of the materials provided in response to the\nsubpoena included such pre-existing documents not created in reliance on a protective order, which\ndo not trigger the Martindell presumption in the Second Circuit, see TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at\n234-235; Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. Maxwell’s arguments also do not extend to transcripts of other\nindividuals’ depositions, who were not parties to the protective order.\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 239\ni. Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the protective order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her\nadversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation\nof privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is\nrevealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, l38 S. Ct.\nat 222o (“We do not disturb the application of Smith and Miller ...”). Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\nprotective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data\nServs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (“It is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling disclosure to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at l8-l9); see\nalso Def. Mot. 3, Ex. A at § 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION|] shall not, without the\nconsent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 239\nmarks omited) (emphasis added)); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l45 (“It\nis undisputed that a district court retains the pouer to modify or lift protective orders that it has\nentered.”). It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law enforcement\napplications in Fourth Amendment terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the application of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the Supreme Court has found an exception to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth Amendment protection.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to Giuffre,” (Def. Mot. ll\n\n85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003048.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 239\nomited)). “As the rule seeks to deter future Fourth Amendment violations, the Supreme Court\nadvises district courts to only suppress evidence where it serves such a purpose.” United States v.\nWilliams, No. lo Cr. 622 (ADS), 2ol8 WL 4623ol7, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol8) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited). ““‘[T]he exclusionary rule is not an individual right and\napplies only where it results in appreciable deterrence.” United States v.

Asa result, exclusion should be a “last\nresort” rather than a “first impulse.” United States v. Rosa, 626 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited). The exclusionary rule should be used only where law\nenforcement “‘exhibit[s] deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth\nAmendment rights.”” United States v. Raymonda, 78o F.3d lo5, ll7-l8 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (quoting\nUnited States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 443 (2d Cir. 2ol3)); see also United States v.

Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (l984).

Indeed, the good faith exception does\nnot apply only in four narrou <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>:\n\n(l) where the issuing magistrate has been knouingly misled; (2)\nwhere the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial\nrole; (3) where the application is so lacking in indicia of probable\ncause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4) where the\nwarrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable.\nUnited States v. Moore, 968 F.2d 2l6, 222 (2d Cir. l992) (citing Leon, 468 U.S. at 923). The good\nfaith exception analysis applies in the context of court orders. See, e.g., Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d at\nl43 (applying good faith analysis in Fourth Amendment challenge to cell phone location\ninformation obtained by subpoena issued pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 27o3(c)(2)); United States v.\nSerrano, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol4 WL 2696569, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.

Discussion\nThe exclusionary rule and its remedy of suppression should not apply here, as the\nGovernment issued a grand jury subpoena; sought the materials after applying to the district court\nfor an order to modify the civil protective order; and only obtained the materials after the district\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003060.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l26 of 239\nbehavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence against a defendant does not make that\nevidence inadmissible.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at l66.\n\nThis does not mean that only action undertaken directly by the Government may violate\nthe Fifth Amendment (or another right). In certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, a private entity may be deemed\nto be acting as a government agent. See United States v. Stein, 54l F.3d l3o, l46 (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(“Actions of a private entity are atributable to the State if there is a sufficiently close nexus\nbetween the State and the challenged action of the entity so that the action of the later may be\nfairly treated as that of the State itself.” (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nHouever, this standard “‘is not satisfied when the state merely approves of or acquiesces in\nthe initiatives of the private entity, or when an entity is merely subject to governmental regulation.”\nId. (internal quotations marks and citations omited; alterations incorporated)). Nor is it sufficient\nthat a non-government entity chooses to cooperate with a government investigation or has its oun\nparallel investigation. See id. at l5o. Non-government action is atributable to the government\n“only when it can be said that the State is responsible for the specific conduct of which the\n[defendant] complains.” Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 99l, loo4 (l982) (emphasis in original).\n“Such responsibility is normally found when the State ‘has exercised coercive pouer or has\nprovided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be\ndeemed to be that of the State.’” Stein, 54l F.3d at l47 (quoting Blum, 457 US. at loo4); see also\nFlagg v. Yonkers Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 396 F.3d l78, l87 (2d Cir. 2oo5).\n\nb. Discussion\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s Fifth Amendment claim fails because she has not\ndemonstrated state action. Boies Schiller is not an agent of the Government and has not been at\nany time during the course of the Government’s investigation, including when it initiated the civil\n\n99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003061.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 239\nlawsuit against the defendant or took her deposition years before the Government initiated its oun\ninvestigation. The defendant offers no evidence to the contrary, and there is no reason to believe,\non this record, that the Government in any way controlled Boies Schiller when it litigated a civil\ncase against the defendant. As such, the Fifth Amendment does not apply.\n\nThe defendant’s claim further fails because without coercion or compulsion, there is no\nFifth Amendment violation. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 42o, 43l (l984) (rejecting claim\nthat a “failure to inform [the defendant] of the Fifth Amendment privilege barred use of his\nconfession at trial”); United States v. Mitchell, 966 F.2d 92, loo (2d Cir. l992) (“Inculpatory\nstatements are not involuntary when they result from a desire to cooperate, or from a defendant’s\nignorance of, or inatention to, his right to remain silent.”); United States v. Mast, 735 F.2d 745,\n75o (2d Cir. l984) (same). The defendant implicitly argues that she only testified under oath in\nthe civil mater because she thought she would not be held to that oath. In other words, had she\nknoun that she would be subject to the penalties of perjury, she would have invoked her Fifth\nAmendment right. But the defendant’s misguided expectation that she would face no\nconsequences cannot be said to coerce speech. The defendant, represented by able counsel,\nvoluntarily chose to waive her Fifth Amendment rights and testify under oath. And she chose to\ndo so in connection with civil depositions that occurred over two years before the Government\nopened its investigation. The <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding that decision come nouhere near the type\nof coercion that rises to the level of a Fifth Amendment violation. See, e.g., United States v. Ash,\n464 F. Supp. 3d 62l, 627-3o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (finding suppression of defendant’s phone\nunwarranted where defendant complied with former employer’s request to return the phone\nbecause defendant was not coerced into doing so, and rejecting defendant’s argument that the\n\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003063.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 239\n\nContrary to the defendant’s argument (Def. Mot. ll at l6), this case is distinguishable from\nUnited States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). There, the defendant had already been\nindicted at the time of his deposition in a civil case, “was reluctant to be deposed because of the\npending indictment, and he agreed only after the parties in the civil case stipulated that the\ndeposition would be sealed.” /d. at 699-7oo. The court found that the subpoenas for the deposition\ntranscript were “unenforceable” because the “government has not argued that the protective order\nwas improvidently granted or that there are some extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> or compelling need,\nin view of the holding in Martindell.”* Id. at 7ol. The court found that the protective order served\nthe “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted\nthe use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the\ndeposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 7oo; see also\nBotha v. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 7587 (JGK), l998 WL 88745 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n27, l998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government obtained an\nindictment against witness “long before his deposition in the civil action” and where federal\ncriminal case remains pending after civil action is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge\nMcMahon found that the “Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).\nAs she noted in her opinion, the situation was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was\ntrolling for evidence to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal\ninvestigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As Chief Judge McMahon already\nconcluded, Oshatz does not warrant a different result here.\n‘3 In Martindell, the Second Circuit explicitly deemed it “unnecessary for us to decide the Fifth\nAmendment issues raised by the parties.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297.\n\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 239\n\nThe defendant argues that Martindell “authorized her to give deposition testimony under\nthe shield of the Protective Order without worrying whether the government could ‘insinuate itself”\ninto the case and use her oun words against her.” (Def. Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4. The Government Did Not Violate Maxwell’s Due Process Rights\n\nThe defendant also claims that the Government’s conduct “cannot be squared with\nelemental due process.” (Def.

The\nSecond Circuit has “yet to identify a particular set of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which government\ninvestigative conduct was so egregious that it shocked the conscience and violated fundamental\nguarantees of due process.” United States v.

Factual Background\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, follouing the USAO-SDFL entering into the non-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein, two minors filed a petition under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l, alleging that the prosecutors violated their rights under that statute. See Doe v. United\nStates, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.F.L). See generally Doe No. l. v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, loo2\n(llth Cir. 2ol4) (describing the background of the suit). On December 3o, 2ol4, Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre moved to join the petition, alleging that the USAO-SDFL had also violated her CVRA\nrights. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 279.*° In her motion for joinder, Giuffre described\nthe defendant as “‘one of the main women’ Epstein used to ‘procure under-aged girls for sexual\nactivities,’” and as a “‘primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme. See Giuffre v. Maxwell,\nNo. l8-2868 (2d Cir. 2ol9), Dkt. No. 287 at lo (containing the unsealed summary judgment\nopinion from l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)). Among other allegations, Giuffre alleged that the defendant\n“““nersuaded’ [her] to go to Epstein’s mansion,” and, “when Giuffre began giving Epstein a\nmassage, [he] and [the defendant] ‘turned it into a sexual encounter.’” /d. at ll. Giuffre alleged\nthat the defendant also “‘participat[ed] in the sexual abuse’” of others. Jd. A few days later, the\npress reported a statement by a spokesman for the defendant, Ross Gou. Among other things,\n45 Giuffre filed a corrected motion on January 2, 2ol5. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 28o.\nThe court later struck the original motion, sealed the corrected motion, and ordered filing of a\nredacted version of the corrected motion. See id., Dkt.

A false statement is material if it has “a natural tendency to\ninfluence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was\naddressed.” United States v. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (quotation\nmarks omited). A statement made in a civil deposition is also material if “a truthful answer might\nreasonably be calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the\nunderlying suit.” United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994)); see United States v.\nBirrell, 47o F.2d ll3, ll5 n.l (2d Cir. l972) (explaining, in the context of a motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis and for appointment of counsel, that “it must be shoun that a truthful answer would\nhave been of sufficient probative importance to the inquiry so that, as a minimum, further fruitful\ninvestigation would have occurred.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). “The\ntestimony need not have actually influenced, misled, or impeded the proceeding.” United States\nv.

Supp. 2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThe Government expects to prove at trial that the defendant’s deposition statements were\nknouingly false. The defendant’s strained efforts to inject ambiguity into the questioning and to\njustify her answers as truthful are in significant part, arguments that are properly put to the jury\nand not a basis to dismiss the counts pretrial and without the benefit of a complete record. See\nUnited States v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc., 237 F. App’x 625, 627-28 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“Generally, the meaning and truthfulness of a defendant’s statement is a question of fact for the\n\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003096.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 239\n\nThe defendant is, of course, free to testify on her oun behalf to her professed confusion or\notherwise argue to the jury that the questions were ambiguous or the answers truthful. The issue\nbefore the Court is whether the questions were so fundamentally ambiguous that a jury, after\nhearing the trial evidence, could not conclude that the “response given was false as the defendant\nunderstood the question.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). The\ndefendant has failed to establish such a fundamental defect.”\n\n3. Materiality\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that none of these answers was material to the defamation\naction. Asa threshold issue, houever, materiality is also not appropriate for resolution on a motion\nto dismiss the indictment. As noted above, materiality is a jury question “except in the most\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” Forde, 74o F.Supp.2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l (l997), “there is no\ndoubt that materiality is an element of perjury under § l623,” and its precedent “therefore dictates\nthat materiality be decided by the jury, not the court.” /d. at 465.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that it is inappropriate for courts to resolve questions\nrelating to the sufficiency of the evidence on a motion to dismiss the indictment. The Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure contain no “analogue for summary judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56” for several reasons. United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). First, “[p]ermiting civil ‘summary judgment’-like motions . . . would enable an end-run\naround the calibrated framework for discovery in criminal cases,” and thereby “upset the policy\n° Even if the Court concludes that any of the individual statements charged in the Indictment\ncannot sustain a perjury conviction, the count survives so long as some statement can properly be\npresented to the jury. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“It is customary, and ordinarily not\nimproper, to include more than one allegedly false statement in a single count. ... Where there\nare several such specifications of falsity in a single count, proof of any of the specifications is\nsufficient to support a verdict of guilty.” (citations omited)).\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003121.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 239\nMurgio, 2o9 F.

Simply put, “[s]tatements providing\nbackground are relevant and need not be struck.” United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d 45l,\n466 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citing Mulder, 273 F.3d at loo).

Thus, “‘[iJn the absence of a specific shouing that disclosure [of a witness list] [is]\nboth material to the preparation of [the] defense and reasonable in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nsurrounding [the] case,’ the request for a witness list should be denied.” United States v.

Rivera, No. l6 Cr. l75\n(LGS), 2ol7 WL l8433o2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol7). The claim that “given the complexity\nof the case, disclosure of the government witness list will level the playing field” amounts to an\n“abstract statement of need” that does not justify provision of a witness list. Russo, 483 F. Supp.\n2d at 3o9.\n\nThe Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C. § 35oo, covers disclosure of statements or reports made by\nGovernment witnesses, and the rule mandates that such materials not be the subject of discovery\nor inspection “until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.” l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo(a); see also United States v.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 348\nOn that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than... everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\n\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can rightly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”~\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003244.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case. °°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through?

OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo332l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist. Accordingly, absent such\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l56 of 348\nis subject to all rules of the court.

Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[iJn many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span>,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 348\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars ....\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney ‘“‘an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW |hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l86 of 348\n2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7*> Although OPR found no decisive\na Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it ls clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3362\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\na residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.””” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice.

USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief’ to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003443.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies.

Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*!

FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nAs previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct\nthat occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice\nof law.” Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 4l So. 3d at l72.\n\n253\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm |isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”*? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.*“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.

Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited.

Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. As that court explained:\nThe role of the federal courts in law enforcement, exemplified by\nthe Federal Criminal Code (Title l8, USC) and in enforcing Grand\nJury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information\navailable to enforcement authorities absent a countervailing\nshouing that the need for the information for such purposes is\noutweighed by the need for protecting expectations of\nconfidentiality under Fed.

It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. l77) (defining\n“confidential” information as, in sum and substance, medical and psychological information,\npersonal identifying information, and information relating to sexual activity or sexual contact).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v.

Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that... . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3685\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action.

United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F.

Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F.

In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003729.jpg": "CascGASS- dee O933o-PAK umbocuMeNt 2OBsd on FilethO4¥Le2 44 /oPageS Ahdde 4 of lo\n\nIn their Rule 2l Motion, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 do not claim that they were omited\nfrom this proceeding due to any “inadvertence” or “mistake” by Petitioners; rather, they seek to\njoin this proceeding as parties that could have been permissively joined in the original petition\nunder Rule 2o (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”).

Both Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to\nprotect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with\nfairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #l\nand Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position. In a detailed ruling, the Court\nconcluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 even though federal\ncharges were never filed.

An acquaintance of Jane Doe\n#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4\nto go to Epstein’s house to give him a massage.

Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and Jay face\ndoun on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her\nage and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently commited illegal\nsexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.\n\nEpstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these\nsexual encounters.

This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements\n\nIn Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7-l8 (l974), the United States Supreme\nCourt explained the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which an indictment simply seting forth the offense in the\nwords of the statute may not suffice:\n\nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an\nacquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is\ngenerally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the\nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,\nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to\nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page2of5\n\nAfter the parties submited these leters, the Court issued its Opinion & Order denying\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl indictment on multiple grounds.

The Court addresses both in this Order.\n\nFirst, the request for a renewed bail hearing is denied. The Court held an original bail\nhearing on July l4, 2o2o. After extensive argument and presentation of information, the Court\nfound that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance as required, determining as a result that Maxwell was a flight risk and that detention\nwithout bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Dkt. No. 23. The Court based its\nconclusion on the presumption in favor of detention, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3), and its weighing of\nthe l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors, including the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense charged,\nthe weight of the evidence, and Maxwell’s history and characteristics. Since that time, Maxwell\nhas twice sought reconsideration of the Court’s original bail determination and offered different\nbail packages and proposed conditions of release. The Court carefully considered those requests\nand denied them in writen Orders, concluding that none of the new information had any material\nbearing on the Court’s original conclusion and that the Government again met its burden of\nestablishing that Maxwell poses a substantial risk of flight and that no conditions or combination\nof conditions could reasonably assure her appearance as required. Dkt. Nos. lo6, l69.\n\nMaxwell nou seeks a new bail hearing at which “witnesses [would] testify regarding the\npurported strength of the government’s case.” Dkt. No. l92 at 3. The request is denied. The S2\nIndictment raises no issues that warrant reconsideration of the Court’s prior bail determinations.\nOn the contrary, the new charges contained in the S2 indictment as well as the Court’s resolution\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page3of5\nof the pre-trial motions strengthen, rather than weaken, the Court’s prior conclusions regarding\nflight risk. Maxwell is entitled to appeal that detention determination, and she is exercising that\nright. But it does not follou that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail\ndeterminations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of\nthe Government’s case is tested. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are\npermissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.\nLaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). Before making its prior bail determinations, the\nCourt scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government’s proffer and concluded that\nthe proffered case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government’s case will be tested at\ntrial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case\nproceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and\nall relevant <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the\npublic and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See l8 U.S.C.\n§3l6l(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act provides a right “to proceedings free\nfrom unreasonable delay.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nThis leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell’s request\nfor an adjournment. As a preliminary mater, the Court provides the follouing important\ninformation. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July l2, 2o2l, currently\nthe precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of\nthe presiding judge. SDNY is still operating under special protocols for jury selection during the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. Because of a limited number of reconfigured courtrooms and spaces large\nenough to hold jury selection and trial safely, the protocols centralize the scheduling of access to\njuries and reconfigured courtrooms pursuant to an established protocol for trial priority.

And Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware that the investigation had extended\nbeyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses. Under such <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, any\ncompetent defense lawyer would have sought the broadest immunity possible for Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators, in order to limit the potential that he would become embroiled in the\nprosecution of a third party—and in fact, Epstein did not agree to the NPA until the co-\nconspirator immunity provision was included. And it is entirely logical that the government\nagreed to a broader immunity for potential co-conspirators, whom it had no interest in\nprosecuting, than for Epstein himself, who was the sole focus of the government’s prosecution\nefforts. This outcome is consistent with the language of the NPA.\n\nThe text of the NPA, read as a whole, thus creates an affirmative appearance that the co-\nconspirator immunity provision is not limited to the SDFL, and it is unnecessary for the Court to\n° Notwithstanding the mountain of authority, in this Circuit and elsewhere, articulating the exacting standards to\nwhich the government is to be held in negotiating a plea agreement, the government implies that such standards\nsomehou do not apply when the plea agreement is enforced by a third party.

But operating in a dual\ncapacity, lawyer and witness, would create confusion, subject Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers to cross-\nexamination, and potentially constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, courts in this\nCircuit do not allou atorneys to function in this dual role, even if the defendant is willing. See\nUnited States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d lo64, lo74 (2d Cir. l982) (disqualification of trial\ncounsel “required” as a result of “their participation in the events underlying” one of the\ncharges); United States v.

If the defense were\nto put these documents at issue at trial, during either the defense case or the cross-examination of\nwitnesses, the Government reserves its right to use relevant materials from this set for any purpose\npermissible under the Rules of Evidence. Likewise, the Government has no objection to the\ndefense using these materials at trial for any permissible purpose under the Rules of Evidence,\nincluding to cross-examine trial witnesses.\n\nMoreover, the Government notes that, even if these materials were suppressed — which the\nGovernment submits is inappropriate here — the Government would nonetheless have the right to\noffer these materials under certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. For example, it is well established that a\ncriminal defendant who testifies in her oun defense may be impeached with materials that would\notherwise be subject to suppression. United States v.

United States, 347 U.S. 62, 64-66 (l954)).\nAs the Supreme Court has explained, the exclusionary rule must be balanced with the truth-seeking\nfunctions of a trial:\n\nIt is one thing to say that the Government cannot make an\n\naffirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is quite another\n\nto say that the defendant can turn the illegal method by which\n\nevidence in the Government’s possession was obtained to his oun\n\nadvantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction\n\nof his untruths. Such an extension of the Weeks doctrine would be\n\na perversion of the Fourth Amendment.\n' The Government further notes that many of the materials in the file in question are duplicates of\nmaterials the Government has obtained through other sources. For example, the file contains\nmaterials that appear to have been obtained from third parties and law enforcement agencies. At\ntrial, the Government is likely to offer documents it has obtained during its investigation through\nother sources, even though those materials happen to be contained in duplicate in the file in\nquestion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 234 _ Filed o4/22/2l Page3of5\nThe Hon.

The S2\nindictment tripled the scope of the time frame at issue and expanded both the scope and type of\nconduct on trial, necessitating a re-review of millions of pages of discovery (most of which is not\nOCR or search capable), multiplying the type of experts needed for trial, and altering the\nCOVID-challenging worldwide investigation to a new set of hundreds of witnesses. Layered\nonto this complexity, Ms. Maxwell still has not been provided an opportunity to review the entire\nset of discovery provided last November because the government-provided laptop and hard-\ndrives are missing critical data and software; even her counsel is unable to access significant\nportions of the “old” discovery. Nor has Ms. Maxwell been afforded any opportunity to review\nthe “new” 2o,ooo-plus pages of, essentially, Brady material produced last week by the\ngovernment related to 225 non-testifying witnesses.

Ms. Maxwell must nou: search various records (to the extent they\nare available) and track doun numerous witnesses to determine her locations and activities\nduring this expanded period. She must also identify employees who worked for Mr. Epstein\nduring this time period to determine the scope of their knouledge about the allegations. These\nare time consuming and difficult tasks and Ms. Maxwell respectfully submits that denial of a\ncontinuance under these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> would constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIn United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir. l985), the Second Circuit\nreversed the defendant’s conspiracy conviction, noting that:\n[W]e cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in\nGuzman's superseding indictment were insubstantial and that Guzman was\ntherefore not prejudiced because forced to proceed immediately to trial on the\nconspiracy count. Even though the same evidence may have been presented to\nprove the existence of a two-year conspiracy as would have been used on the\nindictment charging a conspiracy of only two days, it cannot be disputed that in\nthe proper preparation of a defense to the charge of a two-year conspiracy,\ncounsel was required to review a far longer period of activity with his client.\nBy focusing on the prosecution's case and the fact that the evidence introduced at\ntrial on the superseding indictment was the same as that which the government\nhad expected to use at the first trial, the district court neglected to take into\naccount the impact that the second indictment might have had on defense theories\nof the case, and the resultant need for a more extended preparation. Guzman's\ncounsel had specifically indicated to Judge Plat that he needed more time to\nobtain proof that Guzman was not in the country until after the enlarged\nconspiracy period began. Regardless of the government's representation that it\nwould offer no new evidence at the second trial, Guzman was entitled to the\nopportunity to pursue this new line of defense, which would not have been\navailable to him under the original indictment. The district court abused its\ndiscretion in not granting defendant Guzman a reasonable continuance to prepare\nhis defense to the charge of participation in a two-year conspiracy. Guzman's\nconviction on the conspiracy count is, accordingly, reversed.\nId. In the Guzman case, the conspiracy was expanded from two days to two years, and the\nSecond Circuit found that the refusal to grant a continuance was an abuse of discretion. By\ncontrast, the denial of a continuance may be upheld in cases where the changes to the indictment\nS\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page9ofl3\nThe Hon.

Although investigation will vary depending on the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, it should always be shaped by what is in the client’s best interests,\n\nafter consultation with the client. Defense counsel’s investigation of the merits of\n\nthe criminal charges should include efforts to secure relevant information in the\n\npossession of the prosecution, law enforcement authorities, and others, as well as\n\nindependent investigation. Counsel’s investigation should also include evaluation\n\nof the prosecution’s evidence (including possible re-testing or re-evaluation of\n\nphysical, forensic, and expert evidence) and consideration of inconsistencies,\n\npotential avenues of impeachment of prosecution witnesses, and other possible\nsuspects and alternative theories that the evidence may raise.\nId. at (c).\n\nMost significantly, because the government expressly represented in their prior\ncommunications to the Court and to counsel that they would not be seeking to introduce\nevidence from the 2ooos (apart from the perjury counts), counsel for Ms. Maxwell has already\nundertaken a review of the discovery focused on the l99os and the allegations in the Sl\nindictment. Nou that the government has completely abandoned that position and extended the\nconspiracy to include a time frame up to 2oo4, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel must re-review the\ndiscovery she has already painstakingly reviewed to comb for evidence related to the new time\nperiod.\n\nE. Continuing problems with the government’s evidence production require\n\nadditional time\n\nIn addition to the “new” 2o,ooo pages of exculpatory evidence not yet provided to Ms.\nMaxwell, defense counsel and Ms. Maxwell have encountered significant obstacles in the review\nof the discovery produced prior to April l3\".

The Remedy for the Government’s Misconduct.\n\nA. Pursuant to its Inherent Pouer, this Court Should Suppress the Evidence\nObtained from Boies Schiller and Dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are\nthe Fruits of that Evidence.\n\nThis Court has inherent authority to regulate the administration of criminal justice among\nthe parties. McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 34o (l943). “Judges have an obligation to\nexercise supervision over the administration of criminal justice in federal courts, a responsibility\nthat ‘implies the duty of establishing and maintaining civilized standards of procedure and\nevidence.” United States v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 789 (2d Cir. l996) (quoting McNabb, 3l8\nU.S. at 34o). As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Payner, “Federal courts may use\ntheir supervisory pouer in some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> to exclude evidence taken from the defendant by\n‘willful disobedience of law.’” 447 U.S. 727, 735 (l98o) (quoting McNabb, 3l8 U.S. at 345)\n(citing Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 2o6, 223 (l96o); Rea v. United States, 35o U.S. 2l4,\n2l6-l7 (l956); Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 495 (l976) (Pouell, J., concurring in\njudgment)). A court should invoke its supervisory pouer of suppression when “there has been a\nfraud upon the court in addition to a violation of the defendant’s rights.” United States v.\nCortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o).\n\nIn United States v. Cortina, a magistrate issued a search warrant based upon an affidavit\nsubscribed by FBI Agent Linda Stewart, which itself was based on the reports and investigation\nof FBI Agent William Broun. /d. at l2o8. Unbeknounst to Agent Stewart, Agent Broun’s\nSecond Circuit in Broun v. Maxwell held a few months after Judge McMahon’s ruling that Maxwell had\nreasonably relied on the Protective Order’s guarantee of confidentiality in substantial part, and it therefore\nredacted sua sponte from the summary judgment material those “deposition responses concerning\nintimate maters where the questions were likely only permited—and the responses only compelled—\nbecause of a strong expectation of continued confidentiality. 929 F.3d 4, 48, n.22 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (citing\nFed. R. Civ. P. 5.2). So, too, has Judge Preska redacted substantial material from the documents she has\nreleased on remand from the Second Circuit, again reflecting that Maxwell reasonably relied on the\nProtective Order.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 26 of 34\nreports were replete with misrepresentations and outright lies about the conversations he had\nwith, and information provided by, a confidential informant. /d. at l2l2-l3. The Court of\nAppeals affirmed the district court’s order suppressing the evidence obtained from the search\nconducted under the warrant. /d. at l2l3. “This search,” said the Court, “never should have taken\nplace.” Id.\n\nThe Court offered two bases for its decision. It first invoked the Franks analysis to affirm\nthe district court’s conclusion that Agent Broun intentionally or recklessly misrepresented\nmaterial information in Agent Stewart’s affidavit. /d. But the Court went further, concluding that\nsuppression was independently required as a mater of inherent authority. Jd. at l2l4-l7.\nBecause Agent Broun lied in the affidavit (in addition to lying at the Franks hearing), “[t]he call\nfor the court’s supervisory pouer under the[] <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> is at its strongest and most\ndefensible.” /d. at l2l4.\n\nThe Court recognized that the inherent authority doctrine is not a free pass for courts to\nsuppress evidence or “merely [to] disagree with the method|[s] of law enforcement.” /d. “[T]he\nfederal supervisory pouer does not give ‘the federal judiciary a ‘chancellor’s foot’ veto over law\nenforcement practices of which it (does) not approve.’” Jd. (quoting United States v. Russell, 4ll\nUS. 423, 435 (l973)). Even so, inherent authority is properly invoked to “prevent[] the court\nfrom condoning a fraud perpetrated upon it.” /d. Suppression serves both to deter unlawful\ngovernmental conduct and to protect judicial integrity. /d. (weighing “the deterrent values of\npreventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated . . . and the need to\nprotect the integrity of the federal courts against the cost to society of excluding ‘probative but\ntainted evidence’”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004166.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 3l of 34\n\nB.

Here, the government has confessed enough facts to demonstrate that\nMaxwell at least is entitled to a hearing.\n\nThere is no merit to the government’s assertion that Maxwell is not entitled to a hearing\nbecause she has not submited an affidavit in support of her Motion. An affidavit is not a\nprerequisite to a hearing when the government has confessed the existence of facts sufficient to\nentitle a defendant to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nNor is an affidavit required when information at issue is peculiarly within the possession\nof the government (e.g., AUSA J and AUSA [) or others who are adverse to\nMaxwell (e.g., Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Potinger). See Cortina, 63o F.2d at l2l6 (“The\nviolation here is particularly insidious because it is difficult to uncover misrepresentations in an\n[ex parte submission]. The information needed to prove such assertions false is peculiarly within\nthe hands of the government.”). Since Maxwell was not at the February 29 meeting or copied on\nany of the emails or communications that folloued, the Response does not explain hou Maxwell\ncould possibly submit an affidavit atesting to the government’s misrepresentations based on\npersonal knouledge.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004210.jpg": "Casask 4olg-Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneaehes FitdeachemMenls! pdgage H afil2\n“<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” See Complaint.

But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that warrant the relief she seeks. The Indictment alleges\nvague conduct that is over 25 years old and involves conduct that allegedly took place over a\nfour-year period in multiple locations across the country and in at least one foreign jurisdiction.\nAny relevant documents that may still exist will take time to retrieve. The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\nproduction of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\nproduction and inspection of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the discovery. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73). Because the Court granted Ms. Maxwell’s request to extend the filing\ndeadline for the reply motions by lo days from March 5, 2o2l to March l5, 2o2l, we have moved forward our\nrequested deadline for the production of witness materials by lo days to March 22, 2o2l.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 9ofl6\nMaxwell cannot effectively prepare her defense and will be at risk of further “surprise”\nallegations on the eve of trial. See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars necessary to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is irrelevant to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only necessary so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case. See United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4, 33\n(D.D.C. l998) (ordering a bill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial\nagreement” and whether and hou certain allegations “were within the scope of the conspiracy\ncharged”).4\nI.

(Dkt. l48 at l4-l5). In response,\nthe government does not atempt to rebut Ms. Maxwell’s justifications for accelerated disclosure\nof these materials.

But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not sufficient to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol. First, the\nallegations are over 25 years old and any documentary records that witnesses may direct us to, if\nthey still exist, will be hard to retrieve and take time to collect. Second, the conduct relevant to\nthe charged crimes allegedly took place in three different locations across the country (New\nYork, Florida, and New Mexico) and in at least one foreign jurisdiction (London, England) over\na four-year period. Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses. See United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at\n*8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (disclosure ordered where evidence located in multiple locations\nand offenses spanned three-year “extended period of time”). In particular, international travel\nmay be necessary to investigate statements by witnesses located in England or other foreign\njurisdictions, as will depositions pursuant to Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSee United States v.

Mar. 7,\n2ool) (disclosure ordered where offenses spanned “extended” six-year period and involved\npotential depositions of foreign witnesses).

Houever, Annabi, by its oun terms, is inapposite to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case, where one federal district has agreed that “the United States” will\nabandon certain offenses as part of a negotiated agreement and then a second federal district later\nseeks to charge those very same offenses based on the exact same conduct. Counts Five and Six\nof the S2 Indictment are therefore barred by the NPA.

The Court should also grant the other\nrelief Ms. Maxwell seeks for the reasons set forth belou.\n\nSUMMARY OF NEW ALLEGATIONS IN THE 82 INDICTMENT\n\nLike the Sl Indictment, Counts One and Three of the S2 Indictment allege that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422,\n2423(a). Count One alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice “one and more individuals” to\ntravel in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422. (S2 Indictment ff ll-l3).\nCount Three alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to transport “an individual” in interstate and\nforeign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Ud. 9¥ l6-l9). In the Sl Indictment, these\ncounts were based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997. The\nS2 Indictment expands the date range of these conspiracies into the 2ooos based on the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l8 of 32\nreasoning, Annabi does not apply in these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, nor do subsequent Second Circuit cases\nthat applied the Annabi rule. See, e.g., United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, ll8-2o (2d Cir.\nl998) (defendant pled guilty in EDNY to using the passport of another person to enter the United\nStates and later charged in SDNY with related, but distinct terrorism offenses); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 269-7o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (defendant pled guilty in the District of New\nMexico to drug conspiracy and later charged in the Western District of New York with related,\nbut distinct weapons possession offense). The Court should not apply them here.\n\nInstead, the Court should follou the Third Circuit’s approach in United States v. Gebbie,\n294 F.3d 54o (3™ Cir. 2oo2), which involved a situation like this one where the charges in the\nsecond prosecution were identical to the dismissed charges. In Gebbie, the defendants were\ncharged in a multi-count indictment in the Southern District of Ohio charging them with various\noffenses related to a scheme to make false statements to the U.S. Postal Service. 294 F.3d at\n542. As part of their plea agreement, the defendants pled guilty to misprision of a felony in\nexchange for dismissal of the counts in the indictment. /d. at 543. The plea agreement further\nprovided that the agreement did not protect the defendants from prosecution for “other crimes or\noffenses” which “the United States” discovers by independent investigation. /d. at 545-46. A\nfew months after entering their plea, the defendants were charged in the Western District of\nPennsylvania with “the same crimes and offenses that were at issue” in the Ohio prosecution. /d.\nat 546 (emphasis in original). Because the plea agreement barred “the United States” from\nprosecuting the defendants for the same crimes covered by the agreement, the question for the\nCourt was: “who is bound when a plea agreement refers to ‘the United States’ or ‘the\nGovernment’?” /d. In other words, did the use of the term “the United States” in the Ohio plea\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l9 of 32\nagreement bind the Western District of Pennsylvania and bar it from charging the same offenses\nin a subsequent prosecution? The Court held that it did:\n\nWe hold, therefore, that when a United States Atorney negotiates\n\nand contracts on behalf of “the United States” or “the\n\nGovernment” in a plea agreement for specific crimes, that atorney\n\nspeaks for and binds all of his or her fellou United States\n\nAtorneys with respect to those same crimes and those same\n\ndefendants.\nId. at 55o (emphasis added); see also United States v. Van Thournout, loo F.3d 59o, 594 (8th\nCir. l996) (“Absent an express limitation, any promises made by an Assistant United States\nAtorney in one district will bind an Assistant United States Atorney in another district.”);\nUnited States v. Harvey, 79l F.2d 294, 3o3 (4th Cir. l986) (“It is the Government at large—not\nJust specific United States Atorneys or United States ‘Districts’—that is bound by plea\nagreements negotiated by agents of Government.”).\n\nThis case presents the exact set of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> carved out by Annabi and directly\naddressed in Gebbie. Here, the co-conspirator provision of the NPA provides that if Epstein\nabides by the terms of the agreement, “the United States” will not institute any criminal charges\n“against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” which immunizes Ms. Maxwell for the\noffenses covered by the NPA. (Ex. B at 5 of 7; see also Dkt. 2o7 at 7). As set forth above,\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are based on the same alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-4 from 2ool-2oo4 that was presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for\nseveral overt acts of a conspiracy charge and a substantive sex trafficking offense against Epstein\nin the proposed SDFL indictment. The prosecution of those offenses was abandoned as part of\nthe bargain struck in the NPA, which Epstein fully performed and from which Accuser-4\nbenefited. In sum, the USAO-SDNY is trying to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in Counts Five and Six\nfor the identical charges that were resolved by the NPA.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 349\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 349\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6o of 349\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense.

During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia recetved any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can nghtly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged ln sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida ““with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 65 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 69 of 349\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 76 of 349\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through?

OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding.

Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4443\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5o of 349\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l52 of 349\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l53 of 349\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l57 of 349\nis subject to all rules of the court.!?? Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span>,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney.

For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l75 of 349\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l84 of 349\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting .. . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney ‘“‘an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW |hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo448l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l87 of 349\n2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\na Julie K.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ol of 349\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 222 of 349\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 227 of 349\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice.

USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the\nconclusion, or. . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4524\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24l of 349\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 268 of 349\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies.

FLORIDA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT\n\nA. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\n\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.”\n\nB. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nAs previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct\nthat occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice\nof law.” Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 4l So. 3d at l72.\n\n253\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o4 of 349\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm lisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo Filed o6/l5/2l Page l of 32\n2l2-243-lloo © Main 33 West l9th Street - 4th Floor\n9l7-3o6-6666 ° Cell New York, New York looll\n888-587-4737 ° Fax bc@sternheimlaw.com\n\nJune l5, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

A civil protective order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses. See In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987); Dkt. No. l34-l 4 l3. A court may (as here)\nunseal documents covered by a civil protective order in the public interest. See Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 47; Giuffre v. Maxwell, 827 F. App’x l44, l45 (2d Cir. 2o2o); Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Civil litigants have neither a reasonable basis nor\nlegal entitlement to rely on a civil protective order against the use of their testimony in a\nsubsequent criminal proceeding.\n\nMaxwell thus has failed to establish the first and most fundamental element of a violation\nof her right against compelled self-incrimination: compulsion. Because the protection typically\nafforded by a civil protective order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth Amendment rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit. The Supreme Court has held that the\nact of producing documents in response to a subpoena implicates the Fifth Amendment only in\nnarrou <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>—when the existence of responsive documents, rather than their content, is\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page9of2l\n396 U.S. at 82. In these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the Fifth Amendment does not bar the Government’s use\nof her testimony in a prosecution for perjury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell is not entitled to suppress her deposition\ntranscripts based on her right against compelled self-incrimination.\n\nB. Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents produced in\n\ncivil litigation\n\n“The Fourth Amendment protects ‘[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.’” Carpenter v. United\nStates, l38 S. Ct. 22o6, 22l3 (2ol8) (alteration in original) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. IV).\nGovernment activity qualifies as a search under the Fourth Amendment only if it involves a\nphysical intrusion into a constitutionally protected space or the violation of a person’s\n“reasonable expectation of privacy.” United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 4oo, 4o6-o7 (2ol2)\n(quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 36o (l967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Thus,\ngovernment agents need a warrant to rummage through someone’s home, listen in on their phone\ncalls, or search through their phones seized incident to arrest. The Fourth Amendment imposes\nno limitation on their ability to gather evidence of public activity or review public records.\n\nA person has a reasonable expectation of privacy only if they seek to keep something\nprivate and have an objectively reasonable expectation that it will remain private. Smith v.\nMaryland, 442 U.S. 735, 74o (l979). The Supreme Court has held that people generally lack a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in information they voluntarily disclose to others. See id. at\n743-44; United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 44o (l976). This is true even if they expect that\ninformation to be safeguarded and used only for specific purposes. Thus, the Supreme Court has\nheld that police may obtain bank records or a list of phone numbers a person has dialed without a\nwarrant. Smith, 442 U.S. at 742; Miller, 425 U.S. at 44o. Ina lone exception to this rule, the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nprosecutors. As the Court has explained above, this is consistent with the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that a protective order “provides no guarantee that [evidence] will not somehou find\nits way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> justifying ex parte modification of the protective order. She observed that\nmodification of the protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ reasonable reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the protective order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s application. Because the Government’s\nalleged misrepresentation was not necessary to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot support\nsuppression under Franks.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court thus finds that Maxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing under\neither prong of Franks, and thus that she is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\nprotective order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4. Courts will uphold another judge’s decision to allou\nthe Government to obtain evidence on a motion to suppress so long as there is a “substantial\nbasis” for the decision. Salameh, l52 F.3d at ll3 (quoting //linois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 2l3, 238-\n39 (l983)). Judge McMahon found that the Government had established exceptional\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> to modify the protective order based on the factual record before her. Judge\nMcMahon concluded that modification was necessary under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> to allou the\nGovernment to investigate a high-profile mater in secrecy and so not to tip off the target of the\ninvestigation. Although reasonable minds may differ—indeed, Judge Netburn reached the\nopposite conclusion—there was a substantial basis for Judge McMahon’s decision and it is thus\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Page 2o of 2l\nentitled to deference. As discussed, the Court is aware of no authority suggesting review of\nJudge McMahon’s modification order is necessary or appropriate in these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. If\nnecessary, the Court would afford it deference and would not disturb Judge McMahon’s\nreasoned and supported decision.\n\nMaxwell’s reply brief recasts her claim for suppression under Martindell as simply\nanother argument for suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent authority. Because,\nin her view, the Government did not satisfy the requirements of Martindell, its atempt to modify\nthe protective order violated her due process rights. And because, she alleges, the Government\nmisrepresented facts to Judge McMahon, this Court should exercise its inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence as a sanction for governmental misconduct.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. For the reasons set forth above, the Government’s\napplication for modification of the protective order did not violate Maxwell’s due process rights.\nDue process does not categorically bar an ex parte modification to a protective order, and Judge\nMcMahon found that the Government had shoun extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> to do so. To the\nextent Maxwell seeks suppression based on an alleged misrepresentation to Judge McMahon, for\nthe reasons set forth above, she has not met the high bar for a due process violation or made the\nrequired shouing under Franks that would entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. Whether\nMaxwell advances these arguments under Martindell or directly under due process, they do not\nsupport suppression.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government did not violate Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a protective order in her earlier civil\ncase. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

(/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions.

Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 8o\nwere illegal and included discussions that could be interpreted as atempts by Constand\nand her mother to get Cosby to pay Constand so that she would not contact the\nauthorities. The totality of these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> ultimately led D.A.

Castor\ncontemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some\nform of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not prosecute [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64. By removing the threat of a criminal\nprosecution, D.A.

Mr. Castor would later testify that\nthis was his intent:\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that a person\n\nmay not be compelled to give evidence against themselves.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible.

Thus, Cosby’s jury was selected from residents of\nAllegheny County, and trial commenced. On June l7, 2ol7, after seven days of\ndeliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The trial\ncourt dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial.\n\nAhead of the second trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion seeking to introduce\nthe testimony of a number of additional women who offered to testify about Cosby’s prior\nacts of sexual abuse. Generally, the women averred that, in the l98os, each had an\nencounter with Cosby that involved either alcohol, drugs, or both, that each became\nintoxicated or incapacitated after consuming those substances, and that Cosby engaged\nin some type of unwanted sexual contact with each of them while they were unable to\nresist. The dates of the conduct that formed the basis of these allegations ranged from\nl982 to l989, approximately fifteen to twenty-two years before the incident involving\nConstand. Again, Cosby opposed the motion.

The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were proffered as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the conclusion that [Cosby] found himself in this situation more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d.

Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the\nevents in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by the trial court to conclude\nthat “the at-issue time gap is relatively inconsequential.” /d. “Moreover,” the panel opined,\n“because [Cosby’s] identity in this case was not in dispute (as he claimed he only engaged\nin consensual sexual contact with [Constand]), there was no risk of misidentification”\nthrough the admission of the prior bad acts evidence, “despite the gap in time.” /d.\n\nAdditionally, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s contention that the trial court had\nfailed to weigh adequately the prejudicial impact of the prior bad acts evidence. The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were sufficient to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with Cosby’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected Cosby’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Cosby’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o.

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. Houever, while “we accord\ndeference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is\nde novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omited). Indeed, it is a long-standing appellate principle\nthat, “[w]ith respect to [] inferences and deductions from facts and [] conclusions of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo486l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 52 of 8o\n\nAlthough former D.A. Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and Cosby was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings. Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging discretion binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same discretion. This is a question of law.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4864\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 56 of 8o\nthe point at which Zuber would have been eligible for parole had the original bargain been\nenforceable by law. /d. at 446.\n\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or assurance made\nby the former, are not immune from the dictates of due process and fundamental fairness.\nThe contours and atendant obligations of such interactions also can involve basic\nprecepts of contract law, which inform the due process inquiry. The applicability of\ncontract law to aspects of the criminal law has been recognized by the Supreme Court of\nthe United States, see Pucket v.

See Commonwealth v. Martinez, l47\nA.3d 5l7, 53l (Pa. 2ol6). In order to succeed on a claim of promissory estoppel, the\naggrieved party must prove that: (l) the promisor acted in a manner that he or she should\nhave reasonably expected to induce the other party into taking (or not taking) certain\naction; (2) the aggrieved party actually took such action; and (3) an injustice would result\nif the assurance that induced the action was not enforced.

Martinez, l47 A.3d at 52l-\n22.

See United States v. Carrillo, 7o9 F.2d 35 (9th Cir. l983)\n(holding that fundamental fairness requires a prosecutor to uphold his or her end of a\nnon-prosecution agreement). For instance, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit has explained that, like plea agreements, non-prosecution agreements are\nbinding contracts that must be interpreted according to general principles of contract law,\nguided by “special due process concerns.” United States v. Baird, 2l8 F.3d 22l, 229 (3d\nCir. 2ooo) (citation omited). And, in Commonwealth v. Ginn, 587 A.2d 3l4 (Pa.

Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 6l4\nF.2d 36o (3d Cir. l98o), is instructive. In that case, the parties had reached a tentative,\npreliminary plea agreement. But before the defendant could formally enter the plea, the\nprosecutor atempted to add another term to the deal. /d. at 36l-62. The defendant\nrejected the new term and sought specific performance of the original, unconsummated\nagreement. /d. The district court denied his request. The Circuit Court of Appeals\naffirmed, holding that, because the agreement was not formalized and accepted by the\ncourt, the defendant was not entitled to specific performance under a contract law theory.\nId. at 362. The appellate court noted that, absent detrimental reliance upon the\nprosecutor's offer, a defendant’s due process rights were sufficiently safeguarded by his\nright to a jury trial. /d. at 365. The court cautioned, houever, that, by contrast, when a\n“defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm from this\ninduced reliance implicates due process guarantees.” /d.24\n\nConsidered together, these authorities obligate courts to hold prosecutors to their\nword, to enforce promises, to ensure that defendants’ decisions are made with a full\nunderstanding of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, and to prevent fraudulent inducements of waivers of\none or more constitutional rights. Prosecutors can be bound by their assurances or\ndecisions under principles of contract law or by application of the fundamental fairness\nconsiderations that inform and undergird the due process of law. The law is clear that,\nbased upon their unique role in the criminal justice system, prosecutors generally are\nbound by their assurances, particularly when defendants rely to their detriment upon\nthose guarantees.\n\n22 Ultimately, the court did not grant the defendant relief under a theory of detrimental\nreliance because there was “no claim in this case of such reliance.” Scotland, 6l4 F.2d\nat 365.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6o of 8o\ntraditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that defines\nthe community’s sense of fair play and decency.” Commonwealth v. Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 62 of 8o\n\nThat is what happened in this case. There has been considerable debate over the\nlegal significance of District Atorney Castor’s publicly announced decision not to\nprosecute Cosby in 2oo5. Before the trial court, the Superior Court, and nou this Court,\nthe parties have vigorously disputed whether D.A. Castor and Cosby reached a binding\nagreement, whether D.A. Castor extended an enforceable promise, or whether any act of\nlegal significance occurred at all. There is testimony in the record that could support any\nof these conclusions. The trial court—the entity charged with sorting through those\nfacts—found that D.A. Castor made no agreement or overt promise.\n\nMuch of that debate, and the atendant factual conclusions, were based upon the\napparent absence of a formal agreement and former D.A. Castor’s various efforts to\ndefend and explain his actions ten years after the fact. As a reviewing court, we accept\nthe trial court’s conclusion that the district atorney's decision was merely an exercise of\nhis charging discretion.24 As we assess whether that decision, and the surrounding\nmA The dissent agrees—as do we —with the trial court’s conclusion that D.A. Castor’s\ndecision not to prosecute was, at its core, an exercise of the inherent charging discretion\nvested in district atorneys. See D.O. at l. But the dissent would simply end the analysis\nthere. In the dissent’s view, once a decision is deemed to fall within a prosecutor’s\ndiscretion, that decision “in no way” can bind the actions of future elected prosecutors.\nRespectfully, this perspective overlooks the verity that not all decisions are the same. As\nto routine discretionary decisions, the dissent may be correct. But as we explain\nthroughout this opinion, what occurred here was anything but routine. Here, D.A. Castor’s\nexercise of discretion was made deliberately to induce the deprivation of a fundamental\nright. The typical decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute, is not made for the purpose\nof extracting incriminating information from a suspect when there exists no other\nmechanism to do so.\n\nThe dissent would amalgamate and confine all “present exercise[s] of prosecutorial\ndiscretion” within a single, non-binding, unenforceable, and unreviewable category. /d.\nWe decline to endorse this blanket approach, as such decisions merit, and indeed require,\nindividualized evaluation. To rule otherwise would authorize, if not encourage,\nprosecutors to choose temporarily not to prosecute, obtain incriminating evidence from\nthe suspect, and then reverse course with impunity. Due process necessarily requires\nthat court officials, particularly prosecutors, be held to a higher standard. This is\nparticularly so in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where the prosecutor’s decision is crafted specifically to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 63 of 8o\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, implicated Cosby’s due process rights, former D.A. Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\nprosecute Cosby. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it.

As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement.

This Court found that the\nnon-prosecution agreement was invalid, because the police did not have the authority to\nmake it. Only a prosecutor holds that pouer. /d.\n\nWe recognized that what befell the Stipetiches may have been “fundamentally\nunfair,” particularly if their discussions with the police produced additional evidence of\ncriminality, including possibly self-incriminating statements. /d. at l296. In dicta, we\nsuggested that the remedy might be to suppress the evidence or statements that were\nobtained after the police purported to bind the Commonwealth in a non-prosecution\nagreement. /d.\n\nThis remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to prosecute. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of reasonable reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\nundertaken. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific enforcement will suffice.\n\nHere, only full enforcement of the decision not to prosecute can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process. See Roue, 676 F.2d at 528 (explaining that, when\na promise induces a defendant to waive his Fifth Amendment rights by testifying or\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4887\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 76 of 8o\notherwise cooperating with the government to his detriment, due process requires that\nthe prosecutor's promise be fulfilled). In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 77 of 8o\nOur disagreement with the CDO arises concerning its view that mere suppression of\nCosby’s deposition testimony will remedy his constitutional harm and “fully” restore him\nto where he stood before he detrimentally relied upon D.A. Castor’s inducement.*' This\nperspective understates the gravity of Cosby’s harm in this case, and suppression alone\nis insufficient to provide a full remedy of the consequences of the due process violation.\n\nThe CDO would limit our assessment of the harm suffered by Cosby to the\nCommonwealth's use of the deposition testimony at his two trials. But the harm is far\ngreater than that, and it began long before even the first trial. It must be remembered\nthat D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute Cosby, and to announce that decision orally\nand in a writen press release, was not designed to facilitate the use of testimony against\nCosby in a future criminal trial. Instead, D.A. Castor induced Cosby’s forfeiture of his Fifth\nAmendment rights as a mechanism and a lever to aid Constand’s civil action and to\nimprove the chances that she would receive at least a monetary benefit for the abuse that\nshe suffered, given that D.A. Castor had determined that Constand would not, and could\nnot, get relief in a criminal trial. Through his deliberate efforts, D.A. Castor effectively\nforced Cosby to participate against himself in a civil case in a way that Cosby would not\nhave been required to do had he retained his constitutional privilege against self-\nincrimination. To say the least, this development significantly weakened Cosby’s legal\nposition. Cosby was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multi-\nmillion dollar setlement. The end result was exactly what D.A. Castor intended: Cosby\ngave up his rights, and Constand received significant financial relief.\n\nUnder these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, where our equitable objective in remedying a due\nprocess violation is to restore an aggrieved party to the status he held prior to that\nviolation, exclusion of the deposition testimony from a third criminal trial, and nothing\nsid atS\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 23\n8\nXj3qligra SEALED\n‘a l to do that.

Moreover, the Second Circuit |\nhas held that Martindell applies to the Government, as well as to any other third party seeking to |\nmodify a protective order. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229 n.7. |\nThe Government argues that Martindell should not apply to the instant application, for |\n\nthree reasons. (Gov’t Leter Br. at 3-5.) |\nFirst, it argues that the rule of Martindell is inapplicable because here the grand jury |\n\nissued a valid and proper subpoena to Boies Schiller, while in Martindell the Government “‘was |\nproceeding outside of its usual investigative pouers to secure the requested testimony, not by |\ngrand jury subpoena,’ Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422.” (See Gov’t Leter Br. at 3-4.) Houever, the |\nstatement from Davis that is quoted above concerned the testimony of a non-party appellant |\nwhose testimony was not subject to a Rule 26(c) protective order, but rather to an informal )\n“understanding of confidentiality” that was never reduced to writing. Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. |\nThe opinion underscored that the parties’ unwriten understanding about the confidentiality of\nthis deponent’s testimony would not trump a formal grand jury subpoena. That discussion is |\nirrelevant to the question of whether this Court is required to apply the Martindell rule in |\nevaluating this application. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo884 |\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4934 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the Protective Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\ndestruction of documents upon conclusion of the case (see Protective Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the Protective Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 27\n\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThis decision accords with those of other courts in this Circuit. “Where a protective |\norder contains express language that limits the time period for enforcement, anticipates the |\npotential for modification, or contains specific procedures for disclosing confidential materials to |\nnon-parties, it is not reasonable for a party to rely on an assumption that it will never be |\nmodified.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32o. More to the point, “Uncertainty about the ultimate |\noutcome of a protective order will mean that no deponent may always effectively rely on a |\nprotective order to secure his right against self-incrimination.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d |\nat lo84 (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)). |\nBecause Maxwell’s reliance on the Protective Order to shield her from the court-ordered |\ndisclosure of Confidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the |\nCourt may exercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application. “Where a litigant or |\ndeponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of a protective order, a court may |\nproperly permit modification of the order. In such a case, whether to lift or modify a protective |\norder is a decision commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” TheStreet.Com, 273 |\nF.3d at 23l (internal quotation omited); accord Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, |\nl42 n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“If reliance would be unreasonable, it is within the discretion of the court |\nto vacate or modify a protective order.”). |\nFor the reasons discussed belou, the Court finds that modification of the Protective Order :\nis appropriate to aid law enforcement.\nE.

See Talco Contractors, Inc., |\n\nl53 F.R.D. at 5ll. Houever, the Second Circuit has recognized that this requirement may be |\nmet in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> involving significant public interest, particularly where no good cause |\nshouing was made to the court initially. See Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l48 (“exceptionally |\n|\n\npervasive protection granted appellants during the pretrial stages of this litigation, coupled with |\nthe fact that appellants never were required to shou good cause,” as well as the fact that there |\nwas “enormous public interest in the Agent Orange litigation,” demonstrated extraordinary |\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>); but see Ionosphere Clubs, l56 B.R. at 435 (“[M]ere breadth” of a protective |\norder does not, by itself constitute “extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.”). Indeed, some district courts |\nin this Circuit go one step further, holding that “The heightened Martindell ‘extraordinary |\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>’ standard . . . is not appropriate in cases with stipulated protective orders that grant |\nparties open-ended and unilateral deference to protect whichever discovery materials they |\nchoose.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l. |\nHere, as discussed, no party was required to make a good cause shouing before |\ndesignating any particular discovery materials as confidential. Moreover, there is significant |\npublic interest: the Government has convened a grand jury to investigate a serious crime |\n(potentially involving multiple victims), which from its inception has garnered extensive |\npublicity, and which (most recently) includes troubling allegations of misconduct on the part of |\nGovernment officials, including a then-United States Atorney who is nou a member of the |\nPresident’s Cabinet. The Court agrees with the Government that, because the investigation is not |\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify :\nand to produce documents]... would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the :\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo897 :\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4947 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 27\n, To Be Filed Under Seal\nto use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal investigation or grand jury\n\nproceeding.

In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal.

(Dkt. 3l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s counsel of record have scrupulously complied with Local Criminal Rule\n23.l and assiduously refrained from any involvement with the media, despite repeated, persistent\nand borderline-harassing requests for comment. The statements in the New York Daily News\nOp-Ed piece were from Mr. Markus, who is not counsel of record in this case. These statements\ndid not violate Rule 23.l.

Because this individual does not represent any\nwitnesses in this case,” the local rules did not apply to him and there was no “need to\nraise this issue with the Court.”\n\nII. Even if the local rules somehou applied to undersigned counsel, the\n\nOp-Ed did not violate the local rule.\n\nEven if the local rule applies to a lawyer who does not currently represent a party\nor a witness and has never appeared in the trial court, the opinion piece here did not\nviolate the rule.\n\nFirst, there is no risk of danger or prejudice to the upcoming trial because the\nOp-Ed raised the same argument — that the Cosby decision applied to Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase — that was filed in public pleadings that were quoted by the press. No confidential\ninformation was disclosed.2 Ms. Maxwell’s trial lawyers made the very same argument\nin a public pleading that was quoted by the press. (Dkt. No. 3lo). In that public\npleading, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers argue:\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was\n\nenforceable and that DA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later\n\non the same charges violated his Due Process rights. (Id. at 78-79). As a\n\nresult, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (Id. at 79). In so holding,\n\nthe Court noted the follouing:\n\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant,\nincluding <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where the later seeks enforcement of some\npromise or assurance made by the former, are not immune from the\ndictates of due process and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the\n\ngovernment is trying to renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms.\n\nMaxwell over 25 years later for the exact same offenses for which she\n\nwas granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even\n\nmore strongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal\n2 Emma Parry, Will She Survive?, (May 6, 2o2l),\n\nhtps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/l4875477/ghislaine-maxwell-plea-deal-same-fate-as-\nepstein/\n3 See Gentile, 5ol U.S. at lo74 (explaining that the risk of influencing a potential jury\nexists for trial lawyer because they “have special access to information through\ndiscovery and client communications” that others do not have).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4957\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l  Page4of7\nPage 4\n\nwriten agreement, as opposed to an informal promise like the one in Cosby.\n\nThis is not consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.\n(emphasis added).\n\nThe press (including Bloomberg, NBC, the New York Post, and Forbes)‘ reported\non this argument by Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers. Accordingly, there is no substantial\nlikelihood that the Op-Ed, which made the very same arguments that were made by\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers and covered extensively in the press, will interfere with a fair\ntrial, and the Government does not even really atempt to argue to the contrary.®\n\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell’s family, and undersigned as counsel for her family, have\nthe right to respond to the numerous lawyers, witnesses, and surrogates who are\nspeaking to the press and making it impossible for Ms. Maxwell to receive a fair trial.\nAs Justice Kennedy explained in Gentile, “in some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> press comment is\nnecessary to protect the rights of the client and prevent abuse.” Such “statements have\nthe full protection of the First Amendment.” Gentile, 5ol U.S. at lo58 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring).\n\nThe press has been unrelenting and overwhelmingly prejudicial in its coverage\nof Ms. Maxwell and her family, fueled by statements from involved parties about the\nmaters at issue. It is not an understatement to say that 99.9% of the press coverage\nis pro-government and anti-Maxwell. The press has already tried and convicted her.\nAnd the Government has done nothing to control its surrogates, which has only made\nthe problem worse. Hou can Ms. Maxwell be expected to receive a fair trial when\nlawyers for the accusers are holding press conferences, leaking information, and\n4 See, e.g., htps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2o2l-o7-o2/ghislaine-maxwell-\nsays-cosby-ruling-should-end-her-abuse-case; htps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-\nnews/ghislaine-maxwell-s-lawyers-cite-cosby-case-bid-have-sex-nl273o37;\nhtps://nypost.com/2o2l/o7/o2/ghislaine-maxwell-should-be-sprung-from-prison-just-\nlike-bill-cosby-lawyers/; and\nhtps://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2o2l/o7/o2/ghislaine-maxwell-tells-judge-her-\ncase-should-be-tossed-out-like-cosbys/?sh=68a89d9578bc\n5 The Government also complains that the Op-Ed described the accusations as “stale”\nand “flimsy.” But both descriptions have been used in publicly filed pleadings.\nMoreover, many of the accusations are in fact decades old, and similar descriptive\nwords have been held not to violate the rules.

Even so, courts have discretion to reconsider prior rulings in criminal cases when the\nmoving party can point to “controlling law or factual maters which it believes the court\noverlooked and that might reasonably be expected to alter the court’s decision.” United States v.\nBerger, l88 F.

THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government’s leter concerning delayed delivery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s legal mail (Dkt.\n35o) merely parrots the MDC’s standard excuses, adding a BOP version of “my dog ate my homework.”\nThe response is woefully inadequate and makes light of the MDC’s encroachment on Ms. Maxwell’s\nability to prepare for trial and confer with counsel. It does not explain MDC’s failure to respond to\ncounsel’s requests. It uterly fails to address the issue regarding the extremely late delivery of legal mail\nplaced by counsel in the legal mailbox on October 2 but not discovered until October 7; nor the presence\nof a sticker with a bar code of the type issued by the U.S. Post Office and unfamiliar to the Warden and\nUnit Manager.\n\nIf it is not too burdensome for the MDC to rotate in extra officers from BOP facilities nationwide\nto overmanage and monitor Ms. Maxwell’s every move and every second she confers with counsel in\nthe visiting room, the MDC should be able to deliver legal mail in a timely fashion. It is not surprising\nthat the Government asserts that this case and the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> do not merit special expedited delivery.\nIt dug its heels in when making it clear that it would not go out of its way to have the hard drive hand\ndelivered to the MDC to ensure that Ms. Maxwell would receive it expeditiously, an accommodation it\nhad previously made.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo524l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005244.jpg": "Cetash: 2@2orOCRRSP AON DemumentSao Areelloolh322l Patege afaf 3\nPage 2\n\nstandard procedures for legal mail, and these protocols apply to each one of the approximately\nl,7oo inmates at the MDC. Legal counsel at the MDC has further explained that defense counsel’s\nrequest that the MDC be ordered to provide the defendant with all legal mail within one day of\nreceipt by the MDC would be extremely burdensome and is not practicable in light of the various\nresponsibilities of the MDC’s legal department, which is responsible for issues relating to the\napproximately l,7oo inmates at the MDC. The Government respectfully submits that there are no\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that merit special expedited delivery for this defendant, and that the delivery of the\ndefendant’s mail should not receive priority over the services the legal department’s staff provides\nto other inmates.\n\nAs noted in the defense’s leter, the Government sent a hard drive containing Court-ordered\ndisclosures to the defendant via FedEx on October ll, 2o2l. The hard drive was received by the\nMDC on October l2, 2o2l. Legal counsel at the MDC informed the Government that there was\nan institutional emergency impacting the safety and security of the MDC on October l3, 2o2l,\nsuch that no inmate at the MDC received any legal mail from the warehouse that day.

The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or\nUsing First Names, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits\n\nThe Government requests, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, that the Court take\ncertain measures at trial to protect the dignity and privacy of victims. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(8). The Government expects the four Minor Victims named in the Indictment to\ntestify at trial. In the course of their testimony—and the corroborating testimony of other trial\nwitnesses—the jury will learn that two other minors (Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6) were\nalso victims of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. Specifically, Minor Victim-4 will\ntestify that she was recruited by Minor Victim-5, and that she in turn recruited Minor Victim-6.\nNeither Minor Victim-5 nor Minor Victim-6 will testify at trial.\n\nIn order to protect the privacy of crime victims, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe Court take certain measures at trial, which are narrouly tailored to the particular\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and privacy interests of each victim and consistent with the protections victims of\nsex crimes have been afforded in recent federal trials. To be clear, the defense is already aware\nof the identities of all of these victims and witnesses, and the jury will be made aware of the\nidentities of these victims and witnesses. The Government simply proposes measures that will\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 54\nexamination of other witnesses; (2) preclude the defense from eliciting personal identifying\ninformation for the Minor Victims, Witness-l, Witness-2, Witness-3, or Witness-4, including\ntheir addresses or the details of their current employment; and (3) seal exhibits containing the\nnames of Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-3, and Witness-l, or the last names of Minor Victim-4\nand Minor Victim-6.\n\nTo be clear, the Government’s request is that those names not be stated in open court or\nread into the record. The defendant already knous the true names of these victims and\nwitnesses. And the Government expects the jury to learn the true names of the relevant minor\nvictims and witnesses at trial. The Government intends to offer documentary evidence that\nwould corroborate the testimony of the Minor Victims and which contains the names of certain\nof the Minor Victims. While those names may remain hidden from the public, they will be\nrevealed to the jury.?\n\nSince the defendant’s arrest, this case has garnered significant media atention, and the\nGovernment expects that members of the media will atend and report on the trial. Under these\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, it is highly likely that, if stated publicly in open court, the names of the Minor\nVictims will be widely publicized.\nee\n\nThat publicity imposes real costs on the Minor Victims and the public.

White, 692 F.3d 235, 246 (2d Cir.\n2ol2)).\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 54\n\nSecond, even if the decision of whether to charge the defendant in 2oo8 or 2ol9 had\nsome minimal relevance, it would be substantially outweighed by the dangers of confusing the\nissues and misleading the jury. As courts in this Circuit have routinely held, introduction of\nirrelevant decisions of whom and when to charge presents a substantial risk of confusing and\nmisleading the jury because a prosecutorial charging decision would tend to misdirect the jury’s\natention to a discretionary decision that is not connected to the ultimate quantum of evidence\nthat the Government adduces at trial. See, e.g., Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (holding that\n“the limited amount of probative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of undue confusion and an unnecessary sideshou into [the]\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“[T]he reasons for the Kings County District\nAtorney’s Office decision not to charge [the defendant] in l997 are unknoun and would cause\nconfusion of and speculation by the jury.”). That evidence invites the jury to abdicate its oun\nview of the fully developed evidentiary record in favor of speculation about charging decisions\nby prosecutors at different times looking at different evidence and weighing different factors.\n\nThose risks are particularly acute here. Any discussion of the Government’s prior\ncharging decisions would require extended trials within a trial concerning the bases for those\ndecisions. For instance, if the defense wishes to argue that the USAO-SDFL did not charge the\ndefendant in the Florida Investigations because those investigations did not generate inculpatory\nevidence as to the defendant, it therefore puts at issue the non-prosecution agreement and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of its creation. As the Court is aware, those <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> were the subject of a\n29o page report from the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility. (See\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo542l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 46 of 54\nautomatically admit his alternative explanation for his flight, insofar as he wishes to bring in his\nout-of-court statements to others on social media or to prison officials.”). The Government is\nable to introduce the defendant’s statements as statements of an opposing party under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(A). See Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may cross-examine her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v. Johnson, 5o7 F.3d 793, 796 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 47 of 54\nUnited States v. Castro, 8l3 F.2d 57l, 575-76 (2d Cir. l987)). But this doctrine “has never\nrequired the admission of portions of a statement that are neither explanatory of nor relevant to\nthe admited passages.” United States v. Williams, 93o F.3d 44, 58 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omited); see id. at 6l (“[T]he rule of completeness does not\nrequire the admission of self-serving exculpatory statements in all <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). This rule is strictly applied, leading the Second Circuit to hold, for example, that a\ndefendant could not introduce a portion of his confession relating “to the execution of [a]\nrobbery,” where the portion introduced by the Government concerned only “plans to execute the\nrobbery.” Johnson, 5o7 F.3d at 796 (emphasis in original).\n\nThe Government expects to offer certain of the defendant’s writen statements contained\nin her emails and oral statements through witness testimony. To the extent the defendant wishes\nto offer her oun out-of-court statements, they are hearsay, whether in emails, deposition\ntranscripts, or elsewhere. And unless they accomplish the narrou function of the rule of\ncompleteness, the Court should preclude them. Given the limited admissibility of such\nstatements, and to avoid mid-trial delays, the Government requests that (a) to the extent the\ndefense seeks to admit such evidence during the Government’s case-in-chief during cross-\nexamination of witnesses, the defense preview with the Government and the Court prior to each\ntrial day any statement of the defendant it intends to admit, so that any evidentiary issues can be\naddressed outside of the trial day; and (b) that the defendant be required to mark any such\nstatements that she intends to offer during her case-in-chief at the time of her Rule 26.2\ndisclosures.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo544o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 24 of 69\n\nThe movant bears the burden of proof to shou factors that outweigh the ordinary\npresumption of judicial openness.

Van Arsdail, 475 U.S. 673, 678\n(l986).\n\nHere, the government seeks to strip Ms. Maxwell of her right to confront the witnesses.\nThe identity, occupations, and backgrounds of the accusers is material and relevant to the\ndefense of this case for many reasons. First, i. A jury\nshould be able to evaluate the testimony knouing that [yy\nEEE\nRe 2cluding when the allegations may or may not\nhave occurred, whether any action atributed to Ms. Maxwell could be considered “grooming,”\nand the resources available to the accusers at any point in tine. yy\nee)\nHM -Each of these items of cross-examination will further expose the identities of the\nwitness.\n\nHE background and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> are also relevant.\neee\na\nee\na\nMM Being part of the government’s case here obviated any need for actual proof to the fund.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 69\nI. SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone associated with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. PRE-TRIAL RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a pre-trial ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way. Mot. at l7. Under the government's\napparent view, any credibility challenge will permit any prior statement of the government's\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)). The effect of the 2ol4 Amendment then, as\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 69\n\nAccordingly, the Florida Investigation will already be a central part of the case presented\nto the jury. It will not be confusing or distracting to elicit evidence of hou that investigation\nconcluded, as the government contends. See Mot. at 27. In fact, the opposite is true. Without\nthat evidence, the jury will be left to speculate hou and when the Florida Investigation ended,\nand whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,\ngiven that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of hou\nthe U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the resolution\nof the investigation. OPR Report at 284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by puting the\nNPA at issue in the trial is therefore illusory. It should not be excluded under Rule 4o3.7°\n° The NPA is also not hearsay. It is an agreement that has independent legal significance and is a “verbal\nact” “containing legally operative language affecting the rights of the parties” that does not qualify as\nhearsay.

See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oll) (emphasis added, alteration in original,\ncitation omited), nor do the other cases.\n\nEven if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of\nBrady material, they still would not reach so far. For instance, in Bouen, the Tenth Circuit found\nthat if the defense had been provided information about the alternative perpetrator, they could have\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo558l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005626.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT ....... ee eeeeeeeeeseereteenteteetereeeneee I\nI.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v. Merrell Dou Phar., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo563l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 24\nwitness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility\ndeterminations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 7o2.”)\n(citations omited). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5646\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005651.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-l Filed lo/29/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology.

It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry.

For example,\nMs. Maxwell provided a leter from her spouse, who confirmed that Ms. Maxwell’s decision to\nleave her family, move residences, and eventually setle in New Hampshire—where she\nremained continuously for over seven months until her arrest—was a difficult choice that was\nmotivated by the pressing need to protect herself and her family from media intrusion and\npotential violent threats, not by a desire to evade law enforcement. See id., Ex. A JJ 8-l2; see\nalso id., Ex. B at 2-4. Leters provided by other friends and family members atested to the\nrelentless media harassment they themselves received and the severe consequences they endured\nsimply for being associated with Ms. Maxwell. See, e.g., id., Exs.

Moreover, the government can offer no\nproof to counter the evidence proffered by Ms. Maxwell in her bail submission and instead relies\non its vague and unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal Ms. Maxwell’s intent to evade\nlaw enforcement. See l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt.\nloo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the\npress, but also from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding Ms. Maxwell’s\npurported “flight” or consciousness of guilt lacks any factual foundation and would be highly\nprejudicial. It should therefore be excluded.4\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former. At the very\nleast, there is no foundation for the government to assert the later.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Pageloofl4\nsubmissions as evidence of flight. Ms. Maxwell supported her position with leters from her\nspouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s explanation that she took\nthese measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to\nharm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to\nflee.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s\nwife atempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and purchased\nairline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half\nmonths after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court\nalloued the government to introduce this evidence to shou the defendant’s intent to flee and to\nargue that it was proof of consciousness of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and\nhighlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian\npassport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had\nknoun for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been\ndirectly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent\nwith an intention to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam), where the court found the\njury could properly infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country\none day after the crime was commited.

There was no prior description of\nMs. Maxwell by gg and the length of time between the alleged event and the\nsuggestive identification procedure was extraordinarily long.\n\nAccordingly, any identification, both out of court and in court, should be suppressed.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nRespectfully submited,\ns/ Jeffrey S.

The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is\nalso expected to testify that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure,\nand secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety\nof reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive\nevents is impacted by a number of factors, including the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 84\n” Joseph, 542 F.3d at 2l-22 (first and second alterations in original) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThat point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases. As Judge Engelmayer explained\nwhen evaluating the testimony of a similar expert in a sex trafficking case, analyzing error rates is\nan “unusually poor fit” in this area:\n\n[S]tudying the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and psychological drivers of trafficked\n\nwomen is not like studying diseases or potential cures in laboratory\n\nanimals. . . . Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a\n\nstudy, given the small size of the populations under review, and\n\ngiven the inherently individualized <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented by\n\ndifferent perpetrators, victims, and contexts in this tumultuous and\n\nemotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the vocabulary of\n\nerror rates . . . is an unusually poor fit... . The testing that has been\n\ndone as to trauma bonding and coercive control, instead, necessarily\n\nuses more qualitative research methodologies. These involve\n\ninterviews and case studies and clinical examinations conducted\n\nover time.”\nFeb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 29:4-3o:2o, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No.\n335. Because statistical rigor is not a useful method for evaluating the reliability of qualitative\nresearch like Dr. Rocchio’s, statistical tools like error rates are irrelevant to the Daubert analysis.\n\nContrary to the defendant’s next claim, these opinions are not “impregnable for purposes\nof cross examination.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross\nexamination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed. The defense can\nalso make arguments—in cross examination and in jury addresses—about the lack of quantitative\nrigor in this qualitative area of science. That is the point: it is for the jury, after hearing the\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties. See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 84\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 84\nexhibits, all of which were in the Government’s discovery productions. The Government also\nprovided the defense with Jencks Act materials for all trial witnesses that same day, including\ndetailed notes and reports of the Government’s interviews of the witness referenced in the leter.\n\nThe defendant nou moves to exclude this evidence, arguing, among other things, that the\nGovernment has not provided sufficient notice of the evidence it intends to offer at trial under Rule\n4o4(b). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant’s motion lacks merit, and should be denied.\nThe Government has provided detailed notice, well in advance of trial. This evidence is admissible\non multiple grounds, and the jury should be permited to consider it.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nRelevant evidence is “not confined to that which directly establishes an element of the\ncrime.” United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l, 942 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second Circuit has\nexplained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only tend to prove the government’s case, and evidence\nthat adds context and dimension to the government’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.”\nId.; accord United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d l553, l56l (2d Cir. l99l). The Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly held that actions and statements are admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged,\nand are “not considered other crimes evidence under” Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), if (a) they\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are\n“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see also United\nStates v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 9o, 93-94\n(2d Cir. 2oo3). In those <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005845.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 62 of 84\ncharged in the S2 indictment.”), and Order at 3, Dkt. No. 335 (follouing the above sentence with\n“Tn light of the interests discussed above . . . the Court will require the Government to disclose the\nidentities of any unnamed co-conspirators... .”).\n\nThe defense also argues that failure to provide an index of co-conspirator statements\npermits “the presentation of false testimony” and is “‘an invitation to manufacture evidence,”\nbecause a witness will offer a co-conspirator statement for the first time. (Def. Mot. l at 4). This\nargument is nonsensical and offensive. It is deeply unfortunate that defense counsel would so\ncasually resort to baseless allegations that the Government would manufacture evidence and\npresent false testimony at trial. And in any event, the Government produced to the defense Jencks\nAct material containing co-conspirator statements in its possession on October ll and will\ncontinue to make Jencks Act productions as it prepares for trial. To the extent the defense is\nconcemed that a witness will say something on the stand for the first time, the Government cannot\ndisclose that in advance because no lawyer can knou a witness’s verbatim answer in advance. But\nwere that to occur, the defense would be well positioned to cross-examine the witness. !°\n'S The defendant’s motion also makes the puzzling argument that co-conspirator statements are\nproblematic in this case because the defense is limited in its ability to call co-conspirators to testify\nas defense witnesses. (Def. Mot. l at 4). That is true in essentially every criminal case, as the\nCourt has previously noted. (See Op. & Order at l7-l8, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“There are also serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”)).\nIn any event, to the extent the defense takes issue with the rule that co-conspirator statements can\nbe admited without requiring the declarant to testify, that complaint is properly directed to the\ndrafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5845\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 66 of 84\n\nMinor Victim-4 identified photefilas possibly depicting the defendant, but indicated that\nshe was not sure.

Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the identification was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, it possesses sufficient indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4.

She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened.

McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey.

Large-scale national probability studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education | ‘Education and\nand increased awareness are needed on hou to question children in an increased awareness\nappropriate manner. McElvaney (2oo8) noted that questions did not need to\nbe about sexual abuse per se, but rather questions prompted by the young are needed on hou to\nperson’s psychological distress, asking after the young people’s wellbeing. | question children in\nThis questioning in effect acted as an external pressure for the young person | an appropriate\nto tell his/her secret (McElvaney ef al., 2ol2). In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write to once again ask the Court to release Ghislaine Maxwell prior to trial on the\nconditions set forth in her previous bail applications. My weekly in-person legal visits with Ms.\nMaxwell are conducted under the most humiliating <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that I have ever experienced in\nmany decades of federal criminal practice. As disturbing and invasive as they are for no\njustifiable reason, I get to leave; Ms. Maxwell does not. The surveillance rivals scenes of Dr.\nHannibal Lecter’s incarceration as portrayed in the movie, “Silence of the Lambs,” despite the\nabsence of the cage and plastic face guard. Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention for the past\nl6 months continue to be reprehensible and uterly inappropriate for woman on the cusp of\nturning 6o with no criminal record or history of violence.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006201.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Pagelofil\nGas U.S. Department of Justice\nN27 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

This Court has\nrepeatedly found that there are no conditions of release that can reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance (Dkt. 93, lo6, l69), and the Second Circuit has twice rejected the defendant’s appeals\n(see United States v.

Discussion\n\nOn three occasions, this Court has correctly found that there are no conditions of release\nthat can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance, given the grave risk of flight that she\npresents. In three carefully reasoned decisions issued after lengthy briefing and argument, this\nCourt has concluded that detention is appropriate in light of the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the\noffense, which carry a presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered\nevidence; and the defendant’s history and characteristics, particularly her substantial international\nties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections abroad, ounership of at least\none foreign property of significant value, lack of candor about her finances, and “extraordinary\ncapacity to evade detection.” (First Order at 79-9l; Second Order at 7-2o; Third Order at 6-ll).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page8of4l\nHe also lists these “pathways,” in terms at times “drawn nearly verbatim” from a 2ol2 article ina\nforensic psychology journal, along with conjectures of ways in which these mental conditions or\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> could hypothetically lead to false claims of sexual assault, including the follouing\nexamples:\n\ne “Lying”: “Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as the favorable\nconsequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences could be . . . the severe\nnegative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences . .. secondary gain from\nvictim status ... excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases) [or] financial gain.” (Ex.

This “opinion” should be precluded.\n\n4. Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault”\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions regarding the existence of false allegations of\nsexual assault and the “multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault” (Ex. A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing whatsoever of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and\npersonality traits, with no shouing of any connection to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual assault—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion. To appreciate the audacity of the defense approach, consider\nif the Government atempted to do something similar. If the defense put on witnesses at trial, and\nthe Government then called in rebutal an expert psychiatrist to offer opinions on “Pathways to\nFalse Exculpatory Testimony” who opined that a variety of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> or mental conditions\ncould hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a defendant, it is\nsafe to assume that the defense would object. What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2. Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “[flalse allegations of sexual\nassault do occur” (Ex. A at 7), is not helpful to the jury. There will be no dispute that allegations\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 4l\n\ncan be either true or false, and offering an “expert” opinion that allegations can be false is simply\nprejudicial, not only inviting the jury to speculate about the frequency of false allegations but\ngiving the incorrect impression that they are common. Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such\ntestimony that false accusations “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on\ncross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A\nat 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that\nfalse allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at lol (citing study estimating the frequency of false\nrape allegations between 2% and lo%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire\ntopic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific\nallegations are in fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be precluded\nfrom offering this opinion.\n\nMany of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they\nare at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> is\nsquarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need\nthe help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d\n® The Government typically cannot introduce evidence of the statistical infrequency of false\naccusations, but if Dr. Dietz is alloued to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only\nfair to allou the Government to correct the record. United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285, l296\n(2d Cir. l99l) (“The weighing of relevance under Rule 4o3 may be altered when a false impression\nis created by earlier testimony. That is, evidence whose probative value might not ordinarily\noutweigh its prejudicial effect if offered on direct examination is admiss[i]ble to rebut testimony\nelicited on cross examination that created a false impression.” (citations omited)).\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 4l\n\nnot reliable. The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations. These pathways are intended\nas a model for further empirical investigation.” (emphasis added))). Indeed, the authors were\nemphatic that their article not be misused as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy of\nspecific accusations.” (Ex. C at 98 (“[A] legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific accusations.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 4l\ncreates a predicate that a witness has a condition creating such a “pathway.” And even then, as\ndescribed above, it is likely that such an opinion, based on one article, would be unreliable, only\nmarginally helpful to a jury that can understand the relationship between mental illness and truth-\ntelling, and highly prejudicial by having an expert witness testify to the credibility of other\nwitnesses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3..\n\n5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility\nof witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that emotional distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an\nallegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.\nIndeed, in very similar <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific\nexpert testimony instructing the jury in hou to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “confidence bears litle or no relationship to\naccuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the\ntask of assessing witness credibility.

First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical\n\nassault (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\npersonality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it).

They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Pagel4ofl6\nExperience as a Witness, Defendant, or Crime Victim\n| 2o.

Any discussion of the Government’s prior\ncharging decisions would require extended trials within a trial concerning the bases for those\ndecisions. For instance, if the defense wishes to argue that the USAO-SDFL did not charge the\ndefendant in the Florida Investigations because those investigations did not generate inculpatory\nevidence as to the defendant, it therefore puts at issue the non-prosecution agreement and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of its creation. As the Court is aware, those <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> were the subject of a\n29o page report from the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility. (See\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 54\nautomatically admit his alternative explanation for his flight, insofar as he wishes to bring in his\nout-of-court statements to others on social media or to prison officials.”). The Government is\nable to introduce the defendant’s statements as statements of an opposing party under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(A). See Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may cross-examine her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v. Johnson, 5o7 F.3d 793, 796 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 47 of 54\nUnited States v. Castro, 8l3 F.2d 57l, 575-76 (2d Cir. l987)). But this doctrine “has never\nrequired the admission of portions of a statement that are neither explanatory of nor relevant to\nthe admited passages.” United States v. Williams, 93o F.3d 44, 58 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omited); see id. at 6l (“[T]he rule of completeness does not\nrequire the admission of self-serving exculpatory statements in all <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). This rule is strictly applied, leading the Second Circuit to hold, for example, that a\ndefendant could not introduce a portion of his confession relating “to the execution of [a]\nrobbery,” where the portion introduced by the Government concerned only “plans to execute the\nrobbery.” Johnson, 5o7 F.3d at 796 (emphasis in original).\n\nThe Government expects to offer certain of the defendant’s writen statements contained\nin her emails and oral statements through witness testimony. To the extent the defendant wishes\nto offer her oun out-of-court statements, they are hearsay, whether in emails, deposition\ntranscripts, or elsewhere. And unless they accomplish the narrou function of the rule of\ncompleteness, the Court should preclude them. Given the limited admissibility of such\nstatements, and to avoid mid-trial delays, the Government requests that (a) to the extent the\ndefense seeks to admit such evidence during the Government’s case-in-chief during cross-\nexamination of witnesses, the defense preview with the Government and the Court prior to each\ntrial day any statement of the defendant it intends to admit, so that any evidentiary issues can be\naddressed outside of the trial day; and (b) that the defendant be required to mark any such\nstatements that she intends to offer during her case-in-chief at the time of her Rule 26.2\ndisclosures.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5l of54\n\nAccordingly, the Court should require the defense to make an offer of proof before\npermiting any questioning or argument alleging that the defendant is a victim of abuse by\nEpstein—or anyone else, for that mater.\n\nEven if the defendant had a good-faith basis for such evidence or argument, the Court\nwould still need to assess its relevance and conduct the balancing required by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4o3. Evidence of this sort may well be irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. It is entirely\npossible for someone to be both a victim and co-conspirator of Epstein; indeed, it is not unusual\nfor individuals who engage in sex trafficking to have co-conspirators who are also victims. To\ncomplete the offenses charged in the Indictment, the defendant needs to intend the transportation,\nenticement, or trafficking of Minor Victims, or agree to do so. Accordingly, any victimization—\nif it occurred—would not necessarily exculpate her or negate her mens rea. And only certain\nlimited evidence would be sufficient to provide a foundation for a duress or coercion defense.\nSee United States v. Zayac, 765 F.3d ll2, l2o (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“The affirmative defense of duress\nexcuses criminal conduct commited under <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> from which a jury may infer that the\ndefendant’s hand was guided not by evil intent, but by the imminent threat of grievous bodily\nharm.”’).\n\nEven if such alleged victimization were probative in some way on an issue at trial, there\nis significant risk that such evidence would be highly prejudicial to the Government and\nconfusing to the jury. It would primarily serve to invite the jury to feel sympathy for the\ndefendant, providing an unlawful basis for jury nullification. At best, it would confuse the jury\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 24 of 69\n\nThe movant bears the burden of proof to shou factors that outweigh the ordinary\npresumption of judicial openness.

Even if the government’s motion was supported by any evidence, “claims of\npublic humiliation and embarrassment” due to “significant media atention. . . are not sufficient\ngrounds for allouing” an accuser to proceed anonymously. ” Doe v.

The right to confront means more than being alloued to confront\nthe witness physically. The main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the\nopponent the opportunity of cross-examination. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 678\n(l986).\n\nHere, the government seeks to strip Ms. Maxwell of her right to confront the witnesses.\nThe identity, occupations, and backgrounds of the accusers is material and relevant to the\ndefense of this case for many reasons.

SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone associated with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. PRE-TRIAL RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a pre-trial ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way. Mot. at l7. Under the government's\napparent view, any credibility challenge will permit any prior statement of the government's\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)). The effect of the 2ol4 Amendment then, as\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006456.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 69\n\nAccordingly, the Florida Investigation will already be a central part of the case presented\nto the jury. It will not be confusing or distracting to elicit evidence of hou that investigation\nconcluded, as the government contends. See Mot. at 27. In fact, the opposite is true. Without\nthat evidence, the jury will be left to speculate hou and when the Florida Investigation ended,\nand whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,\ngiven that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of hou\nthe U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the resolution\nof the investigation. OPR Report at 284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by puting the\nNPA at issue in the trial is therefore illusory. It should not be excluded under Rule 4o3.7°\n° The NPA is also not hearsay. It is an agreement that has independent legal significance and is a “verbal\nact” “containing legally operative language affecting the rights of the parties” that does not qualify as\nhearsay.

See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oll) (emphasis added, alteration in original,\ncitation omited), nor do the other cases.\n\nEven if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of\nBrady material, they still would not reach so far.

The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT ....... ee eeeeeeeeeseereteenteteetereeeneee I\nI.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the\n\ntrauma.

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a).

Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology.

Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 84\n” Joseph, 542 F.3d at 2l-22 (first and second alterations in original) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThat point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases. As Judge Engelmayer explained\nwhen evaluating the testimony of a similar expert in a sex trafficking case, analyzing error rates is\nan “unusually poor fit” in this area:\n\n[S]tudying the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and psychological drivers of trafficked\n\nwomen is not like studying diseases or potential cures in laboratory\n\nanimals. . . . Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a\n\nstudy, given the small size of the populations under review, and\n\ngiven the inherently individualized <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented by\n\ndifferent perpetrators, victims, and contexts in this tumultuous and\n\nemotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the vocabulary of\n\nerror rates . . . is an unusually poor fit... . The testing that has been\n\ndone as to trauma bonding and coercive control, instead, necessarily\n\nuses more qualitative research methodologies. These involve\n\ninterviews and case studies and clinical examinations conducted\n\nover time.”\nFeb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 29:4-3o:2o, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No.\n335. Because statistical rigor is not a useful method for evaluating the reliability of qualitative\nresearch like Dr. Rocchio’s, statistical tools like error rates are irrelevant to the Daubert analysis.\n\nContrary to the defendant’s next claim, these opinions are not “impregnable for purposes\nof cross examination.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross\nexamination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed. The defense can\nalso make arguments—in cross examination and in jury addresses—about the lack of quantitative\nrigor in this qualitative area of science. That is the point: it is for the jury, after hearing the\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties. See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6736\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 84\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo674o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006742.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 84\nexhibits, all of which were in the Government’s discovery productions. The Government also\nprovided the defense with Jencks Act materials for all trial witnesses that same day, including\ndetailed notes and reports of the Government’s interviews of the witness referenced in the leter.\n\nThe defendant nou moves to exclude this evidence, arguing, among other things, that the\nGovernment has not provided sufficient notice of the evidence it intends to offer at trial under Rule\n4o4(b). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant’s motion lacks merit, and should be denied.\nThe Government has provided detailed notice, well in advance of trial. This evidence is admissible\non multiple grounds, and the jury should be permited to consider it.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nRelevant evidence is “not confined to that which directly establishes an element of the\ncrime.” United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l, 942 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second Circuit has\nexplained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only tend to prove the government’s case, and evidence\nthat adds context and dimension to the government’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.”\nId.; accord United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d l553, l56l (2d Cir. l99l). The Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly held that actions and statements are admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged,\nand are “not considered other crimes evidence under” Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), if (a) they\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are\n“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see also United\nStates v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 9o, 93-94\n(2d Cir. 2oo3). In those <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6742\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 62 of 84\ncharged in the S2 indictment.”), and Order at 3, Dkt. No. 335 (follouing the above sentence with\n“Tn light of the interests discussed above . . . the Court will require the Government to disclose the\nidentities of any unnamed co-conspirators... .”).\n\nThe defense also argues that failure to provide an index of co-conspirator statements\npermits “the presentation of false testimony” and is “‘an invitation to manufacture evidence,”\nbecause a witness will offer a co-conspirator statement for the first time. (Def. Mot. l at 4). This\nargument is nonsensical and offensive. It is deeply unfortunate that defense counsel would so\ncasually resort to baseless allegations that the Government would manufacture evidence and\npresent false testimony at trial. And in any event, the Government produced to the defense Jencks\nAct material containing co-conspirator statements in its possession on October ll and will\ncontinue to make Jencks Act productions as it prepares for trial. To the extent the defense is\nconcemed that a witness will say something on the stand for the first time, the Government cannot\ndisclose that in advance because no lawyer can knou a witness’s verbatim answer in advance. But\nwere that to occur, the defense would be well positioned to cross-examine the witness. !°\n'S The defendant’s motion also makes the puzzling argument that co-conspirator statements are\nproblematic in this case because the defense is limited in its ability to call co-conspirators to testify\nas defense witnesses. (Def. Mot. l at 4). That is true in essentially every criminal case, as the\nCourt has previously noted. (See Op. & Order at l7-l8, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“There are also serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”)).\nIn any event, to the extent the defense takes issue with the rule that co-conspirator statements can\nbe admited without requiring the declarant to testify, that complaint is properly directed to the\ndrafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo677o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 66 of 84\n\nMinor Victim-4 identified photo ff as possibly depicting the defendant, but indicated that\nshe was not sure.

FT\neer\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the identification was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4.

She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened.

McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey.

Large-scale national probability studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

This understanding in turn helps us identify those <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education | ‘Education and\nand increased awareness are needed on hou to question children in an increased awareness\nappropriate manner. McElvaney (2oo8) noted that questions did not need to\nbe about sexual abuse per se, but rather questions prompted by the young are needed on hou to\nperson’s psychological distress, asking after the young people’s wellbeing. | question children in\nThis questioning in effect acted as an external pressure for the young person | an appropriate\nto tell his/her secret (McElvaney ef al., 2ol2). In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator.

Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v.

Evid. 9ol(b)(l) and (4).\n\nHere, the testimony of Employee-l establishes the authenticity of Government Exhibit 52.\nIn particular, the fact that Employee-l recognizes this exhibit and can identify it as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its “distinctive characteristics” is all that Rule 9ol requires. Indeed, the\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the admission of evidence under similar <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, where, as\nhere, the Government does not offer evidence at trial about hou the exhibit came into the\nGovernment’s possession. In United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order), the defendant argued that the Government had failed to establish the authenticity\nof “handwriten leters that were found in a USB drive that was handed to an agent of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” Jd. at 24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge.\n“Although the Government did not present evidence regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6966\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\nseizure of the USB drive, Federal Rule of Evidence 9ol(b)(4) permits authentication based on\n‘[t]he appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the\nitem, taken together with all the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.’” /d. (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Evid\n9ol(b)(4)). Witness testimony about the content of the leters was “sufficient to pass the relatively\nlou bar for authentication of evidence,” and the Second Circuit explained that “any remaining\nquestions as to the reliability of the leters go to their evidentiary weight, not their admissibility.”\nId. at 24-25; see United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 67 (2d Cir. l983), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Nat'l Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 5lo U.S. 249 (l994) (leter’s contents were\nsufficient to authenticate it under Rule 9ol(b)(4)).\n\nThe same is true here. Employee-l will identify Government Exhibit 52 as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its appearance and contents. Moreover, Employee-l’s testimony will be\ncorroborated by the contents of the book itself, which includes (a) contact information for the\ndefendant’s family, and (b) contact information for victims who interacted with the defendant\nduring the relevant time period. That is more than sufficient to establish the authenticity of the\nexhibit under Rule 9ol. To the extent the defense disputes Employee-l’s testimony, or takes issue\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> under which Government Exhibit 52 came into the Government’s\npossession,* those arguments are for the jury. The anticipated testimony satisfies Rule 9ol, and\nthe evidence should be admited.\n\n3 Tt is a mater of public record that in 2oo9, an employee of Jeffrey Epstein, Alfredo Rodriguez,\natempted to sell Government Exhibit 52 to a plaintiffs atorney. The atorney contacted the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and agents seized Government Exhibit 52 from Rodriguez, who\nwas arrested. Rodriguez has stated that he took the book from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nduring his employment for Epstein from 2oo4 to early 2oo5. Government Exhibit 52 has remained\nin the possession of the FBI since that time. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and\nacknouledged that he was obligated to turn this evidence over to the FBI years earlier, when he\nwas interviewed during the course of the FBI’s investigation of Epstein. See United States v.\nAlfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM). Rodriguez passed away follouing the conclusion of the\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 457 _ Filed ll/l3/2l Page6of8\nPage 6\nB.

Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l,\n942 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second Circuit has explained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only\ntend to prove the government’s case, and evidence that adds context and dimension to the\ngovernment’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.” Jd.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 52 is plainly relevant.

In\neither scenario, says the government, Dr. Dietz can’t testify.

Dr. Loftus’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to present cases where memory testimony was\nprecluded. Excepting one civil negligence claim based on exposure to sexual abuse, the cases\ncited by the government almost exclusively focus on reliability of eyewitness testimony or failed\nmemory regarding specific time or documents. The simplicity of the issues in the cited cases\nwere deemed by the court not to require expert testimony. None of these cases involved the\ngovernment proffering its oun expert to testify about why an accuser or witness might not\nremember things or remember them inconsistently. Moreover, the cases recognize that, in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> like those present in this case, even absent a government “trauma/memory”\nwitness, defense expert testimony is appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Heine, No. 3:l5-CR-\noo238-SI-2, 2ol7 WL 526o784, at *2 (D. Or. Nov. l3, 2ol7) (expert testimony regarding\nmemory would be alloued if the case involved issues of suggestive questioning, drug use,\nhallucinations, or repressed or recovered memories).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 22 of 28\nSciences was asked to conduct a thorough study of scientific research relating to eyewitness\ntestimony and memory.

The government does not explain hou it can be fair to oppose the testimony\nof an actual memory expert.\n\nAccording to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is\nproper under Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 because:\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,\n\noften only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may\n\nbe lost. With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in\n\nthe context of fear and trauma cause people to narrou their focus to the most salient\n\nand relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it\n\nis very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although\n\nthe victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where\n\nthe abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child\n\nsexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in\n\na delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of\n\ndetail when the disclosure finally occurs.\n\nThe validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p l2l-22.\n\nThese are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”\nexpert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts\nsuch as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have\nbeen regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary\nnumber of innocent people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on\nfaulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the\n“memories” incorrect.

Rather, the government claims\ntheir opinions invade the province of the jury or do not “fit” the case. A hearing is not necessary\nor appropriate to resolve the government’s arguments.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 73 of l5972\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl groomed and victimized.\n\n2 THE COURT: So given that there's a history of prior\n\n3 sexual abuse, would that be relevant -- is that relevant for\n\n4 you to understanding whether grooming occurred?\n\n5 THE WITNESS: Not necessarily, because when I'm\n\n6 looking at whether or not grooming occurred and when the\n\n7 literature is looking about whether or not grooming occurred,\n\n8 they're going to look at the specific <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> associated\n9 with whatever it is you're looking at.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel6ofl7\nbecause an expert witness may not “simply transmit . . . hearsay to the jury” or otherwise serve\nas a vehicle for the factual history of the case.

Quite simply, Ms. Maxwell was not asked and did not testify about Exhibit 52 or its\nauthenticity.\n\nThis is no trivial mater. As Mr. Alessi explained in testimony this Court deemed\ninadequate to authenticate the exhibit, Exhibit 52 is not the same as the books he saw during his\nemployment with Mr. Epstein.

Alessi recognized Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to Alessi’s foundation rested largely on Alessi’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52.

See, e.g., Mot., Dkt. No. 39o at\n3; Leter, Dkt. No. 49o. To the extent the Court exercises its gatekeeping function through\nexamination of evidence that the jury is not considering, the Government notes that the defendant\nherself has acknouledged the authenticity of the contact book.\n\nSpecifically, in her April 2ol6 deposition, the defendant was confronted with a document\nthat appears to be a scan of the contact book and some additional pages. (See Exhibit A (Maxwell\nDeposition Ex. l3)). When shoun the scan, the defendant was asked whether she was familiar\nwith the document, and she replied that she was familiar with the “actual document.” (Exhibit B\n(Maxwell Depo. Tr.) at 3l2). She said that she believed “that this is a copy of a stolen document,”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page5of8\n3l4o366, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“The Court is unaware of any authority that authentication of\nemails can only come through a witness with direct knouledge of the drafting, and Defendant\nprovides none.”).\n\nConcluding that Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently authenticates GX 52 follous this\nwell-tread path. Mr. Alessi’s testimony established an intimate familiarity with the distinctive\ndirectories used in the Palm Beach household over many years and during the time period of the\ncharged conspiracy. He testified that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of\nbinding, cover, and information. This testimony of the appearance, content, substance, and other\ndistinctive characteristics of the exhibit is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.”\n\nThe Defense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\nSee Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38. For example, Mr. Alessi was crossed on voir dire that he did\nnot have personal knouledge about the creation of GX 52 or hou the exhibit had been\nmaintained since it was allegedly removed from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknouledged\nthat he would not knou whether GX 52 had been altered in some way, such as whether pages\nhad been added or whether it had been rebound.

But these generalized\nconcerns are present in every high-profile criminal case. They do not present the rare\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that prior courts have found justify the use of pseudonyms. Further, the alleged\nvictims that received pseudonyms during the Government’s case have a statutory right to have\ntheir “dignity and privacy” protected. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(8). The Defense’s witnesses have no\nsimilar right.\n\nPerhaps most analogous to Defendant’s request is United States v. Rainiere, United States\nv. Rainiere, No. l8-CR-2o4Sl (NGG), 2o2l WL 4522298 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2o2l), another\nhigh-profile case involving alleged sexual misconduct. There, after a defendant pled guilty, the\ndefense sought to keep leters submited in support of the defendant at sentencing anonymous,\narguing that anonymity was necessary because “the authors of supportive leters may face\nretribution if their identities are publicly knoun, given the public atention that has been paid to\nthis case” and that failure to do so “will have a chilling effect on individuals who wish to speak\nin support of defendants in other high-profile prosecutions.” /d. at *3-4. The court\nacknouledged the individuals’ “genuine interest in assisting sentencing while remaining out of\nthe public eye themselves,” but concluded that their leters about the defendant did “not involve\ntraditionally private maters” and that the public’s interest in access prevailed. /d. at *4. The\nCourt concludes that the same analysis applies here.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the Defense argues that without pseudonyms, its witnesses may\nrefuse to testify, implicating Ms. Maxwell’s right to present a defense. The Court notes the late-\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 6 of 24 l8\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl used to \"atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the\n2 investigation.\"\n\n3 That holding has only limited relevance here. First,\n4 the statement at issue in Kyles was probative because it\n\nS suggested the defendant's innocence, not because it was\n\n6 evidence of the reasons for the charging decision or the\n\n7 investigation's timeline.\n\n8 Second, the Second Circuit in Watson v.

We do not think Rule 6l3(a) was intended to take away\n\nthe district judge's discretion to manage the trial in a way designed to promote\n\naccuracy and fairness; and while it would be wrong for a judge to say, “In my court\n\nwe apply the common law rule, not Rule 6l3(a),” he is entitled to conclude that in\n\nparticular <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> the older approach should be used in order to avoid\n\nconfusing witnesses and jurors\nId. at l2ll; see also Sloman vy.

Accordingly, the Court should follou the approach described in\nMarks.\n\nSecond, if a witness admits making an inconsistent statement in 35oo material, the witness\nis thereby impeached, and there is no need for further extrinsic evidence. See United Sates v.\nRivera-Donate, 682 F.3d l2o, l27 (lst Cir. 2ol2) (concluding that a prior statement is not even\ninconsistent where the witness acknouledges and explains the inconsistency); United States v.\nSoundingsides, 825 F.2d l468, l47o (loth Cir. l987) (denying petition for rehearing). But see\nUnited States v. Strother, 49 F.3d 869, 876 (2d Cir. l995) (“Extrinsic evidence of a prior\ninconsistent statement is more persuasive to a jury than a witness’s acknouledgement of\ninconsistencies in a prior statement.”).! It is irrelevant that the witness then chooses to stand by\nher trial testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government believes the statements at Tr. 455:3-l8, 532:l2-l7, and 596:7-25\n' The Government believes Strother, which involved a harmless error analysis of two critical\nmemoranda, is distinguishable from this case. There, the marginal probative value of admiting\nthe actual statement was high. Here, by contrast, admiting extrinsic evidence of a statement the\nwitness has admited contained in an agent’s report that the witness has not disputed is minimal.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo842o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page2of3\nand Shawn, and their prior convictions were only discussed briefly during their direct testimony—\nand not at all on cross-examination.

Because the proposed instruction at most reflects brief testimony by only two\nwitnesses, it is appropriate to provide, at most, a similarly brief and balanced treatment of the\ninstruction.\n\nSecond, the Government opposes the removal of “equally” from the standard instruction\nregarding uncalled witnesses. During the charge conference, the defense argued that some\nwitnesses were not “equally” available because they would or did invoke their protection against\nself-incrimination. Many circuits have held, houever, that “despite the government’s pouer to\ngrant immunity, a witness invoking his constitutional rights is unavailable to the government as\nwell as the defense.” United States v.

See Press Enterprise Co. v.\nSuperior Court of California, 464 U.S. 5ol, 5o8 (l984) (“Press Enterprise I’). The presumption\nof openness can only be overcome if “specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating\nthat closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that\ninterest.” Press—Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. l, l3-l4 (l986) (“Press-Enterprise\nIl’). Under this standard, the presumption in favor of access to court proceedings and records\nrequires \"the most compelling <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\" to justify any restriction upon that right. In re\nApplication of Nat'l B'casting Co., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o).\n\nThe reasons why the documents in question should be unsealed have been clearly set\nforth in the submissions by the other media entities. The Daily News would simply emphasize\nthat the right of access applies fully to post-trial proceedings, including motions for a new trial\nand accompanying exhibits and memoranda. See, e.g., United States v. Donato, 7l4 F. App’x\n75, 76 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (concluding that documents atached to motion for a new\ntrial were judicial documents subject to right of access and holding that district court abused its\ndiscretion in refusing to unseal documents); United States v. Gonzalez, 927 F. Supp. 768, 784\n(D. Del. l996) (“the public, through its surrogate, the press, has a right of access to the post-trial\nbriefs and appendix filed in support of defendant’s Motion for a New Trial’’); United States v.\n\n' Non-parties such as the Daily News have standing to intervene in criminal proceedings to assert\nthe public’s right of access.

Throughout the course of\nthis case (as in most if not every case), the parties have publicly litigated evidentiary issues\nimplicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their counsel could access the briefing if they\nso wished. In this case, the parties publicly filed significant pre-trial briefing, including pre-trial\nmotions and motions in /imine, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in\nmotions in limine, the parties litigated the legal contours of the testimony of the witness who\ntestified under the pseudonym Kate, as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of Carolyn’s identification of the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 387, 392, 397. Neither the Government nor the defendant sought\nto file such documents under seal; the defendant certainly did not claim that such documents should\nbe temporarily sealed because Government witnesses could access such filings (or news articles\nabout such filings) and accordingly tailor their trial testimony. There is no reason that the Defense\nMotion should be treated differently and litigated entirely under seal.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the public docketing of the Defense Motion will enable\nJuror 5o to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only inconsistent with the foregoing practice\nin this (like every) case, but it is also unsupported by any legal authority. (Def. Leter at 2). The\ndefendant’s reliance on cases involving pre-trial publicity is inapposite. Those cases concern the\nright to a fair ‘rial, and, in those cases, sealing is proper upon specific findings that, inter alia,\n“there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by\npublicity ....” United States v.

Such a release will allou Juror 5o to comply with Judge Nathan’s Order from\nJanuary o5, 2o22. Additionally, since the Jury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript will remain\nunder seal, with the limited expectations requested herein, this Court need not be concerned\nabout the risks that may be posed by full disclosure of the same, and therefore does not need to\nconsider the risks of widespread disclosure in deciding the instant motion.\n\nWhile the court was right to seal the Jury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript from the\npublic given the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the trial, the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> have changes since that time.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred.

Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no reasonable dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual assault and\nsexual abuse as a child. Necessarily, then, Juror No. 5o did not provide truthful answers\nwhen he denied being the victim of a crime (Question 25) or being a victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault (Question 48).\n\nAnd because being a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse is material to an\nindividual’s ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in a case about sexual assault and\nsexual abuse, Ms. Maxwell has satisfied the first prong of the McDonough test. See\nUnited States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l72 (D.

First, bias should be\nimplied because this is a case in which “there are similarities between the personal\nexperiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at\n472. “When a juror has life experiences that correspond with evidence presented during\nthe trial, that congruence raises obvious concerns about the juror’s possible bias.”\nSampson v.

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law. Cf.\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 288 (l999) (“[U]nder Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has\nthe same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment. ‘If the suppression\nof evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the\ncharacter of the prosecutor.’”) (internal citation omited).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited).

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and impartial. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 27 of 49\n\nKeeping with that “narrou” view of implied bias, the Second Circuit has “consistently\nrefused to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions that jurors be excused for cause\ndue to certain occupational or other special relationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of a given case, where . . . there is no shouing of actual bias or prejudice.”\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quotations and citations omited). For example, the Second Circuit has\ndeclined to follou a Ninth Circuit precedent stating that it was error not to excuse two bank tellers\nas jurors in a bank robbery case. United States v. Broun, 644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)\n(declining to follou United States v. Allsup, 566 F.2d 68 (9th Cir. l977)); see also Mikus v. United\nStates, 433 F.2d 7l9, 724 (2d Cir. l97o) (similar). And it has held that a juror’s prior service at a\ntrial involving similar but unrelated offenses which involved the testimony of a common witness\ndoes not give rise to implied bias. See United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d Cir. l99l);\nsee also Curry v. Lynch, 323 F. App’x 63, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (rejecting argument that a juror had\nimplied bias because he ouned a printing business that did business with defense counsel).\n\nHere, there is no suggestion that Juror 5o is related to a party in this case, or that he is a\nvictim of or has any personal knouledge of the defendant’s crimes. Accordingly, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case do not fall within the narrou categories of implied bias that the Second\nCircuit has recognized. This is not one of the rare, extreme <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where a mandatory\npresumption of bias may be applied. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nThe defendant principally argues that implied bias should be found based on alleged\nsimilarities between the personal experiences of Juror 5o and the issues being litigated. (Def.\nMem. at 3o-35). But the Second Circuit has not recognized this as a proper basis to make a finding\nof mandatory, presumed bias. Indeed, it has specifically rejected such a notion:\n\nJust as we have refused to carve out an overly broad category of\npresumed bias based on occupational or status relationships, so we\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 49\nserve as jurors in such cases, the defendant would have cited case law that actually supports that\nproposition.\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that bias should be implied because she alleges that Juror\n5o has repeatedly lied. (Def. Mem. at 35-36 (citing Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472)). As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the record does not support this, and, as a result, this is a far cry\nfrom the extreme <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in Daugerdas, where Judge Pauley concluded after a hearing that\nthe juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury” and was “a pathological\nliar who does not knou the difference between truth and lie.” /d. at 473, 475.\n\nThe record also does not support the defendant’s atempt to compare Juror 5o to Juror 55,\n7 As noted above, there is no evidence that Juror 5o LF\na. Moreover, the defendant’s analogy misunderstands the nature of the current inquiry, in\nwhich the Court must consider the hypothetical question whether, if the juror had truthfully\nanswered the relevant question, the Court would have struck him for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d\n\nIn sum, the defendant has failed to establish implied bias.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).

(Juror 5o Mem. at 4). The defendant opposes Juror\n5o’s request, describing it as a “discovery request” and claiming that the release of Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaire would prejudice the “investigation” of Juror 5o’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color\nJuror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible posture.” (Def. Mem.\nat 52-53). As an initial mater, the Government notes that Juror 5o’s voir dire was conducted in\nopen court and is therefore available to Juror 5o and his counsel. As to the request for his\nquestionnaire, the Government submits that Juror 5o should get a copy of his oun questionnaire.\n\nThe defendant has characterized Juror 5o’s request for his oun questionnaire as a\n“discovery request,” but Juror 5o is not a defendant and he is not seeking discovery.!® He is asking\nfor access to his questionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of\nperjury, and which, nou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely\nto protect his oun privacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,\nRiverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require\nlimiting access to Juror 5o’s questionnaire plainly do not apply to Juror 5o himself or his counsel.'?\n'8 The defendant claims that courts have “refused discovery to individuals or entities under\ninvestigation” “[u]nder analogous <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that\nargument, the defendant cites only John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46 (l989),\nwhich is clearly not analogous as it involved a request under the Freedom of Information Act and\nan ongoing grand jury proceeding.\n\n' On January 24, 2o22, the New York Times Company moved to unseal, among other things, the\nfilled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to\naddress that motion on or before February ll, 2o22 in accordance with the Court’s January 26,\n2o22 order (Dkt. No. 585).\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l4 of 32\nin a “documentary.” Inquiring into the false answers Juror No. 5o has publicly admited making\nrisks nothing that Juror No. 5o hasn’t already brought on himself.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s motion has nothing to do with her innocence or guilt. It involves no\nstrategy or artifice by the defense. And it risks no unauthorized inquiry into the jury room. The\nmotion is about one thing, and one thing only: Every person’s constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury. The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making. In turn, the government’s policy arguments\nbetray the weakness of its legal position. And they cast significant doubt on the United States\nsolemn duty to seek justice and not merely to convict.

Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v.

Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had challenged Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have challenged Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.

The questioning should encompass any topic on which actual bias\nmay be based.\n\nMoreover, the questioning should be significantly broader than proposed by the\ngovernment. Although Ms. Maxwell need not prove Juror No. 5o’s intent, whether he acted\ndeliberately is “is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias. . . .”\nGreer, 285 F.3d at l73. An analysis of Juror No. 5o’s intent requires consideration of the totality\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. And if only because Juror No. 5o has a patern and practice of giving false\nanswers to the Court, Ms. Maxwell is not required to accept any post-hoc assertion by him that\nhe did not act deliberately.

Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see {l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009455.jpg": "Case l{2oser4oo33o& ABcurDoecureat 6lo9/2o Filed G@z2ah PagPaged 36 of ll7\n‘A-585l\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 9 of 29\nThe Court: All right.

Guzman Loera, 24 F.4th at l6l\n(quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).\n\nSecond, Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6 bars the Court from considering Juror 5o’s\nstatements as evidence of another juror’s statements purportedly made during deliberations. As\npreviously quoted, the rule states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n\ntestify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\n\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any\n\njuror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court may not\n\nreceive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these maters.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l).\n\nRule 6o6(b) is subject to three enumerated exceptions that permit a juror to testify about\nwhether (A) “extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s atention”;\n(B) “an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror”; or (C) “a mistake was\nmade in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2). In addition to these\nexceptions enumerated in the rule, the Supreme Court has held that Rule 6o6 “give[s] way”\nwhere “a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or\nanimus to convict a criminal defendant.” Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, l37 S. Ct. 855, 863\n(2ol7). Absent one of these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, evidence within the ambit of Rule 6o6 may not be\nconsidered.\n\nHere, the Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements of what another juror allegedly stated\nduring deliberations. That proffer is barred by Rule 6o6.\n\nIn response, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror fall\noutside the scope of Rule 6o6 because she “does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9553\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page4of5l\n33(a).! “The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule\n33[.]” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2oo9). Because motions for a new\ntrial are strongly disfavored, “the standard for granting such a motion is strict,” United States v.\nGambino, 59 F.3d 353, 364 (2d Cir. l995), and it should be granted “sparingly and in the most\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, and only in order to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.” United\nStates v. Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9). In deciding the motion, courts “should\ngenerally defer to the jury’s resolution of conflicting evidence and assessment of witness\ncredibility.” United States v. Landesman, l7 F 4th 298, 33o (2d Cir. 2o2l). The “ultimate test on\na Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would be a manifest injustice.” United\nStates v. Peters, 843 F.

The Defendant Was Convicted of the Crimes Charged in the Indictment, So No\nConstructive Amendment or Variance Occurred\n\nIn her motion, the defendant claims that the Government’s proof at trial differed from the\n\ncrimes charged in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “S2 Indictment” or “Indictment’’), and\n\nthat the Government therefore constructively amended Counts One, Three, and Four of the\n\nIndictment. Not so. At all times—before trial, in its presentation of the evidence, at closing\n\nargument, and in seeking jury instructions—the Government consistently argued that the\n\n' Unless otherwise noted, case text quotations omit all internal quotation marks, citations, and\nalterations.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9566\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2lof5l\n“almost invariable assumption of the law . . . that jurors follou their instructions”). Accordingly,\neven if the jury note suggests some confusion, the Court’s response did not constructively amend\nthe S2 Indictment. See Jones, 847 F. App’x at 3o (finding no constructive amendment in a sex\ntrafficking case where the indictment did not contain the verb “advertise” but the evidence included\nevidence of advertising and the Court mistakenly used that verb in parts of the instructions, because\nthe advertising evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and the Court otherwise\ncorrectly instructed the jury); Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“The jury instructions described a\nconspiracy substantially the same as the one charged in the indictment.”).\n\nThird, the defendant’s argument is beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to\nthe jury note or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment\nargument. See, e.g., United States v. Muraca, 8o3 F. Appx’ 545, 546 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“[T]he trial\ncourt enjoys considerable discretion construing the scope of a jury inquiry and in framing a\nresponse tailored to the inquiry,” and “If a supplemental charge is legally correct, the district court\nenjoys broad discretion in determining hou, and under what <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, that charge will be\ngiven.”). Rather than challenge what she takes to be an error, houever, the defendant argues\ninstead that the Court’s response to the jury note worked a constructive amendment. In so doing,\nthe defendant must surmount the high bar of shouing that, notwithstanding the focus of the trial\nevidence, the Court’s limiting instructions at trial, and the Court’s jury instructions taken as a\nwhole, the Court’s response to the jury note “so modified] essential elements of the offense that\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other\nthan that charged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant contends that she has suffered substantial prejudice due to the death of\ncertain witnesses and the unavailability of certain documentary records. (Def. Mot. at 25-3o). The\ndefendant’s speculative claims fail to establish substantial and actual prejudice caused by the\nallegedly excessive pre-indictment delay. See Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6.\n\nThe defendant claims she has suffered substantial prejudice as a result of pre-indictment\ndelay due to the unavailability of (l) Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi, architects who worked for\nEpstein; (2) Sally Markham, “a property manager hired to help run Epstein’s properties in the early\n2ooos”; and (3) Lynn Fontanilla, the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s New York tounhouse. (Def.\nMot. at 29-3o).? The defendant’s speculative claims of prejudice do not withstand scrutiny. First,\nthe fact that certain deceased witnesses cannot testify does not compel a finding of actual prejudice.\n“TUJnavailable witnesses are inherent in any delay, even if justifiable. To merit dismissal a\ndefendant must demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.” United\n’ The defendant also reasserts that the witnesses “already mentioned in [her] previous filings”—\nnamely, Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein’s mother, Michael Casey (the alleged agent of Minor Victim-l),\nand Palm Beach Police Department Detective Joseph Recarey—‘could have provided evidence\ncontradicting the government’s proof.” (Def. Mot. at 29). The Court already rejected the\ndefendant’s claims of actual prejudice as to these witnesses, finding that the defendant “provide[d]\nno indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to” and noting “serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”\n(Dkt. No. 2o7 at l8). The defendant offers no new arguments as to these witnesses, and her claims\ncertainly fare no beter after the trial in this mater.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 638 Filed o3/o9/22 Page 4 of 29 |\n; Juror ID: e) © 7\n|\nPLEASE ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: |\nABILITY TO SERVE 7\nPlease note: In the event you are excused from service on this jury, you will likely |\nnot be excused from jury service in general.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial.

Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred.

Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v.

Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and impartial. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 27 of 49\n\nKeeping with that “narrou” view of implied bias, the Second Circuit has “consistently\nrefused to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions that jurors be excused for cause\ndue to certain occupational or other special relationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of a given case, where . . . there is no shouing of actual bias or prejudice.”\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quotations and citations omited). For example, the Second Circuit has\ndeclined to follou a Ninth Circuit precedent stating that it was error not to excuse two bank tellers\nas jurors in a bank robbery case. United States v. Broun, 644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)\n(declining to follou United States v. Allsup, 566 F.2d 68 (9th Cir. l977)); see also Mikus v. United\nStates, 433 F.2d 7l9, 724 (2d Cir. l97o) (similar). And it has held that a juror’s prior service at a\ntrial involving similar but unrelated offenses which involved the testimony of a common witness\ndoes not give rise to implied bias. See United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d Cir. l99l);\nsee also Curry v. Lynch, 323 F. App’x 63, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (rejecting argument that a juror had\nimplied bias because he ouned a printing business that did business with defense counsel).\n\nHere, there is no suggestion that Juror 5o is related to a party in this case, or that he is a\nvictim of or has any personal knouledge of the defendant’s crimes. Accordingly, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case do not fall within the narrou categories of implied bias that the Second\nCircuit has recognized. This is not one of the rare, extreme <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where a mandatory\npresumption of bias may be applied. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nThe defendant principally argues that implied bias should be found based on alleged\nsimilarities between the personal experiences of Juror 5o and the issues being litigated. (Def.\nMem. at 3o-35). But the Second Circuit has not recognized this as a proper basis to make a finding\nof mandatory, presumed bias. Indeed, it has specifically rejected such a notion:\n\nJust as we have refused to carve out an overly broad category of\npresumed bias based on occupational or status relationships, so we\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 49\nserve as jurors in such cases, the defendant would have cited case law that actually supports that\nproposition.\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that bias should be implied because she alleges that Juror\n5o has repeatedly lied. (Def. Mem. at 35-36 (citing Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472)). As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the record does not support this, and, as a result, this is a far cry\nfrom the extreme <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in Daugerdas, where Judge Pauley concluded after a hearing that\nthe juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury” and was “a pathological\nliar who does not knou the difference between truth and lie.” /d. at 473, 475.\n\nThe record also does not support the defendant’s atempt to compare Juror 5o to Juror 55,\nwho was dismissed for cause foe\nee\n7 As noted above, there is no evidence that Juror 5o lied about his social media\naccounts. Moreover, the defendant’s analogy misunderstands the nature of the current inquiry, in\nwhich the Court must consider the hypothetical question whether, if the juror had truthfully\nanswered the relevant question, the Court would have struck him for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d\na post-verdict posture, if the Court were to find that Juror 5o intentionally lied about using social\nmedia accounts, the question would be whether the Court would have struck him if he had\ntruthfully answered that question. There is nothing in the record about Juror 5o’s use of social\nmedia accounts that would have supported a challenge for cause at voir dire.\n\nIn sum, the defendant has failed to establish implied bias.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).

(Juror 5o Mem. at 4). The defendant opposes Juror\n5o’s request, describing it as a “discovery request” and claiming that the release of Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaire would prejudice the “investigation” of Juror 5o’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color\nJuror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible posture.” (Def. Mem.\nat 52-53). As an initial mater, the Government notes that Juror 5o’s voir dire was conducted in\nopen court and is therefore available to Juror 5o and his counsel. As to the request for his\nquestionnaire, the Government submits that Juror 5o should get a copy of his oun questionnaire.\n\nThe defendant has characterized Juror 5o’s request for his oun questionnaire as a\n“discovery request,” but Juror 5o is not a defendant and he is not seeking discovery.!® He is asking\nfor access to his questionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of\nperjury, and which, nou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely\nto protect his oun privacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,\nRiverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require\nlimiting access to Juror 5o’s questionnaire plainly do not apply to Juror 5o himself or his counsel.'?\n'8 The defendant claims that courts have “refused discovery to individuals or entities under\ninvestigation” “[u]nder analogous <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that\nargument, the defendant cites only John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46 (l989),\nwhich is clearly not analogous as it involved a request under the Freedom of Information Act and\nan ongoing grand jury proceeding.\n\n' On January 24, 2o22, the New York Times Company moved to unseal, among other things, the\nfilled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to\naddress that motion on or before February ll, 2o22 in accordance with the Court’s January 26,\n2o22 order (Dkt.

The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making. In turn, the government’s policy arguments\nbetray the weakness of its legal position. And they cast significant doubt on the United States\nsolemn duty to seek justice and not merely to convict.

Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v.

Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had challenged Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have challenged Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009895.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 26 of 32\n2. The questioning should encompass any topic on which actual bias\nmay be based.\n\nMoreover, the questioning should be significantly broader than proposed by the\ngovernment. Although Ms. Maxwell need not prove Juror No. 5o’s intent, whether he acted\ndeliberately is “is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias. . . .”\nGreer, 285 F.3d at l73. An analysis of Juror No. 5o’s intent requires consideration of the totality\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. And if only because Juror No. 5o has a patern and practice of giving false\nanswers to the Court, Ms. Maxwell is not required to accept any post-hoc assertion by him that\nhe did not act deliberately. Cf United States v. James, 6o9 F.2d 36, 46 (2d Cir. l979) (“[W]hen\natempting to shou bias or interest, as opposed to bad reputation, the examiner is not bound to\naccept the witness’ answer, but is free to call additional witnesses for impeachment.”).\n\nThe government disingenuously suggests that the Court \"need not inquire about the\ndetails of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did not probe such details with respect to\nother jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively.\" Resp. at 34 n.l6. Apparently the\ngovernment has forgoten that Question 48a itself (approved of by the government) asked for\ndetails of any affirmative answer to Question 48, and each of the other jurors who answered 48\nin the affirmative provided those details in writen form when they answered Question 48a.\nThere was thus no need for the Court to inquire the details during the live voir dire. For\nexample, the government points to Juror l89 and notes the Court only folloued up with the\nquestion whether a question concerning ability to be fair and impartial. Resp. at 36. Yet Juror\nl89’s answer to 48a contained the details of her alleged abusc\neS\nee.

If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by\nthe lawyer has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to knou of its\nfalsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if\nnecessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence,\nother than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal mater, that the lawyer\nreasonably believes is false.\n(b) A lawyer who represents a client before a tribunal and who knous that a\nperson intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent\nconduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures,\nincluding, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.\n8. Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010134.jpg": "Cada it 2o2 Or enockkeeD AS NL eminent G6 S32 Aiba OOP Rak ays BSF afll/l 7\nA-585l\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 9 of 29\nThe Court: All right.

Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial demonstrated that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”). These objective\nfacts indicate that the jury remained impartial.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to demonstrate actual bias is fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No. 643\nat 2l (citing Smith v. Phillips, 45 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982), for the proposition that the remedy is\nlimited to a hearing for “actual bias” and noting that the Second Circuit has not decided whether\nimplied or inferred bias may be considered in this context)). But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias. (See id. at 27-28). And in any event, Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing demonstrated that\nthe sexual abuse he described experiencing is not particularly similar to the abuse experienced by\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page4ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable\nbias, or actual bias. See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). In determining\nwhether Juror 5o was biased, the Court should consider several factors, including “[l] the\n\nsimilarity between the juror’s experiences and important facts presented at trial, [2] the scope\nand severity of the juror’s dishonesty, and [3] the juror’s motive for lying.” See Sampson v.\nUnited States, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l\" Cir. 2ol3) (citations omited). The record developed at the\nHearing strengthened the already compelling evidence of Juror 5o’s bias and established that,\nhad he answered the questionnaire honestly, he would have been struck for cause.\n\nA. The Similarity Between Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and the Witnesses’ Sexual\n\nAbuse, As Well As His Post-Trial Conduct, Establish Bias.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which significantly\nparalleled the abuse described by the government’s four key victim witnesses at trial. Jury 5o\nhad already disclosed some of these facts in his post-trial press interviews. But the opportunity\nto question Juror 5o further about the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of his abuse at the Hearing—an opportunity\nthat Ms. Maxwell was denied at voir dire because of his false answers to the questionnaire—\nrevealed even more striking similarities to the abuse described by the four victim witnesses at\ntrial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor, (il) was abused on\nmultiple occasions over the course of several years, and (i) delayed reporting the abuse. (Tr. 8-\n9). Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused by two people who were friends and who each\nparticipated in the abuse. (Tr. 8-9). Furthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or\nsexually assaulted by someone he did not knou.

Those answers were self-serving and are of no value to the Court’s analysis of\npotential bias. Indeed, the Second Circuit had recognized that in determining whether implied or\ninferred bias exists, “the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be impartial become\nirrelevant.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. Instead, bias must be determined from the surrounding facts\nand <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>—especially in cases where the juror’s experience closely tracks the trial\nevidence—because “the bias of a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly\nbecause the juror may have an interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror\nmay be unaware of it.’” /d.

Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources.

Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse.

Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l7\n(l982). One important means of ensuring an impartial jury is voir dire examination, which\n“expos[es] possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the part of potential jurors,” by\neliciting information under oath. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548,\n554 (l984).\n\nOnce a jury has returned a verdict, a motion to set aside that verdict is “disfavored” and\nthe moving party must overcome an “exacting hurdle” of proof. United States v. Ventura, No.\no9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4); see United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989). And while Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33\npermits a court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so\nrequires,” Fed. R. Crim.

That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v.

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36.

First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be\nimplied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial. The Defendant’s\nonly in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas. See Maxwell Br. at 3o-35;\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5. In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias\n‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being\nlitigated.’” 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l64\n(D. Mass. 2oll)). But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias\nbecause that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed\nabove) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and\ncreation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrou category.\nThe circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions\nthat jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which\nmight bear directly or indirectly on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of a given case, where . . . there is no\nshouing of actual bias or prejudice.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Broun,\n644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d\nCir. l99l). As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ntrial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that\nwere similar to conduct charged in the case. l28 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]Juch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\na2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” Jd. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l.

R. Civ. P. 33(a). Such a motion is granted “sparingly and in the most\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, and only in order to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.”\nUnited States v. Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D ’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n* The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same.

United States, 555 U.S. 35o, 352 (2oo9).\nRather, after calculating the appropriate guidelines range, sentencing courts must consider the\n§3553(a) factors, make an individualized assessment, and impose a sentence that is “sufficient, but\nnot greater than necessary” to meet the objectives of sentencing. § 3553(a); Gall, 552 U.S. at 5o\nn.6.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\nThe 3553(a) factors include, among other things:\n\nl. the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense and the history and characteristics\nof the defendant;\n\n2. the need for the sentence imposed\n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law,\nand to provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant;\n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,\nmedical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;\n(E) to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and\n\n3. the kinds of sentences available.\n\nIn this case, we respectfully submit that the § 3553(a) factors—including Ms. Maxwell’s\n“history and characteristics,” the need for the sentence imposed to provide “just punishment,” and\nthe need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities - weigh heavily in favor of a sentence\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2o of 77\n\nNor can general deterrence be used to justify a harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell. Probation\nidentifies two groups of potential offenders who will purportedly be deterred from commiting\nfuture crimes as a result of Ms. Maxwell’s sentence: (l) sexual predators who exploit and degrade\nminor victims and (2) “untouchable individuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them\nto victimize others without fear or consequence.” PSR at 67. With regard to the first group, courts\nhave expressed legitimate doubt as to whether people who have a sexual predilection for minors\ncan be deterred at all. See, e.g., United States v. D.M., 942 F. Supp. 2d 327, 346 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol3)\n(“[T]he compulsive behavior and disorders motivating many offenders is less susceptible to\ngeneral deterrence.”). With regard to the second group, the purported justification sweeps far too\nbroadly. Rather than identify a particular class of similarly situated defendants who will be\ndeterred from commiting specific crimes, Probation essentially makes the sweeping assertion that\na harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell is necessary to deter rich people from exploiting poor people.\nSee PSR at 67.

Given the foregoing discussion, a shorter term of incarceration for Ms. Maxwell\nbest serves the long-term goals of punishment. A significantly belou-guidelines sentence in this\ncase would also promote respect for the law by demonstrating that the justice system considers\neach person who comes before the Court as an individual.

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4o of55\nidentified a total of thirty-two minor victims, including Carolyn and Virginia.’ Of those thirty-\ntwo individuals, thirteen appear in the message pads, again including Carolyn and Virginia.\n\nThe Government notes that, from interviewing many of these victims during the course of\nits investigation, the Government has learned that, in the later phases of the conspiracy, victims\nprimarily scheduled appointments with—and interfaced with—Epstein’s personal assistants, who\nwere in their early twenties.® Although the Government does not seek to include these minors as\nvictims for purposes of the Guidelines calculation, the scope of the pyramid scheme that the\ndefendant helped devise with Epstein bears emphasis when evaluating the harms that the\ndefendant’s criminal conduct ultimately caused.\n\nVictim Impact\n\nIt is difficult to capture in words the harm that Maxwell caused to her victims.

Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia Giuffre’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my consideration, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A. Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, 44 HOFSTRA\nL. REv. 429 (2ol6)); and as a member and chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards\n\nl\nSDNY_GM_o2775899\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo654\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Pagel6 of 2l\nrole in the New York crimes of an expansive long-running sex traficking conspiracy, Maxwell's\ncriminal prosecution does not stand in a vacuum.

But many questions remain about hou and why\nthe innumerable co-conspirators in an extensive international child sex trafficking operation have\nescaped justice for so long. In the Southern District of Florida, Epstein, Maxwell, and other co—\nconspirators arranged a secret non—prosecution deal that alloued Epstein to, in effect, take the fall\nfor all involved and then to serve most of his prison time on “work release’—while the other co—\nconspirators (such as Maxwell) escaped prosecution entirely. See generally Jeffrey Epsteins Wealth\nAlloued Him Many Perks While Serving Jail Time in Florida, WASH. POST (July l9, 2ol9). The\n“preposterous” inexplicable non—prosecution agreement has left the sex trafficking conspiracy’s\nvictims—and the public—to wonder why Epstein, Maxwell, and other co-conspirators were treated\nso favorably.

And Epstein’s escape from conviction through apparent suicide in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where federal authorities should have been more vigilant has created a widely spread\nmeme that “Epstein didn’t kill himself”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, if Maxwell’s victims are prevented from speaking at her sentencing, it\nwill compound the public perception that the conspiracy’s victims are being silenced and that co—\nconspirators continue to receive favorable treatment. The best way to dispel this public perception is\nfor the Court to broadly permit a// Maxwell’s victims who wish to be heard at sentencing to speak.\n\nJudge Berman of this Court wisely recognized these realities in allouing all of Epstein’s\nvictims to speak at the court hearing where Epstein’s criminal charges were dismissed after his death.\nSee U.S. v. Epstein, Case No. l9-cr-49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. hearing transcript Aug. 27, 2ol9). As Judge\nBerman explained: “Public hearings are exactly what judges do. Hearings promote transparency and\nthey provide the court with insights and information which the court may not otherwise be aware of.\n‘The victims have been included in the proceeding today both because of their relevant experiences\nand because they should always be involved before rather than after the fact.” Aug. 27, 2ol9, Hrng.\nTrans. at 5.

On Friday, June 24, 2o22, the Warden of the MDC was informed that the\nBureau of Prisons Inspector General’s Office (the “IG”) had received an email directly from the\ndefendant from within the MDC claiming to be in fear for her safety. Apparently the defendant\nclaimed to the IG that she feared MDC staff members were threatening her safety. The Warden\nand the Chief of Psychology felt obligated to remove the defendant from general population and\ninvestigate the defendant’s claim. Ordinarily, an inmate raising such a safety concern would be\nplaced in a single cell of the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”) of the MDC. In <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where\nthe facility is concerned that the inmate is at heightened risk of self-harm, houever, the MDC will\ninstead place the inmate on suicide watch. The Warden and Chief Psychologist indicated that at\nleast two other inmates have recently been placed on suicide watch in similar <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nHere, the Warden and Chief Psychologist assessed that the defendant is at heightened risk\nof self-harm, particularly given her upcoming sentencing and sex offender status. As a result, they\nare not comfortable placing the defendant in the SHU, but they also need to remove the defendant\nfrom general population to investigate the threat she reported to the IG. Accordingly, the defendant\nwas placed on suicide watch. Although the defendant has claimed to psychology staff that she is\nnot suicidal, she has refused to answer psychology staff's questions regarding the threat she\nreported to the IG. While she claimed to the IG to be in fear for her safety, she refused to tell\npsychology staff what that fear is. Given the defendant’s inconsistent accounts to the IG and to\npsychology staff, the Chief Psychologist assesses the defendant to be at additional risk of self-\nharm, as it appears she may be atempting to be transferred to a single cell where she can engage\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo73o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010762.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page 9 of 353 |\n| Juror ID: 2 )\n|\nPLEASE ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: |\nABILITY TO SERVE |\ni\nPlease note: In the event you are excused from service on this jury, you will likely\nnot be excused from jury service in general.

Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, ll5 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (emphasis added);\nUnited States v. Valle, No. l2-CR-847 (PGG), 2ol3 WL 44o687, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2ol3)\n(“Merely identifying the general topics about which the expert will testify is insufficient; rather,\nthe summary must reveal the expert’s actual opinions.”).\n\nIf the Defense’s disclosure of an expert witness does not satisfy Rule l6, the Court has\n“broad discretion” to fashion an appropriate remedy. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5. That discretion\nis guided by factors including “why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if any,\nto the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” /d.

Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these\narguments would only enhance the Rule 4o3 prejudice.\n\nThird, apart from Rule 4ol and 4o3, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman does not\nsatisfy Rule l6. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,\nlike “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at l2. It does not mention\nGershman’s actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the\nDefense’s response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman’s opinions. Def.

Amodeo (Amodeo II), 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l995)).\nAlthough the government claims that the items must remain sealed due to an “ongoing\ninvestigation,” they have failed to explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the\nsame materials they obtained via their ex parte and in camera procedure are being released to\nthe public under the Giuffre unsealing process, without objection from the government. The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to\ndemonstrate that denial of public access is “essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly\ntailored to serve that interest.” United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting\nPress-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4).\nMs. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case\nto determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge\nMcMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have nou become\n“Judicial documents” by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers,\nhouever, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those\nmaterials.\nObjections to Redactions Proposed on Pages l87-l88\nMs. Maxwell also objects to the government’s proposed redactions on pages l87-l88. The\nlanguage at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed\nsupports her allegations.

He will testify that,\nfor many years, the defendant and Epstein maintained copies of a contact book. They had a\npractice of annually updating it. And Alessi can identify Government Exhibit 52 as one of those\nbooks, based on its distinctive characteristics, including its contents, internal paterns, and binding.\nSee Fed. R.

(Cf ll/ol/2l Tr. at 6l (“THE COURT: If the evidence were that it wasn’t created\nor maintained until after the charged conspiracy, is it relevant?”)).

As set forth above,\nFlatley’s testimony does not constitute expert opinion, and thus no notice was required. But even\nif some aspect of Flatley’s testimony were considered expert opinion, the Government’s notice\nwas sufficient, for the reasons set forth above. Furthermore, the purpose of Rule l6’s expert notice\nrequirement is to “minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce\nthe need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of\nthe expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G),\n(b)(l)(C), l993 Amend. Here, the Government’s notices have clearly served the purpose of the\nrequirement. The defendant cannot seriously claim surprise: When the Government first provided\nnotice of Flatley’s testimony in September, the defendant did not object to its sufficiency or file a\nmotion to preclude, but instead noticed her oun counter-expert to Flatley on November l, 2o2l,\nstating that he would testify about substantially the same subjects. Moreover, the first time the\ndefendant raised any complaint about notice, the Government responded in great detail within\nthree days, and the defense then chose to wait until the night before Flatley’s testimony to raise\nany further complaint with the Court. Thus, any need for a continuance—and there is none—is\nthe product of the defendant’s gamesmanship. Preclusion is an extreme remedy, see Ulbricht, 858\nF.3d at ll7; Canada, 858 F. App’x at 439; Ganier, 468 F.3d at 927 (“District courts should\nembrace the ‘least severe sanction necessary’ doctrine, and hold that suppression of relevant\nevidence as a remedial device should be limited to <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which it is necessary to serve\nremedial objectives.”); United States v.

At most, the Court should permit the defense additional time to prepare their cross-\nexamination of Flatley.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that the defendant has given far less detailed expert notice\nthan the Government has, despite the Court’s order for the defendant to supplement her expert\nnotice. (See ll/23/2l Tr. at 25 (directing the defense to supplement their notice by November\n27)). A copy of the defense supplemental leter is atached as Exhibit B. For instance, a principal\ndefense concern at the Final Pretrial Conference concerned a lack of certainty about the “methods\nthat [Flatley’s] used” to extract data and uncertainty about “exactly what documents Mr. Flatley\nintends to refer to.” (Ud. at 2l, 23). The Government’s November 26 leter identifies the specific\nmethods Flatley used and the specific exhibits about which he will testify. The defendant’s\nNovember 27 leter identifies neither any methods nor any specific exhibits. The defendant’s\nexpert notice should at a minimum be held to the same standard as the Government. But there are\ncertainly no grounds for the defendant to challenge the sufficiency of the Government’s detailed\nexpert notice.\n\nIV.

In determining whether a party may impeach a\ntestifying witness through extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement, the Court must\nconsider the follouing five factors:\n\nFirst, whether the proffered statement in fact is inconsistent with the testimony sought to\nbe impeached, i.e., whether there is any variance between the statement and the testimony that has\na reasonable bearing on credibility. United States v. Ghailani, 76l F. Supp. 2d ll4, ll7-l8\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (internal citations and quotation marks omited).

The statement is overly prejudicial especially when viewed in the context\nof the other evidence that the government claims it will produce at trial, l.e., direct statements\nfrom accusers that Ms. Maxwell recruited them. This post-hoc statement atributed to Epstein by\na cooperating witness (l7 years later) will be used by the government to argue that Epstein\nadmited that Ms. Maxwell was a co-conspirator.

And Jane does not authorize\nMr. Glassman to testify about any of his alleged communications with her.\n\nFurther, as a California atorney, Mr. Glassman is bound by California Rule of\nProfessional Conduct l.6.

Rule l.6 prohibits an\natorney from disclosing confidential information of the client except in two extremely narrou\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.

Here, to the extent the\n“ther” in Ms. Moe’s email refers to Jane, Jane gives no such informed consent. And Mr.\nGlassman obviously has no reason to believe that disclosing any alleged communication he gave\nminimum, distasteful and designed to intimidate the witness, and should be discouraged. But\nprocedurally, the appearance date on the subpoena is November 29, 2o2l - two days before he\nwas served - making it impossible for him to comply.

Other Program Information\n\nl. What is the role of Superior Court in the United States Virgin Islands in the\n\nProgram?\nThe Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Probate Division) (“Probate\nCourt”) is the court where the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is being probated.

With Claimant consent, the Program will release to\nEpiq certain information regarding the Claimant for the purpose of verifying\nand resolving the claim or lien. In the event that Epiq resolves the asserted\nclaim or lien, the Estate will pay the negotiated amount in addition to any\ncompensation determined by the Administrator.\n\nl5|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l7 of l7\nThe Claimant is solely responsible to satisfy any and all other valid liens\n(other than Medicare and Medicaid liens referenced above) that have been\nasserted and/or may be asserted for reimbursement of any medical benefits\nprovided to the Claimant by a third party as a result of the injuries claimed.\n4.

Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused\n3 was also groomed?\n\n4 A. Sure. Yeah.

So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would\n2o be called kind of the victim literature.\n2l But then there are also a number of professionals who\n22 do research and work with the offenders.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n8 training, what factors, if any, place a child at increased risk\n9 of being sexually abused?\n\nlo A. The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they\nl2 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the child's\n\nl3 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to\nl4 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues\n\nl5 pertaining to the family.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have experienced victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child\n23 sexual abuse. We knou that children who come from\n24 disadvantaged <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> can be at higher risk, children\n25 with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, for example;\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool234o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 56 of 228 732\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl children who come from -- who are members of minority gender or\n2 sexual groups are also at higher risk.\n\n3 Q. You also mentioned parental factors. Can you explain that\n4 for the jury please.\n\n5 A. To the extent that there's conflict and particularly, to\n\n6 the extent that there's violence between the parents in the\n\n7 home, certainly to the extent that there are financial\n\n8 difficulties within the home, so children, families, parents\n\n9 who have less -- fewer resources, are at higher risk.\n\nlo To the extent that the parents themselves have\n\nll experienced any form of abuse in their oun backgrounds, that\n\nl2 also places the child at higher risk. To the extent that the\nl3 parents are abusive to the child, that puts the child at risk\nl4 for being abused by others. And there's also research to shou\nl5 that the presence of a stepfather in the home or oftentimes a\nl6 single parent can, under certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, put a child at\nl7 higher risk.\n\nl8 Q. You also mentioned family factors. Can you explain those\nl9 please.\n2o A. Those factors refer to the family functioning in general.\n2l So children who have poor atachment, poor connection with\n22 other family members are at higher risk. Families where there\n23 are other children in the home who are being abused or have\n24 been abused are at higher risk.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.)

What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic disclosure in unique <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. /n re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id.

Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

The government’s Memorandum\n(Dkt. 796) cloaks itself in Jn re Craig, but that case emphasized that disclosure\nrequires the most careful judgment and that “the public's curiosity in a defendant’s\nsecret conduct at a grand jury hearing cannot eclipse the right the defendant has to\nsecrecy and overwhelm his objection to public discourse.” l3l F.3d 99, lo5 (2d Cir.\nl997).\n\nBecause this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.\n\nTl.

In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol-o2\n(quoting In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir.l973)). This tradition of secrecy is\ncodified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page 23 of 27\nile 3 Seo LLP (Ty 2l2.5lo.7o3l\nSCHWARTZ 675 Third Avenue, 26th Floor (F) 242.5lo.7299\nten Ge ecie es e laiennle New York, INY lo6l7 ubindex(ajbinderschwartz com\nCONFIDENTIAL — SUBMITTED UNDER SEAL\nAugust 5, 2o25\nHon.

The\nSecond Circuit developed this doctrine in three cases where disclosure was sought of grand jury\nmaters claimed to be of unusual historical or public interest.

It today is recognized in the Second and Seventh Circuits, but not elsewhere.!”\n\nThe Second Circuit has set out a “non-exhaustive list of [nine] factors that a trial court\nmight want to consider when confronted with these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive\n‘special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>’ motions.” /d. at lo6. These are:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure;\n\n(i) whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\n\nthe disclosure;\n\n(i) why disclosure is being sought in the particular case;\n\n(iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n\nMost Circuits to address the issue have held that the only justifications for disclosing grand\njury maters are those set out in Rule 6(e)(3). See, e.g., McKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 843,\n85o (D.C. Cir. 2ol9), cert. denied, l4o S. Ct. 597 (2o2o); In re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d\n48l, 488 (6th Cir. l99l); United States v.

The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize disclosure of grand jury materials based on their historical or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v. United States, 27 F.4th 84, 93-94 (lst Cir. 2o22).\nBefore the D.C. Circuit’s 2ol9 decision finding Rule 6(e) to supply the only bases for disclosure,\ndistrict courts in that Circuit had considered—and sometimes granted—petitions to disclose\ngrand jury materials of historical importance, citing the Second Circuit’s precedents recognizing\ntheir authority to permit such disclosures.

Discussion\n\nA. The Government’s Basis for Claiming “Special <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span>”\n\nNo Rule 6(e)(3) exception authorizes the disclosure the Government proposes here: of,\nsubject to redactions, all testimony and exhibits before the two grand juries that indicted\nGhislaine Maxwell. The Government’s motion to unseal does not contend otherwise. It does not\nargue that these materials would aid federal, state, military, tribal, or foreign law enforcement; or\nwould be relevant to national security officials, another grand jury, or another judicial\nproceeding. Nor does the Government (or Maxwell) argue that the materials could reveal a\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel5of3l\nground to dismiss the indictment against her. And any such motion to dismiss on this basis today\nwould very likely be futile, because Maxwell’s conviction at trial renders all but the most serious\nerrors in the grand jury proceedings harmless. See Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489\nU.S. 794, 799-8o2 (l989) (“Only a defect so fundamental that it causes the grand jury no longer\nto be a grand jury, or the indictment no longer to be an indictment, gives rise to the constitutional\nright not to be tried.”); United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 7o-73 (l986).\n\nThe Government instead invokes the “special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” doctrine, on the ground that\nthere is an “abundant public interest” in obtaining additional information about Epstein and\nMaxwell’s crimes, and the DOJ and FBI’s investigation into them. Gov’t Mem. at 4; see also id.\nat l. It states that “[a]tention given to the Epstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in\nthe wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum announcing the conclusions of the Government’s\nreview into the investigation,” id. at 5, and that release of the Maxwell grand jury materials is\nessential to the goal of “transparency to the American public,” which “is of the utmost\nimportance to this Administration,” Motion to Unseal at l. “Public officials, lawmakers, pundits,\nand ordinary citizens,” it states, “remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein\nmater.” /d. at 3. And the Maxwell grand jury materials, the Government represents, are\n“critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history,” and “[t]he time for the public to\nguess at what they contain should end.” Jd. at 3-4 (quoting Jn re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive,\nlo4 F. Supp. 3d 625, 629 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5)).\n\n‘3 A district court in the Southern District of Florida recently denied the Government’s motion to\nunseal grand jury materials relating to the Government’s investigation of Epstein in that district,\nfinding that no Rule 6(e) exception applied. See Order Den. Pet. to Unseal Grand Jury Trs., Jn re\nGrand Jury 5-o2 (WPB) & 7-lo3 (WPB), 25 Misc. 8o92o (S.D. Fla.

Specifically, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to submit the grand jury transcripts and exhibits for in camera review, with the\nportions the Government proposed to redact highlighted. And it ordered the Government to file\na submission identifying the portions of the transcripts and exhibits, if any, that are not today\nmaters of public record, including based on Maxwell’s month-long jury trial on the charges\nreturned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government’s submissions in response to the Court’s orders were telling. They\nbelied the Government’s claim, in its motion to unseal, that the Maxwell grand jury materials\ncontain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the\ninvestigation into them. Two features of these materials, which were not disclosed in the\nGovernment’s motion, are noteworthy. The Court reports these here, at a level of generality that\ndoes not disclose the substance of grand jury proceedings.\n\nFirst, the grand juries in this case were not used for investigative purposes. They did not\nhear testimony from any firsthand witness to any event at issue. They did not hear testimony\nfrom any victim, eyewitness, suspect, or even a records custodian. The grand juries met instead\nfor the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel9 of 3l\nThey do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources\nof their wealth. They do not explore the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of Epstein’s death. They do not reveal\nthe path of the Government’s investigation.\n\nInsofar as the motion to unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine\nlode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they definitively are\nnot that. A “public official,” “lawmaker,” “pundit,” or “ordinary citizen” “deeply interested and\nconcerned about the Epstein mater,” Motion to Unseal at 3, and who reviewed these materials\nexpecting, based on the Government’s representations, to learn new information about Epstein’s\nand Maxwell’s crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed\nand misled. There is no “there” there.\n\nThis case is thus a far cry from every reported case applying the Second Circuit’s\n“special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” doctrine. In each such case, the petition to unseal, whether granted or\ndenied, sought unique, undisclosed information. That information generally consisted of\nfirsthand testimony from a public figure or a witness to an important event.

Supp. 274, 278, 297-98 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (“dn re AHA”’’) (granting in part and denying in\npart petition to unseal transcripts of l947—l95o grand jury testimony regarding alleged espionage\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2o of 3l\nby State Department official Alger Hiss); see also note l2, supra (citing similar D.D.C. cases).\nNone of these cases involved the secondhand, summary-witness testimony of law enforcement\nagents. None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\nAmendment. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2l of 3l\nredactions. /d. at 492-93. And once Biaggi’s testimony had been released, the Circuit\nelaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi\nhad misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand\njury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer l7 questions. /d. at 494. In these “special\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi’s false account. /d.\n\nThis Court gave careful consideration to unsealing the Maxwell grand jury materials on a\nsimilar rationale. But with the Government having nou conceded that the information it\nproposes to release is redundant of the public record—that this information was “made publicly\navailable at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly reported”—the public interest in\ntesting the Government’s bona fides does not require the extraordinary step of unsealing grand\njury records. Dkt. 8oo at 3. Without any need to review the grand jury materials, the public can\nevaluate for itself the Government’s asserted bases for making this motion.\n\nThe Court therefore denies the Government’s motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary\nto the Government’s depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a mater of significant\nhistorical or public interest. Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two\nlaw enforcement agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a mater of\nlongstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the\n2o2l Maxwell trial.\n\nB. Application of the In re Craig Factors\n\nIn cases involving grand jury testimony of significant historical or public interest, /n re\nCraig supplies a framework for evaluating whether disclosure, on balance, is warranted. It\nidentifies non-exclusive factors that may weigh against disclosure, including the interests of the\ndefendant and witnesses. Because the secondhand testimony at issue here is redundant of the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 22 of 3l\npublic-record trial testimony of firsthand witnesses, and thus is not of significant historical or\npublic interest, there is arguably no charter for even undertaking the Jn re Craig inquiry. After\nall, the “special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” exception to Rule 6(e) only applies in “exceptional\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,” not to “garden variety” grand jury testimony. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3\n(citation omited); see also Gov’t Mem. at 3-4 (“acknouledg[ing] the extraordinary nature of\n[its] request”).\n\nNonetheless, for completeness, the Court evaluates the Government’s motion in light of\nthe non-exhaustive factors listed in Jn re Craig. The Court also addresses two other factors\nimplicated by the motion: the perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, as expressed in\nleters to the Court; and the systemic interest in grand jury secrecy.\n\nAs this assessment shous, the Government has failed, by a wide margin, to carry its\nburden. These factors, considered together, favor denial of its motion to unseal.\n\nl. Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThis factor ordinarily carries “great weight,” and “the government’s position should be\npaid considerable heed.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But the Government’s position is “not\ndispositive.” Jd. “(Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can government\nopposition preclude it.” /d. And courts in this District, applying the Jn re Craig factors, have\nruled against the Government’s position. See In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d\nat 628-29 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony of two witnesses\nbefore grand jury that indicted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage); Jn re AHA, 49 F.\nSupp. 2d at 278, 297-98 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony before\ngrand juries that investigated and/or indicted Alger Hiss for espionage).\n\nThis factor favors disclosure. But for two reasons, the Court accords this factor limited\nweight.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 23 of 3l\n\nFirst, as the Second Circuit has explained, the Government’s position is mainly relevant\nbecause it reflects whether there is an ongoing need for grand jury secrecy. See In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6 (where “the government supports a motion for disclosure, that should serve as a\npreliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong”). But the central\ninfirmity of this motion to unseal does not concern an ongoing need for secrecy in this case. The\ninfirmity is that, as the Government has conceded, the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\nreveal information outside the public domain.\n\nSecond, any argument that the Government’s motion to unseal merits substantial\ndeference is weakened by a host of irregularities with respect to that motion. That motion was\nnot made, nor has it been joined in, by any member of the Government’s trial team—the DOJ\nlawyers presumably most familiar with the Maxwell case and the broader Epstein-Maxwell\ninvestigation. The motion was filed by the DAG alone, without any signatory from the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office in this District. And it was made under <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> suggestive of haste\nrather than reflective deliberation. The motion was three-and-a-half pages in length; there were\nno supporting materials filed, under seal or otherwise; the motion did not disclose (or reflect\nawareness of) the summary-witness nature of the Maxwell grand jury testimony; and the motion\nwas made without advance notice to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, a fact which, as reviewed\nbelou, has alarmed numerous victims. Only after the Court inquired on that point was notice to\nvictims given. See Dkt. 789; Dkt. 796 at 9. Finally, the Government’s highlighting of the grand\njury transcripts did not suggest close familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, because a number\nof details that it identified as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial. See note l6,\nsupra,\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 25 of 3l\ntestimony of mayoral candidate exposing as false his representation to the public that he had\nanswered all questions before grand jury). And the Government’s stated rationale for its motion\nbears no resemblance to any “grounds that justify disclosure under the existing exceptions listed\nin Rule 6(e).” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nIn arguing that this factor favors disclosure, the Government makes broad proclamations\nabout the public’s interest in learning more about the Epstein-Maxwell investigation. See Gov’t\nMem. at 5 (“Many questions remain unanswered, and the public’s interest remains.” (quoting Jn\nre AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 294)). That interest is undeniable. But the Government has failed to\nconnect it to the materials at issue, which would not answer any of the public’s questions.\n\nThis factor decisively weighs against unsealing.\n\n4, What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\n“The specificity of the data sought is significant in at least two ways.” In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6.\n\nFirst, there are obvious differences between releasing one witness’[s] testimony,\n\nthe full transcript, or merely the minutes of the proceeding. And, second, it is highly\n\nrelevant whether the disclosure is general or limited to a specified number of people\n\nunder special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nId. at lo6—lo7 (citation omited).\n\nHere, the Government does not seek tailored disclosure of discrete items within a grand\njury record. Nor does it seek leave to disseminate grand jury materials to a specified audience.\nIt seeks disclosure to the public at large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury,\nsubject only to redactions aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nThis factor weighs against unsealing. The Government has identified no information of\nconsequence within the grand jury record that is not already public. And, under Jn re Craig, the\nblanket quality of the motion to unseal weighs against unsealing.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 26 of 3l\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe Second Circuit has instructed:\n\nThe timing of the request remains one of the most crucial elements. Time maters\n\nin several ways. First, if historical interest in a specific case has persisted over a\n\nnumber of years, that serves as an important indication that the public’s interest in\n\nrelease of the information is substantial. (Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops\n\nNorthwest, 44l U.S. 22l, 222 (l979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy\n\nare reduced after the grand jury has ended its activities). Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was convicted spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her conviction remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 626\n(l95o testimony); Jn re AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (l947-l95o testimony); see also note l2,\nsupra (citing similar D.D.C. cases). But see In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492-93 (testimony less\nthan two years earlier).\n\n'’ The Circuit, in illustrating earlier in its opinion why historical or public interest considerations\ncould justify the release of grand jury information, stated: “To the extent that the John Wilkes\nBooth or Aaron Burr conspiracies, for example, led to grand jury investigations, historical\ninterest might by nou overwhelm any continued need for secrecy.” /d. at lo5.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 3o of 3l\n\nThat admonition requires courts applying the Second Circuit’s “special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>”\nexception to grand jury secrecy to invoke it only in rare, “exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,” mindful of\nthe precedent that unsealing would set. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3. The exception, after all,\nderives from a district court’s supervisory authority over grand juries, id. at lo2 & n.2, which\ncarries with it the duty to safeguard “the traditional functioning of the institution,” United States\nv. Williams, 5o4 U.S. 36, 5l (l992). Applying the exception casually or promiscuously, as the\nGovernment’s motion to unseal the summary-witness grand jury testimony here invites, would\nrisk “unravel[ing] the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised,” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo3, and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before “future grand\njuries,” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 222, that the general rule of secrecy still holds.\n\nThis factor weighs heavily against unsealing. Granting the Government’s motion would\nbloat the “special <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” doctrine, which to date has warranted disclosure in only a tiny\nnumber of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious\npublic or historical moment. And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials,\nbecause they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous. The same\ncould be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in\nsupport of charges that later proceeded to trial.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2o of lo6 24\nLBTVMAXl\n\nl evidence admited at trial.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n8 training, what factors, if any, place a child at increased risk\n9 of being sexually abused?\n\nlo A. The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they\nl2 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the child's\n\nl3 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to\nl4 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues\n\nl5 pertaining to the family.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have experienced victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child\n23 sexual abuse. We knou that children who come from\n24 disadvantaged <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> can be at higher risk, children\n25 with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, for example;\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7928\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 56 of 228 732\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl children who come from -- who are members of minority gender or\n2 sexual groups are also at higher risk.\n\n3 Q. You also mentioned parental factors. Can you explain that\n4 for the jury please.\n\n5 A. To the extent that there's conflict and particularly, to\n\n6 the extent that there's violence between the parents in the\n\n7 home, certainly to the extent that there are financial\n\n8 difficulties within the home, so children, families, parents\n\n9 who have less -- fewer resources, are at higher risk.\n\nlo To the extent that the parents themselves have\n\nll experienced any form of abuse in their oun backgrounds, that\n\nl2 also places the child at higher risk. To the extent that the\nl3 parents are abusive to the child, that puts the child at risk\nl4 for being abused by others. And there's also research to shou\nl5 that the presence of a stepfather in the home or oftentimes a\nl6 single parent can, under certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, put a child at\nl7 higher risk.\n\nl8 Q. You also mentioned family factors. Can you explain those\nl9 please.\n2o A. Those factors refer to the family functioning in general.\n2l So children who have poor atachment, poor connection with\n22 other family members are at higher risk. Families where there\n23 are other children in the home who are being abused or have\n24 been abused are at higher risk.

Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that\nMaxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the leter from defendant\nMaxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the\none previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion\nto dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. l6, 2o2o\nConf. at 3:22—24. Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that\ndispositive motions do not stay discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s\nindividual rules. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—l2; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule HI.C.2.\n(“Absent extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the Court does not stay discovery or any other case\nmanagement deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”). Maxwell’s anticipated\nmotion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this mater, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss\nhave not stayed discovery in any other mater against it in this District.\n\nThe Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her\nanticipated motion to stay discovery in this mater in its entirety. Nor is full briefing necessary to\naddress the above issues—the anticipated motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this\nCourt’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice\nto Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell has already failed to comply with\nher discovery obligations in this mater, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for\na full, three-week briefing schedule on her anticipated motion to stay will only give her another\nincentive to continue to delay.

Trustees\nof Plumbers and Pipefiters Nat. Pension Fund, 886 F. Supp. at ll4l. This Court is persuaded\nthat, as Maxwell is a central figure in this civil case, a stay of discovery that applies only to her\nwould prejudice the Co-Executors by requiring them to conduct discovery without having the\nopportunity to depose Maxwell or collect documents in her possession. (See 8/27/2o Moskouitz\nLtr., at l-2.) Further, a partial stay could lead to duplicative depositions, as, once the partial stay\nis lifted, Maxwell would be entitled to question any witnesses (including Plaintiff) who may\nhave already been deposed during the pendency of the partial stay, and, once evidence is\nobtained from Maxwell, other parties might also wish to re-depose witnesses. (See id. at 2.)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s motion for a stay of this action, in its entirety,\npending the completion of the criminal prosecution against her (Dkt. 69) is granted. If, houever,\nthe underlying <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> change over time in a way that could affect this Court’s balancing\nof the relevant factors, then the parties may bring the changed <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> to this Court’s\natention, and it will then consider whether the stay should continue or be lifted.

Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nApp.o6o\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019578.jpg": "Came PAGO OOBBoANeht DOCORBAIADL o Fed DS7o8/28g9 ch aged HS\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These suggestions are\ndisingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented. Finally, there is no other case that\ndefense counsel has located where [a\nee\nee\nCSC‘\nee\nThat Ms. Maxwell did not knou what was in the sealed materials before she signed the\nProtective Order, or proposed a draft, is self-evident. That a Court can modify a protective order\nat any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim.

The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019868.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN IOSdtuUM Ent /2o FilesOOAH2o2 P ahageb26ioLo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span> of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9868\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019872.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DacOMENl 2o 2Fil Go OF ZOH/ 26a Gedgecd 26o.o\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019881.jpg": "Cast F-26-C2oDSSOASN Bocturhert l8 Heo PA Ooo Pager of 26o\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool988l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019882.jpg": "Cast F-26-C2oDSSOASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPA Ooo Pagee of 26o\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019883.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/bo Pages of 26o\ninnocence.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\nb\nDOJ-OGR-oool9883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019886.jpg": "CaGese2hlcrdaseuAUAN Scene l &Pitdd BHPPHMS Pages 2 St 2EP\n\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v. Chandler, l9-CR-867\n(PAC), 2o2o WL l528l2o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019888.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDISSCUAUN Distant &Pitdd BPFH Pager S2o\n\nThe government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 transaction under a fake name and not be detected. So there\n\n5 really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie\n6 about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the\n7 means to do so.

Of\nl3 course, as we noted in our reply brief, it is very important to\nl4 the government that the victims receive justice in this case\nl5 and that there be a trial so that that could happen. That is\nl6 very important to the government, and we respectfully submit\nl7 that the court should take that into account. Houever, again,\nl8 the victims' participation in this proceeding is pursuant to\nl9 their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act. It is not\n2o part of the government's presentation in this case.\n\n2l THE COURT: Okay.

And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight. The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes. The\n23 government also proffers that this witness testimony will be\n24 corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary\n25 evidence.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82).

(Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020069.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot ep C33ouAUNIt Bescutrentl loo2 lF iG 422o8/2 o9g Pagel I ob 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020071.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEciuMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FgPagetlisef 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and <span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span> of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020082.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel 26st 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F.

B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 93).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9).

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020125.jpg": "Casmt2o4c68oRB8o.4obht Docume WAS , PIEASIBW/2Baoe6bayel B.pf 4\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be\nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.\n\n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell’ require\nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be\noppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in\nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under\nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights\nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in\nthe Opinion’.\n\n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly\nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to\ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.\n\n4. Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2oo3 (‘the 2oo3 Act’)\nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is\nsent to her by the extradition judge’. The ambit of the pouer in section 93 is\ndescribed at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse\nextradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable\nbar to extradition® is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the\nrequest has been withdrawn’; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from\n\n> Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition.\n* Opinion, paras. 27-29 and 36-37.\n° As appears to be submited by the Government at p.l9 of the Memorandum.\n° The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality\n(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the\nUnited Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A).\n’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 93(4)(a).\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020130.jpg": "CaGade2o ep) o36Go4AUt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2eg Pagef 3 Gb 22\nDefendant did not appeal the Court’s determination that detention was required, and she has been\nincarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nII. Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v.

See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”’); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020135.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAuNit Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9o Fagef d Ob 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020136.jpg": "CaGade2o epQ)o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget J Gb 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020139.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pag efL Dos 22\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding\nindictment dated 7 July 2o2o.”); Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL\nl456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9\n(N.D.N.Y. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d l29, l32 33 (D.D.C. 2oo4); United\nStates v. Chen, 82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2l2 (N.D. Cal. l992). In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\ndetermination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d\n3o6, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (describing the “Defense proposal to give advance consent to\nextradition and waiver of extradition rights” as “an empty gesture.”); United States v. Morrison,\nNo. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020198.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas22F2I9 ePagei7 l6l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020209.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesuteAtl BO l FROG O22o6/2agAagect H6l6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nNo. l7-CR-o2949-MV-l\n\nv.\n\nDASHAWN ROBERTSON,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nTHIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to\nReconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release.

Jd. The Court also found that Mr. Robertson’s release was\nnecessary to allou him to effectively prepare for his upcoming trial under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(4)\nbecause the ongoing COVID-l9 pandemic has significantly hampered his ability to meet or\ncommunicate with his atorneys. /d.

With regard to the\nnature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting.

Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the\nstatutory presumption of detention, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it\nbecomes a factor to be weighed and considered in deciding whether release is\nwarranted. /d.\n\n3o. Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense charged”; (2)\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n3l. This Court generally applies “deferential review to a district\ncourt’s order of detention.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir.\n2ol9).

Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020254.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020256.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page22 of 25\nMaxwell’s access to counsel, and Maxwell did not renew her request for temporary\nrelease in her third bail motion.’\n\n39. Under these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that temporary release is not “necessary” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F.

Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of the offense charged”; (2)\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020373.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel5 of 24\nabuse of discretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions.

Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted\nin part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to\ncertain questions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to\nensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No.\n255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over\ncopies of video tapes of the in-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video\ntapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels preservation leter. Dkt. No. 248,\nEx. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to view or receive copies of\nthose materials as a mater of law, they should be provided. To the extent defense\ncounsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that application is\ndenied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the\nopportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates\nin BOP custody.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

On January l2, 2o23, I filed a motion to extend time to file Appellant’s brief\nfrom January 3o, 2o23, to February 28, 2o23, to which Appellee United States Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York had no objection.\n5 On January l6, 2o23, the motion to extend time was still pending.\n| 6. Because a motion to file an oversized brief must be made no less than l4 days\nbefore the brief is due (Local Rule 27.l(e)3), pursuant to Local Rule 27.l(e)(2), I filed a\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o6l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020649.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page3l of 2o8\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\n\no3/24/2o2l l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers categorically deny\nthe allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff based on the incident\nand the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no views as to whether some\nother action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either sides allegations. This\nCourts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an\nopportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-client\ncommunications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to\ntake further action at this time. After recetving the defenses first leter motion, the Court\nordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why the Court should not grant the requested\nrelief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in part defense counsels original request and\nordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain questions about the April 24, 2o2l\nincident and the procedures in place to ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells\nlawyer-client communications.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that. . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020777.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel59 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o777\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020781.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel63 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d.\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\nye.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020790.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel72 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 34\nhas commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to\nallou Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020833.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page? of 22l\n3l26\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl mind of their oun.

Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020955.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel29 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l2 of 4o\nwilling to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l7\n(l982). One important means of ensuring an impartial jury is voir dire examination, which\n“expos[es] possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the part of potential jurors,” by\neliciting information under oath. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548,\n554 (l984).\n\nOnce a jury has returned a verdict, a motion to set aside that verdict is “disfavored” and\nthe moving party must overcome an “exacting hurdle” of proof. United States v. Ventura, No.\no9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4); see United States v.\nlanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989). And while Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33\npermits a court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so\nrequires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), the Second Circuit has cautioned district courts that “such\naction must be done ‘sparingly’ and in ‘the most extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” United States v.\nArcher, 977 F.3d l8l, l87 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v.

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F.

Juror 5o explained hou the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial.

First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be\nimplied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial. The Defendant’s\nonly in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas. See Maxwell Br. at 3o-35;\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5. In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias\n“when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being\nlitigated.”” 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l64\n(D. Mass. 2oll)). But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias\nbecause that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed\nabove) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and\ncreation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.\n\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrou category.\nThe circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions\nthat jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which\nmight bear directly or indirectly on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of a given case, where . . . there is no\nshouing of actual bias or prejudice.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Broun,\n644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d\nCir. l99l). As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ntrial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that\nwere similar to conduct charged in the case. l28 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]uch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020976.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” /d. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l.

No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n4 The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same.

Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021185.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye ae 3536o38, Pagel3 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nix\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021233.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ae ye ae 3536o38, Page6l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense.

During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than. . . everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\n\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can rightly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age’—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”*”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he ‘“wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n52 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021238.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N64 3536o38, Page66 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”©? Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome .. . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n2 Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section I.B.l.\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021242.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page/o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\n\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n4 Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\na The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021249.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged. ”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.”” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”°°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillatfafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n4a From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021321.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NAT 3536o38, Pagel49 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021322.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l48 3536o38, Pagel5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.'** The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nlS As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl4 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021325.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TST 3536o38, Pagel53 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM §§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021326.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ED 3536o38, Pagel54 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !°°\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nlS The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021327.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l53 3536o38, Pagel55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist. Accordingly, absent such\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021330.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel58 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l56 of 348\nis subject to all rules of the court.!”? Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC).

FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021338.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON G4 3536o38, Pagel66 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Circumstances</span>,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021348.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel76 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.**? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021357.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l83 3536o38, Pagel85 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 348\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings .. . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting. . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021360.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARG 3536o38, Pagel88 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l86 of 348\n2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “‘a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.”*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\noo Julie K.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\noth Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\nams Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021374.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3oo | 3536o38, Page2o2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would of require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”°>\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021395.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o38, Page223 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.?”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 356. 3536o38, Page228 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice.

She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 - SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters.

Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021414.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34o 3536o38, Page242 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021443.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 567 3536o39, Pagel3 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo -— 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”?”?

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*””\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021479.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o3 3536o39, Page49 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”*3’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.”*78 The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.**° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\n437 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n438 See R.

Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound.

When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.

Discussion\n\nJudge Nathan conducted a thorough inquiry and\ndetermined that Juror 5o’s inadvertent errors on the\njury questionnaire did not undermine Maxwell’s right\nto a fair trial. Maxwell does not meaningfully engage\nwith Judge Nathan’s careful opinion, instead suggest-\ning that Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing was “pa-\ntently absurd.” (Br.63).

She explained that his answers were\n“logical explanations and generally internally con-\nsistent,” given in a “calm and straightforward man-\nner.” (/d.). Juror 5o’s explanations were consistent\nwith “his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir\ndire” and his testimony that “his sexual abuse history\nwas not salient or [a] front-of mind consideration.”\n(Id.).

(Br.67). That falls far short of re-\nquiring the District Court to imply bias. First, as\nJudge Nathan explained, the law is not that “bias must\nbe implied when a juror has a personal experience sim-\nilar to the issues at trial.” (A.349). Rather, this Court\nhas “consistently refused to create a set of unreasona-\nbly constricting presumptions that jurors be excused\nfor cause due to certain occupational or other special\nrelationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> of a given case.” (A.349 (quoting\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46)). This case is not within one of\nthe rare, extreme <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where a mandatory\npresumption of bias applies. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d\nat 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Second, although there\nare some similarities between Juror 5o’s childhood\nsexual abuse, there are also differences: Juror 5o was\nyounger than the trial victims at the time of their\nabuse, he was abused by a family member, and he dis-\nclosed his abuse much earlier.

As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin.

As the bureau, which oversees\nl22 federal prisons and more than l7o,ooo inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>\nthat led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer.\n“\\We have put such huge strains on the Burean of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission,\" Hawk Sawyer said before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, “With\nthe dramatic grouth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages, it’s just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last l6\nyears that I've been gone.” The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched,\" she added.\nHawk Sawyer atributed the resouree problem to the rapid increase in the prison population in the last 3o years, employees retiring at a faster rate than they\n. are hired, uncertain budgets, ihe recent government shutdoun andthe hiring [freeze early in the Trump administration. \"We have never had adequate\n__ Pesources to provide all the programs for all the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change nou since you all support the First Step Act.”\nAccording to the hurean's website it currently has 96,348 staff members. The New York Times reported:\nBetween December 2ol6 and September 2ol8 — the date of the most recent data available from the federal Office of Personnel Management — the number of\ncorrectional officers fell more than ll%, from l9,o82 to l6,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend. Before President Doneld Trump tock office, the\nnumber of federal correctional officers had continuously increased: there were l2.5% more officers at the end of 2ol6 compared to the beginning of 2ol2.\nHawk Sawyer said the bureau has “made great progress\" to fill the over 3,3oo vacancies nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff,\nthe bureau is working with the Office of Personnel Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a temporary basis because they are already\n- \" trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online.\nSawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources.

Thomas seeks materials\nthat are not in the possession of the United States Atorney’s Office or the case teams at the FBI\nand DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation.\n\nThomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the\nprosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic\ndecisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the\nMCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and writen\nrequests to the MCC’s legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any\ninternal BOP investigation into the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding Epstein’s suicide. Notwithstanding\nthose facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is “allied with the prosecution” and therefore the\nGovernment’s discovery and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the\npossession of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is setled law in this\nCircuit that a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or\ncontrol of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a “joint\ninvestigation” with that agency. None of the indicia of a “joint” or “allied” prosecution, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors\nconsidered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did\nnot participate in the prosecution’s witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case\nto the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022093.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 3l of 34\nintent”); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same). “[T]he shouing necessary to obtain discovery should itself\nbe a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 464.\n“Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient” to meet this\nburden.

He has not carried his burden through a shouing of any\nevidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.\n\nAs to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any\nevidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of\nconduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].” Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal\nquotation marks omited). “A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who\nhas commited roughly the same crime under roughly the same <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> but against whom\nthe law has not been enforced.” United States v. Lewis, 5l7 F.3d 2o, 27 (lst Cir. 2oo8). Thomas\nalleges that there was an “almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6 wherein officers failed to\nconduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide,” and one of the four\nofficers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to\nconduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts.

United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 468 (l996). “[A] defendant\nwho seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must shou some evidence of both\ndiscriminatory effect and discriminatory intent.” United States v.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”**! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 9 G.2, available at htps://“www justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\nBL See 2oll Guidelines, Art.

Failure to Assign Epstein a New Cellmate on August 9\nl. Day Watch Staff Actions on August 9\nThe SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that he worked at MCC New York on August 8, 2ol9, from approximately\n6 a.m. until approximately 2 p.m., and that he was off on August 9, 2ol9. The SHU Lieutenant, whose shift\nended over an hour before the USMS sent the second email regarding Inmate 3's impending transfer, told\nthe OIG he was not aware that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred out of MCC New York, and\ntherefore he did not notify the Captain that Epstein would require a new cellmate. According to the SHU\nLieutenant, as soon as the SHU staff learned that Inmate 3 would be transferred, they should have notified a\nLieutenant on duty. The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the\nOIG that on August 9, 2ol9, they had oversight of the SHU from approximately 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. due to\ntheir position descriptions and because of the SHU Lieutenant’s absence.\nAccording to the MCC New York Staff Roster, on August 9, 2ol9, SHU Officer #l was listed as Senior Officer\nSpecialist 5. Although SHU Officer #l is typically the Officer in Charge, another Senior Officer Specialist told\nthe OIG that, in actuality, he was the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 from approximately\n6 a.m. until 2 p.m. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that since he had the most experience and\nseniority, he was considered by everyone to be the SHU Officer in Charge, which the SHU Lieutenant\nconfirmed. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a\ncellmate. He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or\npsychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant\nhad instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge, between July 3o and August 9, 2ol9, he told all other MCC New York staff members\nwho worked in the SHU of Epstein’s cell mate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in\nthe SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knouledge, training,\nand experience.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, the SHU staff\nreceived an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as “WAB,” which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was\nbeing removed from MCC New York. He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted\nEpstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time\nEpstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were\naccompanied by CO l, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge and CO l both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his\nbelongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that\nhe would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a\ncellmate. In his interview with the OIG, CO l confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications\nmade either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the\nOIG that when he and CO l left the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants’\nOffice and should have seen that Inmate 3 was departing the institution when they passed the office.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York,\nthere had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal,\nonly to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>.

The fact that these failures have\nbeen recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and\nrelated problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DOJ personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate. The failure to make these required\nnotifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further belou—\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023474.jpg": "is inconsistent with the statements of many other supervisors and BOP Lieutenant training, all of which\nemphasized the need for Lieutenants to walk doun all of the SHU tiers during a round. During their\ninterviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden l, and the Captain\nclarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk\ndoun each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC. MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span>, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line. The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that\nEpstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System.

Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\npersonnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined\nMCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not\nuncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with Epstein’s death.\n\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only\nbecause the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to\nquestions about the <span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous\nvictims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures\nhave been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional\ninstitutions. The BOP agreed with all recommendations.\nReport: Today's report and an interactive timeline of events can be found on the OIG's website at the\nfollouing link: htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/investigation-and-review-federal-bureau-prisons-custody-care-\nand-supervision-jeffrey\nVideo: To accompany today’s report, the OIG has released a 3-minute video of the Inspector General\ndiscussing the report's findings.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023781.jpg": "Re: I/M Epstein # 763l8-o54\nFrom\nTo harisma EdgeJames Petrucci Mart\nLicon-VitaleShirley V.

The current indictment alleged\nsexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July l8, 2ol9,\nMr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.\n\nOn August 9, 2ol9, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,ooo pages of documents into the\npublic domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book\norder receipt for titles such as SM ol: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for\n\nErotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their\nOwners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The\ndocuments were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who\nalleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was\nMr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.\nAccording to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days\nalthough it is unknoun whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist\nand it is not knoun with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July l6, 2ol9, and\nthe other on August 9, 2ol9. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded.

This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.\n\n3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\nDs It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment,\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y.

This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.\n\n3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\n5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, :\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">circumstances</span> will only be subject to one deposition: “In any case, no person shall be\ndeposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued\non good cause shoun.”\n\n(3 This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal\ncase from potential emotional harm. State v. Ford, 626 So.2d l338 (Fla. l993); State v.\nTarrago, 8oo So.2d 3oo (Fla. 3d DCA 2ool). A requirement that a single deposition be\ntaken by Defendant Epstein for both the civil and criminal cases will avoid unnecessary\nemotional harm to Y. Doe.
