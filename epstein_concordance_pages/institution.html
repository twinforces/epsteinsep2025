First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> (“<span class=\"highlight\">Institution</span>-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from <span class=\"highlight\">Institution</span>-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000432.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 22 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page2of9\nHon.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans.

After\nreviewing the camera footage, the MDC concluded that the search was conducted appropriately\nand the defendant’s complaint about that incident was unfounded. MDC legal counsel further\nconfirmed that all pat-doun searches of the defendant are video recorded. Follouing this incident,\nMDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty.

STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002015.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 43 of 45\nalerted the government on August 27, 2o2o that there were significant portions of the first three\ndiscovery productions that Ms. Maxwell could not read.

In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense\nalerted the government to these problems, contained some of the same technical problems and\nincluded a significant number of unreadable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the\nsixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable discovery for over four months.'? Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the discovery.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine.

As reported by the associate warden to the Criminal Justice\nAdvisory Board on December 2, MDC does not mandate testing among its staff. A temperature\ncheck and response to a few questions does litle to detect an asymptomic carrier. The constant\nstrip searching, touch wanding, and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for\nexposure to COVID-l9.\n\n8 On November l8, 2o2o, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC,\nwhich it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive\ncontaining all of the discovery.

We note, houever, that nou that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has\naccess to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot\nbecause of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer.\n\n37\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-l5 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 8 of lo\n\n24.

As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2729", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 6 of 9\n\nof Ms. Maxwell’s London house and any other assets, excluding salary, hereinafter acquired.\nThe asset manager will approve the financial <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> at which the New Account is created and\nmust approve and co-sign any expenditure from the New Account, with the exception of\ndisbursements for Ms. Maxwell’s legal fees in connection with the ongoing criminal and civil\nlitigation and for payment of taxes, which will not require authorization.

As part of every pat-doun search, the defendant\nis required to remove her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked\nduring the searches, can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth.” These pat-doun\nand mouth searches are consistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they\nmove to a different location within the jail facility. In the absence of in-person visitation, the\ndefendant has not been strip searched. If the defendant receives in-person visits, then she, like all\nother inmates, will be strip searched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. At night,\nMDC staff are required to confirm every fifteen minutes that the defendant is not in distress. To\ndo so, every fifteen minutes, staff point a flashlight to the concrete ceiling of the defendant’s cell\nto illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing. At night, MDC staff\nhave observed that the defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance\ncaused by the flashlight. Additionally, MDC staff have observed that the defendant regularly\nsleeps through these nightime wellness checks. The MDC continues to be of the view that all of\nthese searches are necessary for the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and the defendant.\n\nThe Government also inquired regarding certain complaints defense counsel raised in\nFebruary 2o2l regarding the defendant’s food, water, and physical wellbeing. In response, MDC\n> Follouing defense counsel’s complaint in its February l6, 2o2l leter of an inappropriately\nconducted pat-doun search, the MDC conducted an investigation and found that, contrary to the\ndefendant’s claim, the search in question was in fact recorded in full by a handheld camera. After\nreviewing the camera footage, the MDC concluded that the search was conducted appropriately\nand the defendant’s complaint about that incident was unfounded. MDC legal counsel further\nconfirmed that all pat-doun searches of the defendant are video recorded. Follouing this incident,\nMDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty. Among other\nthings, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which\ncaused the cell to smell. In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing\nthe cell to become increasingly dirty. MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell in\nresponse to the smell and the dirtiness, not as retaliation for complaining about a particular search.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo29o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl96- Filed o4/o6/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nlegal counsel informed the Government that the defendant’s meals arrive in containers that are\nboth microuavable and oven safe. Currently, the defendant’s meals are heated in a thermal oven.\nThe tap water available in the MDC is provided by New York City. As a result, on occasions\nwhen the City has conducted maintenance near the MDC, the water has been temporarily shut off.\nDuring those periods, MDC staff have provided all inmates, including the defendant, with botled\nwater. After the water is turned back on, the water is sometimes cloudy or broun and needs to run\nfor several seconds before becoming clear. MDC staff have not observed any instance in which\nthe water in the defendant’s cell did not clear after being run for several seconds. MDC legal\ncounsel emphasized that MDC staff, including the legal staff, drink the same tap water from the\nsame water system as the defendant while in the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>.\n\nMDC medical staff monitor the defendant daily and weigh the defendant at least once per\nweek. During her time at the MDC, the defendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and\nthe l4os. The defendant’s louest observed weight was l33 pounds in July of 2o2l. Since then,\nher weight has fluctuated but has never been louer than l34 pounds. Most recently, when the\ndefendant was weighed last week, her weight was l37.5 pounds. The defendant is 5’ 7”, meaning\nthat even her louest weight of l33 pounds resulted in a BMI of 2o.8, which is considered a normal\nweight for a person of the defendant’s height. MDC staff have not observed the defendant\nexperience any noticeable hair loss. As noted above, the defendant has received a COVID-l9\nvaccine and is nou fully vaccinated.

At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages.

But\nthat decision does not justify the degree to which the MDC overmanages Ms. Maxwell’s\ndetention and its detrimental effect on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for trial.\n\nWe have repeatedly expressed our concern for Ms. Maxwell’s health and the impact her\nconditions of confinement are having on her health and well-being, her ability to prepare for\ntrial, and the overall impact the severe conditions will have on her stamina to withstand trial,\nwhich we moved to the fall.

This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages.

According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases.

Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher.

Because of her wealth, social status, and connections, she believes herself\nbeyond reproach and above the law. Sentencing her to the rest of her life in prison will not change\nher, but it will give other survivors and I a slight sense of justice and help us as we\n\ncontinue to work to recover from the sex-traticking hell she perpetrated. She will never,\never hurt another young woman or child in this lifetime. For that, I am sure.\n\nAs for the important, high-profile enablers — governmental institutions, politicians, and very\nwealthy friends of Epstein/Maxwell here and abroad — so far their stature and pouer have protected\nthem.

The Court has not considered them in resolving the motion to unseal.\n\nll. The Systemic Interest in Grand Jury Secrecy\n\nA final consideration is systemic. “[T]he proper functioning of our grand jury system\ndepends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 2l8. For\nthat reason, the Supreme Court has instructed louer courts “considering the effects of disclosure\non grand jury proceedings” to assess “the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand\njuries,” mindful that “[p]ersons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their\ntestimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties.” /d. at 222; see also Procter & Gamble\nCo., 356 U.S. at 682 (“The grand jury as a public <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> serving the community might suffer\nif those testifying today knew that the secrecy of their testimony would be lifted tomorrou.”);\nBaker v. U.S. Steel Corp., 492 F.2d lo74, lo76 n.2 (2d Cir. l974) (similar).\n\n'8 These include the Government’s decision, while pursuing release of the grand jury materials,\nto not publicly release further records from its investigation of Epstein and Maxwell, see, e.g.,\nDkt. 8o4 at 9 (noting “the much larger volume of information available in the ‘more than 3oo\ngigabytes of data and physical evidence’ in the Government’s possession that should be\ndisclosed as well”); its “suggestion that no further criminal investigations are forthcoming,” id.\nat 8; its not having given notice to victims before it filed the instant motion to unseal, id. at 8, l6,\n2l; its transfer of Maxwell to a louer security prison, which, a leter states, “has further eroded\nthe victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities,” id. at l5; the possibility that\nMaxwell might receive clemency, id. at l5—l6; and the DAG’s decision to meet with Maxwell\n“as though she were a credible authority,” which, one leter states, has publicly “legitimiz[ed]\nher,” id. at l5; see also id. at 2o.\n\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 3o of 3l\n\nThat admonition requires courts applying the Second Circuit’s “special circumstances”\nexception to grand jury secrecy to invoke it only in rare, “exceptional circumstances,” mindful of\nthe precedent that unsealing would set. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3. The exception, after all,\nderives from a district court’s supervisory authority over grand juries, id. at lo2 & n.2, which\ncarries with it the duty to safeguard “the traditional functioning of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>,” United States\nv. Williams, 5o4 U.S. 36, 5l (l992). Applying the exception casually or promiscuously, as the\nGovernment’s motion to unseal the summary-witness grand jury testimony here invites, would\nrisk “unravel[ing] the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised,” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo3, and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before “future grand\njuries,” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 222, that the general rule of secrecy still holds.\n\nThis factor weighs heavily against unsealing. Granting the Government’s motion would\nbloat the “special circumstances” doctrine, which to date has warranted disclosure in only a tiny\nnumber of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious\npublic or historical moment. And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials,\nbecause they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous.

(Dkt. 66). Despite numerous atempts\nto fix these problems over the succeeding weeks, including producing a replacement hard drive\ncontaining these productions, the problems were not resolved and the replacement hard drive was\nbroken. In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense\nalerted the government to these problems, contained some of the same technical problems and\nincluded a significant number of unreadable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the\nsixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable discovery for over four months.’ Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the discovery.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine. On\nNovember l8, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in l4-day quarantine due\nto contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving team of guards assigned to Ms.\nMaxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their oun COVID outbreaks,\nheightens her exposure to the virus. As reported by the associate warden to the Criminal Justice\nAdvisory Board on December 2, MDC does not mandate testing among its staff. A temperature\ncheck and response to a few questions does litle to detect an asymptomic carrier. The constant\nstrip searching, touch wanding, and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for\nexposure to COVID-l9.\n\n'3 On November l8, 2o2o, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC,\nwhich it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive\ncontaining all of the discovery. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\ntechnical problems. We note, houever, that nou that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has\naccess to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot\nbecause of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer.\n\n37\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo57", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020095.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGHANt DEctuMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tHgPageBStaf 36\nother inmates in protective custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>.

At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89).

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020271.jpg": "CaSade2Dl ebDOZBOuAGN Dibeumenviare lFited StiaRagPiaygef 2 of 2\nWe respectfully request that Your Honor vacate the order of January l5, 2o2l, and allou the\n<span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> to resume the prior schedule of laptop access, Monday through Friday, 7:oo AM — 8:oo PM.\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sophia Papapetru\nSophia Papapetru\nStaff Atorney\nMDC Brooklyn\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o27l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020275.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot epQO33ouAUNt Dieu tren2i5® lFiked §2lo5/2ig Pagel 2 af 2\nPage 2\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC.\n\nMDC staff conduct two pat-doun searches of the defendant per day: once when she is\nmoved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day\nroom to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. MDC staff\nalso conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.\nAt night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen\nminutes. To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the\ncell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes. The MDC\ncontinues to assess that these searches are all necessary for the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and the\ndefendant.\n\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\nthe Government will promptly provide additional information.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020279.jpg": "CaSede2ZotepQo33ouAUNt Diseutmen2lge@ lFiked §47o6/249 Pagel Lat 6\nPage 4\n\nshe returns to the day room from the scan area. As part of every pat-doun search, the defendant\nis required to remove her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked\nduring the searches, can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth.” These pat-doun\nand mouth searches are consistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they\nmove to a different location within the jail facility. In the absence of in-person visitation, the\ndefendant has not been strip searched. If the defendant receives in-person visits, then she, like all\nother inmates, will be strip searched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. At night,\nMDC staff are required to confirm every fifteen minutes that the defendant is not in distress. To\ndo so, every fifteen minutes, staff point a flashlight to the concrete ceiling of the defendant’s cell\nto illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing. At night, MDC staff\nhave observed that the defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance\ncaused by the flashlight. Additionally, MDC staff have observed that the defendant regularly\nsleeps through these nightime wellness checks. The MDC continues to be of the view that all of\nthese searches are necessary for the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and the defendant.\n\nThe Government also inquired regarding certain complaints defense counsel raised in\nFebruary 2o2l regarding the defendant’s food, water, and physical wellbeing. In response, MDC\n> Follouing defense counsel’s complaint in its February l6, 2o2l leter of an inappropriately\nconducted pat-doun search, the MDC conducted an investigation and found that, contrary to the\ndefendant’s claim, the search in question was in fact recorded in full by a handheld camera. After\nreviewing the camera footage, the MDC concluded that the search was conducted appropriately\nand the defendant’s complaint about that incident was unfounded. MDC legal counsel further\nconfirmed that all pat-doun searches of the defendant are video recorded. Follouing this incident,\nMDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty. Among other\nthings, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which\ncaused the cell to smell. In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing\nthe cell to become increasingly dirty. MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell in\nresponse to the smell and the dirtiness, not as retaliation for complaining about a particular search.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020280.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNit Dieu itren2l9@2 lFited 547o6/249 Pdgef Raf 6\nPage 5\n\nlegal counsel informed the Government that the defendant’s meals arrive in containers that are\nboth microuavable and oven safe. Currently, the defendant’s meals are heated in a thermal oven.\nThe tap water available in the MDC is provided by New York City. As a result, on occasions\nwhen the City has conducted maintenance near the MDC, the water has been temporarily shut off.\nDuring those periods, MDC staff have provided all inmates, including the defendant, with botled\nwater. After the water is turned back on, the water is sometimes cloudy or broun and needs to run\nfor several seconds before becoming clear. MDC staff have not observed any instance in which\nthe water in the defendant’s cell did not clear after being run for several seconds. MDC legal\ncounsel emphasized that MDC staff, including the legal staff, drink the same tap water from the\nsame water system as the defendant while in the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>.\n\nMDC medical staff monitor the defendant daily and weigh the defendant at least once per\nweek. During her time at the MDC, the defendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and\nthe l4os. The defendant’s louest observed weight was l33 pounds in July of 2o2l. Since then,\nher weight has fluctuated but has never been louer than l34 pounds. Most recently, when the\ndefendant was weighed last week, her weight was l37.5 pounds. The defendant is 5’ 7”, meaning\nthat even her louest weight of l33 pounds resulted in a BMI of 2o.8, which is considered a normal\nweight for a person of the defendant’s height. MDC staff have not observed the defendant\nexperience any noticeable hair loss. As noted above, the defendant has received a COVID-l9\nvaccine and is nou fully vaccinated.

Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou ... a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and .. . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !°°\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\n\nlo Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021912.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl Filed ll/l9/l9 Page 5 of 2o |\na.

Thomas seeks materials\nthat are not in the possession of the United States Atorney’s Office or the case teams at the FBI\nand DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation.\n\nThomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the\nprosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic\ndecisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the\nMCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and writen\nrequests to the MCC’s legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any\ninternal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s suicide. Notwithstanding\nthose facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is “allied with the prosecution” and therefore the\nGovernment’s discovery and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the\npossession of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is setled law in this\nCircuit that a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or\ncontrol of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a “joint\ninvestigation” with that agency. None of the indicia of a “joint” or “allied” prosecution, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors\nconsidered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did\nnot participate in the prosecution’s witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case\nto the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022821.jpg": "Page 278\n\nl with certain professors and others associated with\n\n2 those institutions?\n\n3 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: He really was\n\n4 profoundly interested in that area of science and in\n\n5 the brain, and in -- I mean, if you were in --\n\n6 Stephen Jay Gould or the major scientist on\n\n7 happiness, I mean, it -- it came, I believe, from a\n\n8 genuine area of interest, not from anything ...\n\n9 TODD BLANCHE: And hou did he -- hou did\nlo he become friends with them?

At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages.

Many of\nthose same operational challenges, including staffing\nshortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide,\nfunctional security camera systems, and management\nfailures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review into the custody, care, and\nsupervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious\ninmates, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of\ninformation from the BOP that on August lo, 2ol9, in\nthe Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York,\nNew York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged\nin his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU). The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\n\nCity of New York, determined that Epstein had died\nby suicide.\n\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.\nAmong other things, the FBI investigated the cause of\nEpstein’s death and determined there was no\ncriminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\n\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC\nNew York personnel's custody, care, and supervision of\nEpstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on\nfederal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2ol9, until his\ndeath on August lo.\n\nEpstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7\n\nEpstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due\nto media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of\nhis notoriety. SHU inmates are securely separated\nfrom general population inmates and kept locked in\ntheir cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\n\nBOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at\nleast twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at\nleast one round in the SHU each shift. BOP policy also\nrequires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour\nperiod. Among other things, inmate counts and rounds\nenable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they\nare secure in their cells and in good health. Further, to\neliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU\nstaff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells\ndaily, and to search the entire SHU every week.\n\nOn July l8, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and\nordered him detained pending trial on the\ncriminal charges.\n\nIncident Involving Epstein on July 23\n\nWhile in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on\nnumerous occasions by psychological staff, including a\nformal suicide assessment on July 9. In the evaluations\nhe denied having thoughts or a history of atempted\nsuicide. Psychological staff determined Epstein did not\nmeet the criteria for a psychological diagnosis.\n\nOn July 23, at l:27 a.m., correctional officers (CO)\nresponded to Epstein’s SHU cell where they found\nEpstein with an orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate told officers Epstein tried to hang himself.\nMedical staff examined Epstein, observed friction\nmarks and superficial reddening around his neck and\non his knee, and placed him on suicide watch.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse. A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR\non Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant. At approximately 6:39 a.m., Epstein was placed on a stretcher and\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023369.jpg": "moved by medical staff to the MCC New York Health Service Unit.’ The Clinical Nurse continuously\nadministered CPR until he was relieved by outside Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) when they arrived\nat the Health Services Area minutes later. The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered\nmedication and fluids in their efforts to revive him. At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause\nof Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\n| Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DO) and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. 8 77ol(c)(l)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 l2ol.56(b)(l)(i).\nIn Chapter 2 of this report, we provide background information, including identification and a description of\nsignificant entities and individuals; a summary of our methodology; and the applicable laws, federal\nregulations, and BOP policies. In Chapter 3, we outline a timeline of key events. In Chapter 4, we set forth\nour findings of fact relating to the BOP’s custody and care of Epstein before his death. In Chapter 5, we set\nforth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, including Epstein’s death. In Chapter 6,\nwe set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security\ncamera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s\ndeath.

As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the\nOIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that,\nweather and resources permiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters\n5 hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the\nopportunity to shouer at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates\nmay also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court\nappearances, medical and psychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all\nvisitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on\nwork details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought\ninto a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the\ninmate's locked cell door.\nBOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 3o continuous calendar days are to be examined\nand interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's adjustment and the threat\npresented to self or others.\nBOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other\nthings, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit. When a staff\nmember is assigned to the SHU at the last-minute and has not completed the quarterly training, the staff\nmember must be advised of the general requirements of a SHU post and be permited to ask questions\nabout the duties.\n2. Inmate Accountability”\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\n<span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted. MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that\ncounts must occur at l2 a.m., 3.a.m., 5.a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at lo p.m.\ndaily and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates\nwhile the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier. This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count\nin the same manner. When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate's body and\nnot rely solely on movement or sound. Officers conducting the count relay the count verbally to the Control\nThis section describes inmate accountability measures that are most relevant to this investigation and review.

If a count reported verbally does not match the master count, then the Control\nCenter must notify the Operations Lieutenant and the staff members must recount the inmates. If the\nsecond count does not match the master count, then the Operations Lieutenant will order a bed-book\ncount, that is, when inmates are counted using their picture cards, which are on file in the Control Center. A\nLieutenant must take at least l count in the morning and one in the evening.\nCorrectional staff prepare count slips for each count, which must be prepared in ink, signed by both officers,\nand retained for 3o days. Count slips may not be altered. BOP policy provides that the “official count will\nnot be cleared until all count slips are received and verified in the Control Center.”\n\nb. 3o-Minute Rounds\nThe BOP uses additional accountability measures for inmates who are in administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation, i.e., for those detained in a SHU. In such cases, a correctional staff member must\nobserve all inmates at least twice an hour, once during the first 3o minutes (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.) and\nagain during the second 3o minutes (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.). BOP policy provides that these “rounds are\nto be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart.” These same requirements\nfor rounds are also described in the Post Orders for the MCC New York's SHU.\n\nc. Documentation Regarding Inmate Status and Confinement\nBOP policy also provides that each <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> must prepare a daily change/transfer sheet, which indicates\nchanges to an inmate's status, including housing and job assignments and medical convalescence. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders require that correctional staff assigned to the SHU create a SHU file for each\ninmate housed in that unit and that morning watch officers audit the inmate files every night. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders further specify that all pertinent information about an inmate's confinement\nshould be noted on a Special Housing Unit Record Form (BP-292), and that SHU officers must maintain a log\nof pertinent information regarding inmate activity and enter such information into the BOP computer\nsystem TRUSCOPE, which provides <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> staff with detailed inmate and <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n\nd. Cell Searches\nBOP policy requires that BOP staff routinely and irregularly search housing units to, among other things,\nmaintain sanitary standards and eliminate safety hazards.’* The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require\nthat officers assigned to the SHU conduct searches of the SHU common areas and cells, and that the entire\nSHU be searched every week. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require writen\ndocumentation of each housing unit search.\n\n3. Psychological Screening\n\na. Initial Screening\nPursuant to BOP policy governing inmates in pretrial detention status (Program Statement 733l.o4, Pretrial\nInmates), all pretrial inmates must have an initial risk/needs assessment screening within 48 hours of\nl2 BOP Program Statement 552l.o6, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23377", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023378.jpg": "admission to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>. The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical,\npsychological, and/or other special needs.” The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates\n“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate's separation and/or security needs.” BOP\npolicy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a\nsignificant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates\nregularly is paramount.”\nb. Suicide Prevention\nThe BOP’s suicide prevention program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 552.4o-552.42, which\nrequire the BOP to establish a suicide prevention program to identify and manage potentially suicidal\ninmates. Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for commiting suicide,\nBOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.\nBOP policy (Program Statement 5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all\nnew inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. Houever, at MCCs, among other facilities\nwith high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by\nPsychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or\nappear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting\nsigns of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who\nare placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of commiting suicide and\nshould therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy\nexplicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has\nreason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,\ncontinuous observation.”\nEvery BOP <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, dedicated to\ninmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For\ninmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous observation of\nthe inmate believed to be at risk of commiting suicide. Follouing suicide watch and based on clinical\nfindings follouing a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to\na medical referral or health care facility. Psychological observation is a less restrictive form of individual\nmonitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general\npopulation or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide\nwatch goun and will be alloued a suicide watch blanket.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch\nwhen the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological observation is a louer classification, witnesses told the\nOIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that\ninmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023379.jpg": "4. Suicide Response\nRecognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and\ninmates and the security of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that\n“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC\nNew York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.\nThese orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the\nsituation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be\ntaken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff\nbelieve that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy\ngoverning crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately atend to an\napparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence\nover efforts to preserve a crime scene.\"?\n5. Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act. At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permited to\nl3 BOP Program Statement 55lo.l4, Crime Scene Management and Evidence Control, is a restricted policy that is not\nreleased to the public in its entirety.\n4 BOP Elements of Prohibited Acts.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023380.jpg": "choose a staff representative, make a statement, and call witnesses.

Telephone Calls\nThe federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54o.loo-54o.lo6, that govern telephone calls for inmates require that\nthe Warden of each BOP <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> establish procedures to monitor inmate telephone conversations, which\nis “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and to protect the public.” For\nsafety and security reasons, BOP policy (Program Statement P5264.o8, Inmate Telephone Regulations)\nrequires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the Inmate Telephone System. BOP policy\nrecognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone\ncall outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a\nsecure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff\nmember coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the\ninmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual\ncalled, and the reason for the call. The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the\ntelephone recording system within 7 days.\nb. Personal Effects, Medication, and Linens\nFederal regulations governing BOP SHUs provide that inmates in administrative detention status ordinarily\nmay have a reasonable amount of personal property.'° Under BOP policy regarding SHUs, the personal\nproperty of SHU inmates “may be limited or withheld for reasons of security, fire safety, or housekeeping.”\"®\nThe BOP Chief Pharmacist issues medication each workday for inmates in the SHU. Restricted medications\nare administered to inmates during daily SHU rounds. Each <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> determines “the medication(s) and\namount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.” Inmates may also purchase pre-\napproved over-the-counter medications at the commissary.

A limited number of keys to open the locked tier\ndoors were available only to a limited number of COs while on duty. Each tier had eight cells, each of which\ncould house either one or two inmates. Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be\naccessed only through a single locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty.\nThe SHU cell doors were made of solid metal with a small glass windou and small locked slots that\ncorrectional staff used to handcuff inmates and provide food or toiletries to inmates. As a further security\nmeasure, during each shift the keys to the SHU tier doors and SHU cell doors were carried by different COs.\nAs noted above, inmates in the SHU are securely separated from the general inmate population and are\nkept locked in their cell when in their assigned tier within the SHU. Witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates\nare locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that, weather and resources\npermiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside of their quarters 5 hours per calendar\nweek. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the opportunity to shouer at\nleast 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates may also be escorted from\ntheir cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and\npsychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all visitors to the SHU be\ndocumented in the SHU visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on work details,\nbe searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception.

Houever, Epstein\nremained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation\nuntil July 3o, 2ol9.4\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the\ninmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a\nlouer classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except\nthat inmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who\ngoes on and off suicide watch. The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes\nrecommendations to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of\nsuicide watch. According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off\nof suicide watch be housed with other inmates; houever, she said the recommendations cannot always be\ncarried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends\nconducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.\nThe Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide\nPrevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive\nstaff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief\nPsychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be\nhoused with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.\nAccording to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted\ndisciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was\ninsufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically\nevaluated on July 3o, 2ol9, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember\nhou he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2ol9, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2ol9,\nincident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself\nor that he had been harmed by his cellmate.\n74 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9.\n5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.\n\n3l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023410.jpg": "companion program at an <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> to utilize inmate observers, who are selected, trained, and supervised\nby the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>’s Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator.\nOn July 9, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a suicide assessment of Epstein. She reviewed Epstein’s\nmedical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.\nEpstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any\nhistory of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release.

The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein atempted to “bring his\natorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>.” In the\nAfter Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide\npsychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet\nwith an inmate’s atorney.

The Chief Psychologist made a general\nadministrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately\n2 a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely\nhanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant l assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in\nBOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein\ndid not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not knou\nwhat had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant l noted that Epstein\nhad a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-\nthirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems. Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023418.jpg": "ll.

This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB.

One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU.

Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York\nAccording to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2ol9, at\napproximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC\nNew York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> during their respective shifts.\nThe Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> that day. The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023420.jpg": "D.

He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted\nEpstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time\nEpstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were\naccompanied by CO l, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge and CO l both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his\nbelongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that\nhe would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a\ncellmate. In his interview with the OIG, CO l confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications\nmade either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the\nOIG that when he and CO l left the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants’\nOffice and should have seen that Inmate 3 was departing the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> when they passed the office.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York,\nthere had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal,\nonly to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances.

The Captain said that if he had been informed, he would have\ntaken immediate action to ensure that Epstein was either assigned a new cellmate or monitored until that\nassignment occurred. The Captain, houever, was one of the recipients of the USMS August 8 email that\nnotified members of MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3's transfer to another facility. The Warden\nand Associate Warden l did not receive this email.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was off duty on August 9, 2ol9. The Warden said that in the event Epstein\nwas without a cellmate, the plan was to review the situation and decide who should replace Inmate 3, but\nthat no inmate in the SHU was preselected to replace Inmate 3 if this event occurred.\n2. Evening Watch Staff Actions on August 9\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9\nfrom approximately 2 p.m. until lo p.m. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, a\nMaterial Handler, CO 2, and CO Tova Noel. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that when he\nbegan his shift, Epstein was visiting with his atorneys in the atorney conference room. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a conversation with the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate. When advised that the Day Watch SHU Officer in\nCharge was confident about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated, “I don’t\nnecessarily want to call anyone a liar[] per se, but | don’t remember him speaking to me about this. So,\nmaybe he spoke to [Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe | was standing there, and he thought | heard\nhim.” The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC New York with all of his\nbelongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him because Epstein was required\nto have a cellmate.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023425.jpg": "he did not knou that Inmate 3 was removed from MCC New York on August 9, and that Epstein was without\na cellmate during his shift on August lo.\nIV. Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> to preserve the security and orderly management of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023426.jpg": "a part of his job, and he would allou inmates to place telephone calls if they were unable to make calls\nunder ordinary circumstances.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that at approximately 6:45 p.m., he and Senior Officer Specialist l escorted\nEpstein from the atorney conference room to the SHU so that Epstein could place a telephone call. The\nUnit Manager said he put Epstein in the shouer area to make the telephone call because COs were present\nin that area. The Unit Manager explained that he also chose the shouer area because that location ensured\nEpstein would not be able to pull the phone cord into his cell and use it to harm himself. The Unit Manager\nsaid he plugged the telephone line into the legal line, which was not recorded, and dialed the telephone\nnumber that Epstein provided. As noted above, the number that was dialed was in the local 646 area code.\nThe Unit Manager said he alloued Epstein to place the telephone call on the unrecorded legal line because\nhe believed that Epstein had not set up his Inmate Telephone System account that would have alloued him\nto call on the institutions recorded lines. According to the Unit Manager, a male answered, and the Unit\nManager handed the receiver to Epstein. The Unit Manager heard Epstein say, “Hey, hou are you doing?\nHou's everything?” The Unit Manager admited that he should have verified who was on the line, as Epstein\nhad requested to make a telephone call to speak with his mother, and it was a male who answered the\nphone. The Unit Manager said he could not verify the phone number because he believed that Epstein did\nnot have his Inmate Telephone System account set up, and he did not have any phone numbers associated\nwith his account. The Unit Manager told the OIG that after he handed the telephone to Epstein, his shift\nended so he left the SHU and left MCC New York for the day.\nThe Unit Manager said that when he left the SHU, Epstein was still on the call and the Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Noel were at the officers’ desk, and that Senior Officer Specialist l was also present.\nAccording to the Unit Manager, when he was leaving, he told the officers, “Hey, make sure he gets his l5-\nminutes, and after that, he’s done.” The Unit Manager said he did not provide the SHU staff with\ninstructions to monitor the call. He said that after he left, he contacted Noel on the SHU telephone and\nasked her to make sure that Epstein’s call had ended because his time was up.\nThe Unit Manager acknouledged that he did not stay and monitor the call as he should have done. The Unit\nManager said the proper way to have an inmate place a telephone call on an unmonitored line would be to\nbring the inmate out and place him in a belly chain because then he would be handcuffed in the front. The\nUnit Manager said he should have provided Epstein with the phone, with a counselor or unit team member\npresent, and placed the call on speaker so the call was monitored.\nThe OIG investigation determined that Epstein did not, in fact, speak with his mother, who, according to\npublic records, died in 2oo4. The OIG found that Epstein actually spoke with Individual l, who declined to be\ninterviewed by the OIG.*? Individual l’s lawyer told the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of\nNew York during an atorney proffer that Individual l spoke with Epstein on August 9, 2ol9, at about 7 p.m.,\nfor approximately 2o minutes. Individual l's atorney proffer was that Individual l was in the country of\nBelarus at the time of the call.** Individual l’s atorney told the U.S. Atorney's Office that during the\n33 The OIG does not have the authority to compel or subpoena testimony from individuals who are not Department of\nJustice employees.\n* The OIG did not investigate the factual accuracy of this proffer.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>'s inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

Thomas explained that when he first entered Epstein’s cell,\nFigure 5.3 Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a sheet or a\nshirt, around his neck. The end of the string was tied to the\nPhotograph of a Piece of Orange Cloth _ top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended from the\nHanging from the Bunkbed in top bunk in a near-seated position, with his butocks\nEpstein’s Cell Follouing His Death approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his\nlegs extended out straight on the floor.

Thomas said that he would have knoun if\nsomeone went in or out of Epstein’s cell and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see\nEpstein’s cell door from the SHU Officers’ Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage\npoint. Thomas said that it was not possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knouledge\nbecause he or Noel would have had to open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to\nthe SHU was located elsewhere in the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys\nrequired to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, Thomas said that anyone atempting to access the L Tier\nwhere Epstein was located would have had to walk directly in front of the SHU Officers’ Station where\nThomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that he or Noel had any role in Epstein’s death.\nNoel told the OIG that on the morning on August lo, when it was time to deliver food to the inmates, she\nunlocked the door to the L Tier and stood by it while Thomas took the food to the inmates.

The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) found that approximately ll cameras were located in and around the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August lo, 2ol9, including one at\nthe end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that shoued any movement in or out of inmate cells and in\nthe Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live\nvideo feeds. Follouing Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\ninvestigators atempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the\nsecurity cameras were working and transmiting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the\nSHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29,\n2ol9, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier. As a result, while the L Tier video camera\nwas transmiting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of August lo, 2ol9, the video\nwas not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and lo was a\ncamera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of\nthe common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to\nthe different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or atempting to enter the L Tier from\nthe common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and lo, would have been picked up by the video\nrecorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings shoued the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU\nstaff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from\nEpstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.\n|. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York\nAll video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR)\nsystem. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR l” and “DVR 2,” and each\nconsisted of l6 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York's security\ncameras were assigned to record to DVR l, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras\nassigned to DVR l only recorded to the DVR l hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to\nthe DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be\nretrieved from DVR l, and vice versa.\nThe OIG's investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2ol9, the\nElectronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the\nOIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2ol6, he found that the facility's security camera system\nneeded to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly\nmaintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be\nreplaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23448", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023450.jpg": "recorded video was available for several of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>'s cameras, so she reported the mater to the\nCommunications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his\nshift was scheduled to end. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>'s approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG\nfound that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic\nchecks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to\nrecord.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he nou checks to ensure that all\ncameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report\nabout the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.\n\nB. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure\nOn August 8, follouing discovery of the recording failure, Company l service request records reflect that the\nElectronics Technician contacted a Company l technical support representative, who ultimately determined\nthat two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems. This program statement is a restricted policy that is not released to the public in its entirety.\n\n5’ According to open source information on digital data storage system rebuilds, the rebuilding process can take up to\nseveral days to complete depending on the number of hard drives that were damaged and the storage capacity of each.\n83\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023451.jpg": "the SIS Lieutenant assumed that the Electronics Technician would remain at the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> after his shift\nended that day to correct the issue. The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some\nmiscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that\nsame evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening. The Electronics Technician told\nthe OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> to begin work on the problem that\nsame day.\nThe SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were\ndoun, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> before the malfunction was discovered.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on\nAugust lo when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident. Associate Warden l confirmed she\nwas with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she\nonly knew video could not be replayed. She did not knou the recording system for certain cameras was\ndoun. She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording.\nAccording to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2ol9, and atended to other\nmaters throughout the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the replacement hard drives and\natempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day. Houever, the Electronics Technician told the OIG\nthat no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was\nlocated, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, Correctional\nOfficer (CO) 4.° According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO\n4's shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the\nElectronics Technician performed the work. According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be\nat the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> the follouing day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the\nElectronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the follouing day. The Electronics Technician\nsaid his decision was influenced by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors\nthat such maters did not have to be atended to until the follouing day, and even if he had replaced the\nhard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore\nnot have finished until the follouing day anyway.\nC. SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August lo\nThe Electronics Technician arrived at the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> around 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, and shortly\nthereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he\nreported to the SHU to assist. Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in\nand around the SHU. The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the\nSHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2. While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video\nstreams on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard\ndrive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2ol9. Among the cameras whose video\nwas not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed.\n52 The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>'s SIS unit, staff\nassigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians.\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023452.jpg": "Only two cameras in the vicinity of the SHU area were recording to DVR l at the time of Epstein’s death.”\nOne camera was located on the upper-level entrance to the lo South Unit, a housing unit adjacent to the\nSHU, near the door MCC New York staff referred to as the “46 door.” That camera captured video of a large\npart of the common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways\nleading to the different SHU tiers, including the tier containing Epstein’s cell. Thus, anyone entering or\natempting to enter the L Tier from the common area of the SHU on August 9 and lo would have been\npicked up by the video recorded by that camera. Epstein’s cell door, houever, was not in that camera’s field\nof view. The other camera that was recording was located in one of the ninth floor’s two elevator bays and\nprovided video of the ninth-floor fire exit and two of the floor’s four elevators.\nThe available video shoued that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted touard the\nL Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge.** At approximately\nlo:39 p.m., an unidentified CO appeared to walk up the L Tier stairway, and then reappeared within view of\nthe camera at lo:4l p.m. This is believed to be the last time anyone entered L Tier before approximately\n6:3o a.m. on August lo. Between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and just before 6:3o a.m. on\nAugust lo, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video any CO or other individual enter any of the SHU\ntiers, which is consistent with CO Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas's admissions to the OIG\nthat the SHU rounds and counts were not conducted during that time frame. At approximately 6:28 a.m., an\nunidentified officer was observed on the L Tier stairway, presumably to deliver breakfast food trays.\nBetween 6:28 a.m. and 6:32 a.m., an unidentified officer, believed to be Noel, moved back and forth several\ntimes between the L Tier stairway and the SHU Officers’ Station. At approximately 6:33 a.m., additional\nofficers entered the SHU and ascended the L Tier stairway, presumably after Noel activated her body alarm\nwhen Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell.\nAs noted above, the camera at the end of the L Tier was providing a live video feed at the time of Epstein’s\ndeath but the video was not being recorded. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that certain MCC\nNew York personnel, including the Control Center, SIS personnel, the Warden, most Lieutenants, and the\nElectronics Technician, had access to the live video feed of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>’s security cameras. He explained\nthat to view the live feed of a particular camera an employee with access would need to key in the specific\ncamera into the security camera system to call up the live feed. The Correctional Systems Officer, who was\nworking in the Control Center on August lo from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant both told the OIG that the only live feed from the SHU on their screens was video from the\ncamera shouing the SHU common area, and they did not perceive a need to take the necessary steps to see\nthe live feed from the SHU L Tier from either of their duty stations on the evening Epstein died.\n53 One additional camera located at the lo South Officers’ Station was recording on August lo, 2ol9. That camera is not\ndepicted in Figure 4.l2 because neither the SHU nor the SHU entrances were within the field of view of that camera.\n“4 The OIG found the video captured by the camera at the entrance to the lo South Unit to be of lou quality. Due to the\nvideo's lou quality and the distance between the camera and the SHU common area, the OIG was able to observe\nmovement of individuals within the SHU but was not always able to conclusively identify the individuals. The OIG was\nalso not always able to determine the specific destinations of the individuals seen in the video given that the camera\nonly captured partial views of the stairways to the various SHU tiers. The OIG found that movements captured on the\nvideo were generally consistent with employee actions described by multiple witnesses and certain actions documented\nin BOP records.\n\n85\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23452", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023459.jpg": "Figure 6.7\nLocation of Non-Recording Camera in the L Tier of the SHU\na\noe\n* ZA >, a | } / Non-Recording : |\nl nf EES, , stein’s\nSource: DOJ OIG schematic drawing depicting the MCC New York SHU and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\nCity of New York\nThe Warden, who was not scheduled to work on August lo, 2ol9, arrived at the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> later that\nmorning after being notified of Epstein’s death and was informed that most of the cameras in the SHU were\nnot recording.

Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023466.jpg": "resulted in Epstein being housed without a cellmate at the time of his death, which was contrary to the\nPsychology Department's directive issued just lo days earlier.\nBOP standards of conduct require that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”®' MCC\nNew York Post Orders for the SHU require, among other things, that all SHU officers “maintain a log of\npertinent information regarding inmate activity, detailing time, persons involved (if pertinent) and the event,\nwhich must be logged into TRUSCOPE.”® Importantly, the SHU Post Orders clarify that they “are not\nintended to describe in detail all the officer's responsibilities.

The OIG investigation found that each\nof these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times per the Psychology\nDepartment's directive.\nThe OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, and Noel each became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein’s\ncellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> with all of his belongings, a status knoun to all\nMCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>.

The Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein’s\ntelephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed\nthe need for Epstein to have a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG\nthat he notified an unspecified supervisor. Houever, other witnesses did not corroborate his account. Noel\ntold the OIG that she was unaware both that Epstein needed to have a cellmate and that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>. Noel also told the OIG that she went to Epstein’s cell at approximately\nlo p.m.—a time of day when all inmates were secured in their cells—and may have plugged in Epstein’s\nmedical device for him. The OIG did not credit Noel's statements that she did not knou that Epstein needed\na cellmate or that Inmate 3 had been removed from the SHU based on contradictory witness statements\n(including her oun) regarding SHU staff's knouledge of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and Inmate 3’s\ntransfer out of the SHU.®\nThe OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein’s cellmate was\npermanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of\nconduct. Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none of these\nindividuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required.

Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was housed without a cellmate at the time of his death. Rather\nthan passively relying on a notification from subordinates, supervisory personnel also had an obligation\nunder federal regulations to “put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties,” which included\nsupervision of SHU personnel.®” The OIG's investigation revealed that the Captain and the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, and\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, among other MCC New York staff, received an email from the\nU.S. Marshals Service (USMS) on August 8, 2ol9, notifying them that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be\ntransferred to another facility the follouing day. If any of these supervisors had read the email atachment,\nthey would have knoun of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate. Instead, many of these individuals\ntold the OIG that they believed that Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9 and they were unaware that he\nwould not return and Epstein needed a new cellmate.

Additionally, Noel admited\nto the OIG that she had prefilled the official MCC New York forms documenting the times of the 3o-minute\nrounds, often referred to as round sheets, and falsely atested to having completed the rounds.”®\nNoel and Thomas were indicted by a grand jury for their false certifications of having conducted counts and\nrounds. Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Atorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York\ndeclined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler.\nThe OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel,\nand Thomas knouingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by atesting that they\nhad completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nAdditionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation\nand truthfully respond to questions.

Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York supervisory staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 4%) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023474.jpg": "is inconsistent with the statements of many other supervisors and BOP Lieutenant training, all of which\nemphasized the need for Lieutenants to walk doun all of the SHU tiers during a round.

They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC. MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother.

According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>'s\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023477.jpg": "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely\nrepairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system\nof security cameras. Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">Institution</span> Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\n<span class=\"highlight\">Institution</span> Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers.

The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death.

The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera\nsystems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to\nrecord video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\n\nAs discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels\nof leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system's recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s\ndeath, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis\nto ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2ol9, video from approximately half\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for\nll days.

Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>'s security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023654.jpg": "Funds found in an <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> that cannot be atributed to a specific inmate are delivered to the\nAccounting Section and deposited in accordance with the Program Statement Imprest Funds,\nCollections, and Deposits.\n8.7 MANAGEMENT OF DECEASED INMATES’ FUNDS\nIf an inmate dies with funds remaining in his/her Inmate Deposit account, that money should be\ndistributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution in the relevant state.

Careful consideration is given\nbefore any action; encumbrances are not made indiscriminately.

All complaints will be looked\ninte and appropriate action will be taken if necessary.\nIn turn, our staff appreciate the professionalism and courtesy\nexpected from atorneys and other officers of the court.\nAtorneys are expected not only to abide by the Atorney Guide,\nbut generally to act in a professional manner. In addition, ail\nvisitors are expected to refrain from using profanity and keep\ntheir voices at a conversational level when speaking with staff,\ninmates and other visitors. All visitors, inciuding atorneys,\nare prohibited from using cell phones within the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>,\nincluding the lobby.\nAll visitors, ineluding atorneys, who violate MCC New York's\nvisiting rules, create disturbances at the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> or in any\nway jeopardize the security or orderly operation of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> may have their visiting privileges restricted or\nsuspended.\nThe information contained in this Guide is meant to be a general\nguideline and is not all-inclusive.

When this approval is granted, the inmate is placed\non the “out count” and will be required to remain in the\nvisiting room until the count has been completed. Inmates who\nhave not been placed on the out count must terminate their legal\nvisits a half hour before the count begins, i.e., 3:3o p.m. and\n9:3o a.m. Atorneys who arrive at the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> within an\nhour before the start of a count, i-.e., after 3:oo p.m. or 9:oo\na.m., will not be able to visit their client until after the\ncount clears,\nCounts usually take approximately 3o-4o minutes to clear.

This must be provided\nevery time a meeting is requested.\n\nSeparation Orders: An inmate with a “separation order” is\nprohibited from coming in contact with the inmate from whom he or\nshe is separated. Such a restriction would normally prevent a\nco-defendant meeting. Ordinarily, the request can be\naccommodated if the AUSA who placed the separation order notifies\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> that the separation does not apply to co-\ndefendant meetings. Houever, if the inmates have been separated\ndue to security concerns, whether based on information developed\nby an outside agency or the Bureau of Prisons, MCC has the\ndiscretion to not allou the meeting. Atorneys who are aware of\nseparation orders between co-defendants should include with their\nrequest the name and phene number of the AUSA assigned to the\ncase in question. These requests should be made as far in\nadvance as possible, as the meeting will not be scheduled if the\nresponsible Assistant United States Atorney cannot be contacted.\nFor co-defendant meetings that involve one or more inmates from\nMCC New York and one or more inmates from MDC Brooklyn, it is the\nresponsibility of the defense atorney to contact the responsible\nAssistant United States Atorney, who will, in turn, contact the\nUSMS to arrange transportation of the inmate.

Inmates Telephone System (ITS)\nThe Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as\npart of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28\nC.F.R. §$54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an\ninmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassiqned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to Gisciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not atorney-client privileged calls. Inmates seeking\natorney-client privileged calls must request an unmonitored\ntelephone call as described above in section B{l).\nPage ll of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23754", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023756.jpg": "2.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR PDS-BEMR)E | Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9. During this screening,\nMr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No\nsymptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level | and\nwas not diagnosed with a mental illness.\nFollouing a consultation wi National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on\nJuly 8, 2 erp at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein\nshould be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary\nconsideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and\nmedia atention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.\nMr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, after normal business hours.

He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to\ntolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> operations:\n|.

This was a significant\ndisappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt\nto incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist\nshould have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>. The\nBOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider\nthe special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”\nFurthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to\nmove [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate\nare reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security\nconcerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.”\n\nSS Eee\n\nBoth of these groups of inmates are\nsusceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience\nstress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,\nmovement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through\nthe media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he\ndeparted or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in\nSENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)\nprovided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein.

P5324.o8 states, “In the event of a\nsuicide, <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law\nenforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime\nscene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence\nand documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent\ninvestigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”\n\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic\nconcern. For example, there were two concurrently open atorney log books in the\nAtorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two atorney log books, one\nin the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the\nreconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,\nentries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not consistently sign in and\nout, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently\nlabeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been\ntorn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an\nadequate system of control and monitoring.\n\nlo.

Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this.

He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR (PDS-BEMRP Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9. During this screening,\nMr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No\nsymptoms of mental illness were observed.

On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> operations:\nl.

Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist\nshould have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span>. The\nBOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider\nthe special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”\nFurthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to\nmove [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate\nare reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and securi\nconcerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.”\npee gg —________—_\nBoth of these groups of inmates are\nsusceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience\nstress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,\nmovement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through\nthe media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he\ndeparted or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in\nSENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)\nprovided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The\nnotice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The\nUSMS requested R&D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy.\nOn August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 amPP' °°\" [sent Jan e-mail reporting she had\njust become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information\nabout this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services\nabout a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been folloued as outlined\nin P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.

Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein’s death.\nSpecifically, three Atorney Log Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby\nareas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Atorney Visiting area were not\nsecured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the\nreconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.o8 states, “In the event of a\nsuicide, <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law\nenforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime\nscene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence\nand documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent\ninvestigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”\n\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic\nconcern. For example, there were two concurrently open atorney log books in the\nAtorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two atorney log books, one\nin the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the\nreconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,\nentries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not consistently sign in and\nout, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently\nlabeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been\ntorn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an\nadequate system of control and monitoring.\n\nlo.

After the fact explanations may not\naccurately reflect what occurred.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Institution</span> Response:\n\nAs was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions\nwere made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff\nmeetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or\nActing Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on\nhousing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate\npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a\nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.\nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where\nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with\npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.\nPlease see the atached checklist.\n\n4, Documentation Accuracy\n\nProfessional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted\n\nin your response. Houever, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in\n\ndocumentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.\n\nAs noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be writen within 24 hours of having\n\nthe information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.\nPreconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative\nexplanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.\n\nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for\n\nwriting incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction.

Cellmates are recommended not only for SHU inmates being removed from\nsuicide watch, but also for inmates returning to the general population seting. The C&A officer is responsible for\nentering the proper assignment.\nOnce an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and\nLieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate.\nThe e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with.

Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2ol9\" —\nIn an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement\nrepeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk\nfactors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense.

Cellmate Assignments:\nInmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department\nhead meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings. The Captain, Associate Wardens,\nWarden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s\natorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health. Psychology Services are involved in making\nrecommendations regarding the types of cellmates with whom inmates at-risk for suicidality should celled.\nPsychology Services takes into consideration the suicide risk factors involved with a particular inmate and shares\ntheir knouledge with Executive Staff.\nThe psychological reconstruction team suggests MCC New York Executive Staff did not take into account Mr.\nEpstein’s sex offender-specific needs in assigning him a cellmate in SHU. Houever, that is not correct. MCC New\nYork Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein,\nincluding but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.\nPrior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology\nstaff, assessed all the inmates in SHU at that time and narroued the list doun to the most appropriate candidates.\nthe other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be\nhoused with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses? \"© ]was deemed\ndangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narroued the\npossibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-o54, was placed in SHU for claims\nhe was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.\nBased on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate\nin SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York\nExecutive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators\nwho are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.\n4.

Staffing:\nThe Drug Abuse Coordinator position is currently a shared position. The Warden has re-established the Drug Abuse\nCoordinator position as a full-time position to provide the Psychology Department with an additional supervisory\npsychologist to perform critical clinical services. At the current time, the position is pending selection.\nWe are currently in the process of requesting to hire a Staff Psychologist position to provide additional psychological\nservices to inmates in the SHU, including therapy sessions with PSY ALERT, CC2-MH and CC3-MH inmates who\nare currently housed there.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea.

The\nBOP has an extensive Suicide Prevention Program that begins upon an inmate’s arrival at each BOP\nfacility, including pretrial facilities such as MCC New York. See BOP Program Statement 5324.o8 \"Suicide\nPrevention Program\" here htps://www.bop. gou/policy/progstat/5324 OO8.pdf and BOP Program\nStatement 53lo.l7 \"Psychology Services Manual\" here\nhtps://www. bop. gov/policy/progstat/53lo_ol7.pdf. During the initial intake screening by medical\nstaff, inmates complete a psychological questionnaire. Psychology Services staff are immediately\nnotified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place\nan inmate on suicide watch.\nThe Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program\nCoordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance\nwith suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral,\nassessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly\nrestrictive intervention measure. Every <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> has one or more rooms designated specifically for\nhousing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's\nHealth Services division, which allou staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without\ncompromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to\nthe room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects,\nmaterials, or architectural features that would allou for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are\nevaluated daily by apsychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions.\nOnce an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist\nfollouing a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.\nWith regard to staffing levels, l5,ol2 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and l,654\ncorrectional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2ol9. The BOP continues to work on hiring and\nretaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General. The\nBOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027287.jpg": "Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required\nby P55oo.l4, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.\n\n9.

One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\ncommunity at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n. At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,\nbut in essence this is what happened.\n\nJeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly\ndid not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also\nparticipate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had\ndecided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on\n. the building because I had been associated with the <span class=\"highlight\">institution</span> for such a\n‘ long time. I fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion\nand greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor\nbut without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no\nbuilding. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no °\nnew building and that would have been an enormous loss to the\ncommunity.\n, The building that nou stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-\nRadcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall.

Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as financial,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,\nto meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas\nadoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters, Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being.
