Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s leter, dated August l3, 2o2o, responding to Ms. Maxwell’s request that the\nCourt (i) direct the government to disclose the identities of the three alleged victims referenced\nin the indictment, subject to the restrictions of the protective order in this case; and (il) order the\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery\nmaterials (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt. 4l).\n\nWith regard to the issue of alleged victims’ identities, the government concedes, as it\nmust, that this Court has the authority and discretion to order the relief sought, but claims that\nMs. Maxwell’s application should be denied as untimely and without merit. (Gov’t Resp. at 2-\n4). Instead, the government asserts that the appropriate and timely way for Ms. Maxwell to seek\n<span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> of their identities is through a request for a bill of particulars, which should be filed\nin December 2o2o. (/d. at 3). The government then notes that it would oppose such a motion,\nwhich it claims should also be denied. (/d.). The government concludes that it will finally\nprovide <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> of their identities in the 35oo material and a witness list to be provided\nshortly before trial. (/d. at 4).\n\nThe upshot of this is clear: in the government’s view, Ms. Maxwell should not knou the\nidentity of the three witnesses referenced in the indictment until at best just before trial, and\nshould have to spend the next eleven months (or longer) trying to conduct a defense\ninvestigation, in a case in which she is presumed innocent, without having this information.\nThis information is critical to conducting a meaningful defense investigation, given that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 4 of 9l 4\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl falls within that category, so they may call in to that number.\n2 MS.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span>, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.' This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\n<span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span>, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page4of5\ndeadline to submit requests for jury selection dates in the third quarter of 2o2l is May l5.\nFollouing the submission of requests, the Clerk’s Office will assign jury selection dates\naccording to a protocol that has rules of priority.

Among detained defendants, cases that set trial dates prior\nto March l6, 2o2o get priority. For any detained defendants whose trial date was set after March\nl6, 2o2o, priority is based upon who has been detained the longest. Absent a grant of an\nadjournment, by May l5, the Court will request a jury selection date as close to July l2, 2o2l as\npossible.

Second, Maxwell’s\nrequest was ambiguous as to the length of adjournment being requested. As noted, the leter\nargued a 9o-day adjournment was necessary but also suggested that some number of her defense\ncounsel would not be available until January 2o22. And third, by this Order the Court denies\nMaxwell’s request for a renewed bail hearing.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.'°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher. He served in that detail until he left\nthe Department in February 2oo8.\n\n62\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l89 of 349\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24o of 349\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\n<span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span>, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4537\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page9ofl7\npersistence” and “<span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> bias” are at work. Belief persistence occurs when an opinion\nformed is resistant to change even when proven wrong. <span class=\"highlight\">Confirmation</span> bias occurs when an\nindividual forms an opinion early in the decision-making process and then evaluates new\ninformation in a way that supports the earlier decision.' The jury questionnaire is the first\nopportunity jurors have to tell the lawyers and the Court what they are thinking and, more\nimportantly, what influenced them to think that way.\n\nGiven the likelihood intense media scrutiny of this trial, it is critical to use both a robust\nwriten jury questionnaire and individual sequestered voir dire to inquire about the extent to\nwhich each potential juror has been exposed to pretrial publicity and to what extent each juror\nhas formed an opinion of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein\n\nBecause there is always the fear that a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the entire\njury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity, a jury\nquestionnaire and individual voir dire in a case such as this is particularly warranted. If the Court\nwere to engage in public questioning of the venire panel en masse, answers could infect the\nentire panel. Alternatively, concerns about a panel member’s unanticipated answer may render\nthe questions too carefully worded to uncover the problem. Further, questions asked pose privacy\nconcerns that would require constant side bars. A questionnaire can solve some, but not all, of\nthese issues.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire would encourage jurors to answer questions more\ncompletely and more honestly because the jurors would not be influenced by (or influence) the\nanswers given by fellou jurors or fear embarrassment in giving an honest response. Jurors avoid\nthe pressure to give “right” or socially acceptable answers in front of a large group or to parrot\n!

(Def. Ex. O). Accepting the financial report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself.

In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach.

The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span>, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021262.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O88 3536o38, Page9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Our Office cannot\n\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision.

During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county.

The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nI. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span>, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release.

First names of girls,\ndates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I\nrecognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been\ninterviewed. The body of the messages was time of the day that they\ncalled for <span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> of \"work.\" Other names and telephone numbers\nwere located in which the body of the messages were, \"I have girls for\nhim\" or \"I have 2 girls for him.\" These messages were taken by Sarah\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. Based on the context of the body of the\nmessages, I requested subpoenas for subscriber information on the\ntelephone numbers and the time frame involved. Copies of the messages\nwere made for evidentiary purposes. :\nI obtained xy carbooks for 2oo5, 2oo4 and\n2oo3. I first reviewed the 2oo5 yearbook and located most of the\ngirls I had spoken with. Additionally, I located _~ :\nBased on the corrected name spelling, I was able to locate her to her\nresidence in Loxahatchee. On December 8, 2oo5, Det. Caristo and I\nresponded to l8o5 C Road in Loxahatchee. I located — at\nher home. She advised she is atending I figh and is\nparticipating in the early release program so she can maintain her\npart time job. As she is still a minor, I left my business card to\nhave her mother return my call to request an interview with her\ndaughter. We then left the area.\nI also had previously researched the telephone number for \"{§lend\ntelephone number a A subpoena had been issued for the\ninformation on 56l-64o-79l2. The telephone number was registered to\nScot NED A ciery of NINN, coc2le4\nthat she is the daughter of Scot nd is currently residing at\nDet. Caristo and I atempted\ncontact with ith negative results. I left my business card on\nher front door requesting she return my call. We then responded to\nI also atempted contact with\nMr. ith negative results. I left my business card for him to\nreturn my call.\no7/26/l7 Page 258l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032913.jpg": "Date: 4/2o/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 76\n\nTime: l3:o2:26 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\n\nCase No. . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Cont inued)\nthree years old when she met Epstein, anything that happened was\nbetween two consenting adults. I explained to her that she was not in\nany trouble houever as part of this investigation, I needed to ask\ncertain questions. Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein\nwould ask her to perform during the massage. He would instruct her to\nrub his nipples as he masturbated himself. Sjoberg stated she felt\n\"grossed\" about the behavior but as she was geting paid, she just\ncontinued. Sjoberg also advised she would on occasion perform the\nmassages naked. Epstein would on occasion, utilize the\nvibrator/massager on her vagina area when she performed the massages.\nSjoberg explained that Epstein never exposed himself to her as he\nmaintained himself covered under the touel he would be wearing. When\nEpstein would masturbate he would be covered.\nI asked if Sjoberg ever received any gifts, or any gratuities from\nEpstein. Sjoberg advised aside from being paid well, she advised\nEpstein took care of her tuition from Palm Beach Atlantic College.\nShe received a rental car for a week when her scooter broke doun.\nAdditionally she received other gifts from Epstein. Epstein also\nrecommended her to another client who resides at Breakers Rou in Palm\nBeach. The client she was referred to was \"Glenn\" unknoun last name,\nand his wife, who she provided a massages to. The statement was\nconcluded and placed into evidence upon our return to the Palm Beach\nPolice Department.\nWhile at the police station, I researched Florida tag X88-EFF which\nwas also previously seen on the property when there was physical\nsurveillance being done at the property. The vehicle is registered to\nCraig Eaton of , Florida. Researching Mr. Eaton and the\nvehicle revealed that his daughter, QMMpad been driving\nthe vehicle and was cited for unlawful speed in Lake Clark Shores.\nThe vehicle is a tan, Chevrolet Camaro, 2-door. I researched na\nMMMM date of birth, ll-l8-l987, resides at 33o7 Blatusrol Lane in\nLake Worth. Eaton has a my space page called\nwww.myspace.com/pinkpetals. In her web page, shous various photos of\nEaton photographed at a beach. An interview is forthcoming.\nA review of the video disks which was extracted at the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff's Office Computer Crime Unit revealed that only one\nhidden camera was functional at the time. Several images of Epstein\nworking at his office were seen. Additional footage of Sarah Kellen\nand Nadia Marcinkova was seen. There was other footage of females\nseen. The identity of the females is unknoun at this time, until such\ntime as I meet with certain females to shou the video footage to\nconfirm if, in fact, it is them on the video. At this time it appears\nCHaG nee ee and Haley Robson are seen siting with Epstein beside\nhis desk in the evening hours. Due to poor lighting, a direct\n<span class=\"highlight\">confirmation</span> cannot be made at this time.\nInv.
