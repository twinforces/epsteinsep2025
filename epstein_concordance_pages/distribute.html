It is not accessible on-line via PACER, but someone can go to the\nClerk’s Office to obtain a copy.\nA non-prosecution agreement would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our\ncase file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span>\nwithout compulsory process.\nOn the obstruction charges, many of the facts I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our |\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of EE: = We will need to interview her to confirm the accuracy of |\nthose facts.

The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.”°’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOIA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”””8 Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy. The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”*?? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”*°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... I am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\ncoordinate hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.

July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span>\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.

The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> the monies based on the strength of each case.

Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”°°? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”*°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call...

July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span>\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 26\ndefendant under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Whatever Epstein’s rights and obligations were\nunder the NPA, including his obligation to plead guilty to two state solicitation offenses, the NPA\nis simply an agreement between Epstein and the USAO-SDFL. The USAO-SDFL’s agreement to\ndecline to prosecute other offenses is not an adjudication of any facts that goes to the merits of\nthose offenses. Nor could it be: neither Epstein nor the defendant was charged with those offenses,\nand the NPA was never put before a judge who could engage in fact-finding or even so-order the\nagreement. There is no sense in which the defendant risked conviction or was ever in genuine\njeopardy. See Dionisio, 5o3 F.3d at 84.\n\nThis point is only underscored by United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d 6o3 (2d\nCir. l979), on which the defendant relies. In that case, two defendants, Jesus and Rosalinda\nLosada, were prosecuted for a l974 conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> cocaine, resulting in a guilty plea for\nJesus and, “as part of his plea bargaining agreement, the dismissal of charges against” Rosalinda.\nId. at 637. The two were later charged as part of another cocaine conspiracy. Jd. at 6o7. The\ndefendants argued that the new prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause as to both of\nthem, and the plea agreement as to Rosalinda. /d. at 637. The Second Circuit remanded for the\ndistrict court to reconsider its decision in light of its other holdings narrouing the charged\nconspiracy. It added that “[i]f Jesus’s earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of him because of\ndouble jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the charges against\nRosalinda, the instant prosecution of Rosalinda will also be barred.” /d. at 638. That is, if double\njeopardy barred re-prosecution of Jesus, the prosecution of Rosalinda was barred because of the\nplea agreement.

Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nie\nDOJ-OGR-oooo528l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005677.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 2l\nallege three distinct episodes of alleged sexual abuse, in three different locations, involving three\nseparate accusers.

Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nDespite the government’s confidence, Court Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is\nconsidering a conviction on Count Four based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and\nalleged sexual abuse that purportedly took place in New Mexico. Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring. Ms.\nMaxwell has no burden to prove prejudice at this point since the variance can still be prevented by\n2o68538.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the\npossible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the indictment has\nbeen constructively amended.” (cleaned up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive amendment found\nwhen defendant was convicted of misbranding drugs on an entirely distinct misbranding theory\nthan the one charged in the indictment); Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8 (constructive amendment\nfound when defendant was charged with possession with intent to <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> cocaine and\nmethamphetamines, but the proof at trial shoued possession with intent to <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> marijuana);\nRoshko, 969 F.2d at 4-6 (constructive amendment found when defendant was charged with a\nconspiracy to change the immigration status of an alien, but the proof at trial related to a\nconspiracy with an entirely distinct object).\nD. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n? Engaging in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law.

Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\n<span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> cocaine and one to <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F.

Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement.

The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree.

Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nDespite the government’s confidence, Court Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is\nconsidering a conviction on Count Four based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and\nalleged sexual abuse that purportedly took place in New Mexico. Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring. Ms.\nMaxwell has no burden to prove prejudice at this point since the variance can still be prevented by\n2o68538.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o852\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020916.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page9o of 22l\nA-29o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 638 Filed o3/o9/22 Page 2 of 29\ny Juror ID: o |\nYour name will not be disclosed or connected to this questionnaire beyond the Judge and the |\nparties iri this case, Houever, if you believe that any of your answers contain private |\ninformation that could embarrass you or otherwise seriously compromise your privacy and co\nwish to request that the Court keep them confidential and not <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> them beyond the Judge\nand parties, please indicate the particular question number at the end of the questionnaire,\nSUMMARY OF THE CASE |\nThe Court is selecting a jury for a trial commencing on Monday, November 29, 2o2l.\nAlthough it is never possible to predict the length ofa trial, currently this trial is expected i\nto last approximately six weeks. a\nThis is a criminal case.

Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\n<span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> cocaine and one to <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F.

Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement.

The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v.

Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein.

Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez].

Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.””? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”°°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... I am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\ncoordinate hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.

Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span>\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense.

No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023419.jpg": "Epstein, and he said he told the second atorney that Epstein could not be housed without a cellmate\nbecause of his prior suicide atempt.\nC. Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York\nAccording to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2ol9, at\napproximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC\nNew York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts.\nThe Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would <span class=\"highlight\">distribute</span> to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023435.jpg": "Fi 5.2 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that\ngure 5.\nNoel filled out the round sheet on behalf of everyone who was\nworking in the SHU during his shift.
