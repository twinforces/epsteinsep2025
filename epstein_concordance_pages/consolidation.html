Punn, 737 F.3d l, 5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that\ncome within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail,\nmotions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of\nantipsychotic medication. See Se// v. United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal <span class=\"highlight\">consolidation</span>, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The\ncriminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a protective order while the civil\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool826", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002784.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page4ofl8\ninstead guided by concerns of efficiency.

The civil case\naddresses an order by Judge Preska unsealing certain deposition material.\n\nAmong other arguments for <span class=\"highlight\">consolidation</span> of the two appeals, Ms. Maxwell\ncontends that she should be permited to share with Judge Preska critical\ninformation Ms. Maxwell learned from Judge Nathan.\n\nBut the protective order issued by Judge Nathan prevents Ms. Maxwell from\ndisclosing this information to Judge Preska or from telling this Court about the\ninformation in the civil appeal. By contrast, the protective order allous Ms.\nMaxwell to tell this Court about the information in the criminal appeal, though only\nunder seal since it is confidential and sealed in the district court criminal case.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Unredacted Motion to Consolidate explains this situation\nand describes the critical information. But to comply with criminal protective\norder, Ms. Maxwell can file an unredacted copy of the Motion to Consolidate only\nunder seal with this Court, and then only in the criminal appeal, Case No. 2o-3o6l.\n\nTherefore, in compliance with the criminal protective order, Ms. Maxwell\nwill publicly file on ECF a redacted copy of the Motion to Consolidate in both\nappeals along with all but one of the exhibits — Exhibit B, which was filed under seal\nin the district court.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019295.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l7, o9/lo/2o2o, 2928288, Page9Y of l5\n\nee\nee\na\n\nMs. Maxwell has appealed Judge Preska’s order unsealing the deposition\nmaterial, Giuffre v.
