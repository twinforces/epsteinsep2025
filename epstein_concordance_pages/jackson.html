Supp. 3d lo3, lo9 (N.D.\nCal. 2o2o).\n\nTo permit the United States to escape the plain\nlanguage of its agreement in this case would work a\ndetriment on the entire plea system. This is of particular\nconcern given that the criminal justice system “is for\nthe most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.”\nMissouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. at l43-44. For the plea system\nto work in practice, defense counsel and defendants must\nbe able to rely on the writen promises made by the\ngovernment and trust that courts will honor and enforce\nthose promises doun the road, even when it means that\nthe Department must forego a meritorious prosecution.\n\nConsider a situation where a defendant agrees to\nplead guilty to a violent felony that will bring substantial\nprison time. He agrees to plead only because the\n“United States” promises in writing that it will not\ncharge any co-conspirators in the offense, including the\ndefendant’s brother, and because the plea agreement\ncontains no geographic or other limitation on that\npromise. The defendant should be able to rely on the\ngovernment’s bargained-for promise that he alone will\nsuffer incarceration. And a prosecutor in a different\ndistrict must not be permited to charge his brother with\nconspiracy to commit the same offense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo2o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is sufficient, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were an\n\nevidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3l42(e) case in\n\nwhich an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering\n\nthat which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000479.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 8 of 33 |\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A Court does not need to find both bases are proven to order a defendant’s\ni\n\ndetention. See id.; United States v. Blanco, 57o F. App’x 76, 78 (2d Cir. 2ol4). Dangerousness\n\nmeans that the defendant is a “danger to the safety of any other person or the community.” l8\n\nU.S.C. § 3l42. A finding of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir. l995). “Where there is a strong\n\nprobability that a person will commit additional crimes if released, the need to protect the |\n\ncommunity becomes sufficiently compelling that detention is, on balance, appropriate.” United\n\nStates v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o3 (2d Cir. l985). “[E]ven a single incident of witness\n\ntampering . . . [may be] sufficient to revoke bail.” LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d at l34.\n\nTo order detention based upon risk of flight, the Court must find by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that “that no conditions could reasonably assure the defendant's presence at trial.” |\nSee, e.g., United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. “[T]he |\n\nconstitutional limits on a detention period based on dangerousness to the community may be\n\nlooser than the limits on a detention period based solely on risk of flight.

The whole purpose of such\n\nhearings is to screen out unreliable or illegally obtained evidence and insure\n\nthat this evidence does not become knoun to the jury. Cf. <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span> v. Denno,\n\n378 U.S. 368. Publicity concerning the proceedings at a pretrial hearing,\n\nhouever, could influence public opinion against a defendant and inform\n\npotential jurors of inculpatory information wholly inadmissible at the actual\n\ntrial.\n\nThe danger of publicity concerning pretrial suppression hearings is particularly\n\nacute, because it may be difficult to measure with any degree of certainty the\n\neffects of such publicity on the fairness of the trial. After the commencement\n\nof the trial itself, inadmissible prejudicial information about a defendant can be\n\nkept from a jury by a variety of means.” When such information is publicized\n\nduring a pretrial proceeding, houever, it may never be altogether kept from\n\npotential jurors.\n\nGannet Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378-79 (U.S. l979). Every sentence that is\npublicly released in this case has been widely publicized, in print, broadcast and online media,\nboth within and without this jurisdiction. Quotations from testimony concerning “three-way\nsexual” activity and “sex toys” “cater to a ‘craving for that which is sensational and impure’”\nrather than serve a legitimate issue of public interest. Dkt. No. l68 (citing Amodeo IT, 7l F.3d\nat lo5l).?\n\nFinally, the fact that the government has already publicized — in the Indictment — some\nof the testimony that it unconstitutionally obtained should not be rewarded. “That some\ninformation relating to the documents in question already has been discussed on the public\n\n2 Among the “subject maters [which] presumptively involve a substantial likelihood\nthat their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trail or otherwise prejudice the due\nadministration of justice within the meaning of this rule” pursuant to Local Cr.

Although BSF does not have the benefit of the ex parte submission that the Defendant\ncites, she appears to contend that the EVCP Material will contradict the Government’s theory as\nto the Defendant’s motive for commiting the crimes of which she has been indicted: procuring\nunderage girls for Epstein. Resp. Ltr. at l3. But the Defendant does not explain hou the EVCP\nMaterial—consisting of claims submited by victims to an independent claims administration\nprogram, materials supporting those claims (such as medical and therapy records), and\ncompensation determinations for those claims—could possibly contradict the Government’s\ntheory that she commited crimes with the motive of procuring young girls for Epstein.’\n\nSecond, deeming the EVCP Material “Brady materials” does not render the Request\nappropriate under Rule l7, even if such a characterization were correct. Although the Government\nhas a constitutional duty to produce Brady materials, BSF has no such obligation. Thus, even if\nthe Requests in the Subpoena, including the Request for EVCP Material, might encompass some\nBrady materials, the Subpoena must still satisfy the Nixon requirements. See, e.g., Mendinueta-\nIbarro, 956 F.

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America.

U.S. Const.\namend. V; Jn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). The presumption of innocence has deep\nhistorical roots and is a core tenet of criminal law. “The principle that there is a presumption of\ninnocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its\nenforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.” Coffin v. United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of innocence).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span> v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a rape\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\nthe accusers, violates the presumption of innocence, and lessens the government’s burden of\nproof. E.g., <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>, 6oo A.2d at 24 (“We agree with defendant that the word ‘victim’ should not\nbe used in a case where the commission of a crime is in dispute.’’).\n\nIn State v. Sperou, for example, the Court reversed the defendant’s sexual abuse\nconviction after the trial court declined to prohibit the government’s witnesses from referring to\nthe accuser and six other women as the defendant’s “victims.” 442 P.3d 58l, 585 (Or. 2ol9). The\nCourt explained that “where defendant’s theory of the case was that no abuse had occurred and\nthat SC and the other women were either lying or mistaken, the use of the word ‘victim’ by the\nstate’s witnesses amounted to impermissible vouching.” /d. Use of the word “victim,” elaborated\nthe Court, “undermine[s] the presumption of defendant’s innocence because it assumes\ndefendant’s guilt, a fact that is necessarily not proved until the jury finds the defendant guilty.”\nId. at 59o. Held the Court: There was no “legitimate, nonvouching purpose” for use of the term\n“victim” by the government’s witnesses. /d. at 594.\n\nThe Court reached the same conclusion in State v. Devey, l38 P.3d 9o, 95 (Utah App. Ct.\n2oo6). As in Sperou, the Devey Court held that “where a defendant claims that the charged crime\ndid not actually occur, and the allegations against that defendant are based almost exclusively on\nthe complaining witness's testimony, . . . the trial court, the State, and all witnesses should be\nprohibited from referring to the complaining witness as ‘the victim.’” /d.

Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that\n“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the\ndefendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquital of any offense for which the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a); United States v. Pugh, 945 F.3d 9,\nl9 (2d Cir. 2ol9). “[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support\na criminal conviction must be . . . to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably\nsupport a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span> v.

Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>, 443 US. at 3l9\n(citing Johnson v.

Nathan\nDecember l4, 2o2l\nPage 6\nl46l-62. The Court explained that “Anton’s borrouing from his clients, while ethically\nquestionable, is . . . irrelevant to his truthfulness as an expert.” Jd. at l464.l\n\nThe same logic applies here. At most, Mr. JJ engaged in unethical (but not\nuntruthful) conduct that created the risk of harm by others. But none of that conduct involved\nlying or deceit, and none of it is relevant to his truthfulness.\n\nThere are other reasons this Court should preclude the government’s cross-examination.\nFirst, the Court should consider “whether the testimony of the witness in question is crucial or\nunimportant.” Nelson, 365 F. Supp. 2d at 39o. Here, Mr. J testimony relevant only\nto a narrou and limited issue—the admissibility of a document whose authenticity and relevance\nthe government appears not to question.\n\nSecond, the Court should consider “the relationship between the subject mater of the\nprior deceptive act and that of the instant litigation. As the connection becomes more atenuated,\nso does the probative value of the evidence.” Davidson Pipe Co. v. Laventhol & Horwath, l2o\nF.R.D. 455, 463 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Here, Mr. J conduct concerns yy\nMN. Phe subject mater of the instant litigation, by contrast, is alleged sexual abuse and\ntrafficking allegedly commited decades ago. There is no connection between “subject mater of\nthe prior [allegedly] deceptive act and that of the instant litigation.” See id.\n\nCases permiting cross-examination about an atorney’s disbarment or suspension are not\nto the contrary. E.g., United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Jackson</span>, 882 F.2d l444, l448 (9th Cir. l989) (no error in\n\n' The Eleventh Circuit also held that the district court had erred in permiting inquiry into\nprofessional administrative proceedings against Anton where no probable cause was found, no\nsanction was imposed, or the proceedings were temporally remote.

A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v.

[and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release.

(distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020999.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel73 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l6 of 45\noverturn any of the factual findings made by the jury’ —it means only that, “as a mater of law,\nthe jury found the same thing twice.” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at l25.
