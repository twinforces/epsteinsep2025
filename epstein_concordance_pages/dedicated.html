Her only source of information was from the guards who controlled her. They became the\nsource of information regarding rules, regulations, and opportunities. If they chose not to dispense\ninformation or if they provided incorrect information, she had no basis to challenge them. She was\ninstructed not to speak to them lest she face disciplinary sanction. Such is not the case in general\npopulation, where inmates assist other inmates and bear witness to and identify inconsistent and\nimproper treatment.\n\nUnlike other inmates, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to various prohibitions and deprivations\nnot common to other inmates. She was monitored 24 hours a day by stationary security cameras\nand by an additional hand-held camera that folloued her while under the constant surveillance of\nseveral prison guards who scrutinized her every move, even when she was shouering, and taking\nnotes of her activities and recording them in various notebooks. The procedures in place deprived\nMs. Maxwell of any privacy and prevented uninterrupted sleep. The constant illuminations during\nthe night disrupted her sleep, leaving her sleep deprived and causing exhaustion that affected her\nability to concentrate. Initially, she was denied adequate and restful sleep by bright lights left on\nin her cell for 24 hours a day coupled with a flashlight shining into her eyes or cell every l5 minutes\n'* The cost of her individualized detention should be of great concern to the taxpaying public and warrants\nan investigation into the propriety of this enormous expenditure for a single non-violent inmate.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo469", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 46 of 77\npeople, she fully recognizes hou much her whole life has dramatically changed.

I assure you that upon her release, under probation and\nbeyond, just as she never commited a single crime before her arrest, nor will she commit any other\ncrimes, and instead, dedicate her entire life and work to helping the world.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the deleterious effect of the conditions under which Ms.\nMaxwell is detained. Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera <span class=\"highlight\">dedicated</span> to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical,\npsychological, and/or other special needs.” The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates\n“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate's separation and/or security needs.” BOP\npolicy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a\nsignificant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates\nregularly is paramount.”\nb. Suicide Prevention\nThe BOP’s suicide prevention program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 552.4o-552.42, which\nrequire the BOP to establish a suicide prevention program to identify and manage potentially suicidal\ninmates. Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for commiting suicide,\nBOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.\nBOP policy (Program Statement 5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all\nnew inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. Houever, at MCCs, among other facilities\nwith high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by\nPsychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or\nappear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting\nsigns of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who\nare placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of commiting suicide and\nshould therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy\nexplicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has\nreason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,\ncontinuous observation.”\nEvery BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, <span class=\"highlight\">dedicated</span> to\ninmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For\ninmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous observation of\nthe inmate believed to be at risk of commiting suicide. Follouing suicide watch and based on clinical\nfindings follouing a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to\na medical referral or health care facility. Psychological observation is a less restrictive form of individual\nmonitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general\npopulation or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide\nwatch goun and will be alloued a suicide watch blanket.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch\nwhen the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological observation is a louer classification, witnesses told the\nOIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that\ninmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23378", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023396.jpg": "IV. Events of July 23 and the Placement of Epstein on Suicide Watch and\nPsychological Observation from July 23 to July 3o\nAccording to BOP documents, at approximately l:27 a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, Senior Officer Specialists l and 2\nheard noise coming from the M Tier in the SHU, the tier where Epstein was housed. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 documented in a BOP report that upon checking cell Zo5-l24, he saw Epstein laying doun near\nhis bunk with “a piece of handmade orange cloth” around his neck, and Senior Officer Specialist l wrote in a\nBOP report that Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate l) said Epstein had atempted to hang himself. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said that Inmate l, who appeared shaken up, told him that he had\nbeen asleep on the floor of the cell and was awoken when he felt Epstein land on him. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the\nControl Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer Specialist l entered the cell, where they\nsecured and removed Epstein’s cellmate. Senior Officer Specialist l reported that he then reentered the\ncell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was atached to the\nbunkbed ladder in the cell. Senior Officer Specialist l said that Epstein was siting on the floor of the cell\nwith his back against the bunkbed ladder. Senior Officer Specialist l's report said that Epstein was\nbreathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant and other staff arrived. Senior Officer Specialist l confirmed in his OIG interview that they\nstarted cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU,\nshe saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and\nboxers. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no\nfurther injuries. She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring. The COs\nunsuccessfully tried to get Epstein to stand on his oun, and then placed him on a stretcher and took him to\nthe Health Services Unit.\nAccording to BOP records, at approximately l:4o a.m., Epstein was transferred out of the SHU and placed on\nsuicide watch. As previously noted in Chapter 2, inmates on suicide watch are housed in a <span class=\"highlight\">dedicated</span> room,\ntypically in the health services area, where they are continuously monitored by specially trained staff\nor inmates.\nSenior Officer Specialist 3 documented in a BOP report that when he and others responded to the call for\nassistance and gained access to the SHU, he saw Epstein lying on the floor of his cell snoring. He and the\nother officers verbally instructed Epstein to stand up, but Epstein did not. He and other officers then lifted\nEpstein onto a stretcher to remove him from the cell.\nSenior Officer Specialist 4 wrote in a BOP report that he responded to a body alarm in the SHU and helped\nremove Epstein from his cell, placed him on a stretcher, and took him to the second floor for a medical\nassessment. Senior Officer Specialist 4 further reported that, while he was observing Epstein in the Health\nServices Unit, Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 that he thought his cellmate had tried to kill him.\nEpstein further stated that his cellmate had tried to extort him and that for the last week his cellmate had\nthreatened to beat him if he did not pay him. Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 he had not reported\nthis to MCC New York staff, but that he had told his lawyers.\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23396", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024821.jpg": "Page 283\ndismissed in June l976 for inadequate development as a teacher.

These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida.

Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9.

The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida.

The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical,\npsychological, and/or other special needs.” The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates\n“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate's separation and/or security needs.” BOP\npolicy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a\nsignificant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates\nregularly is paramount.”\nb. Suicide Prevention\nThe BOP’s suicide prevention program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 552.4o-552.42, which\nrequire the BOP to establish a suicide prevention program to identify and manage potentially suicidal\ninmates. Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for commiting suicide,\nBOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.\nBOP policy (Program Statement 5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all\nnew inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. Houever, at MCCs, among other facilities\nwith high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by\nPsychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or\nappear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting\nsigns of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who\nare placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of commiting suicide and\nshould therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy\nexplicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has\nreason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,\ncontinuous observation.”\nEvery BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, <span class=\"highlight\">dedicated</span> to\ninmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For\ninmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous observation of\nthe inmate believed to be at risk of commiting suicide. Follouing suicide watch and based on clinical\nfindings follouing a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to\na medical referral or health care facility. Psychological observation is a less restrictive form of individual\nmonitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general\npopulation or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide\nwatch goun and will be alloued a suicide watch blanket.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch\nwhen the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological observation is a louer classification, witnesses told the\nOIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that\ninmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23378", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023396.tif": "IV.

Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 documented in a BOP report that upon checking cell Zo5-l24, he saw Epstein laying doun near\nhis bunk with “a piece of handmade orange cloth” around his neck, and Senior Officer Specialist l wrote in a\nBOP report that Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate l) said Epstein had atempted to hang himself. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said that Inmate l, who appeared shaken up, told him that he had\nbeen asleep on the floor of the cell and was awoken when he felt Epstein land on him. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the\nControl Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer Specialist l entered the cell, where they\nsecured and removed Epstein’s cellmate. Senior Officer Specialist l reported that he then reentered the\ncell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was atached to the\nbunkbed ladder in the cell. Senior Officer Specialist l said that Epstein was siting on the floor of the cell\nwith his back against the bunkbed ladder. Senior Officer Specialist l's report said that Epstein was\nbreathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant and other staff arrived. Senior Officer Specialist l confirmed in his OIG interview that they\nstarted cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU,\nshe saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and\nboxers. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no\nfurther injuries. She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring. The COs\nunsuccessfully tried to get Epstein to stand on his oun, and then placed him on a stretcher and took him to\nthe Health Services Unit.\nAccording to BOP records, at approximately l:4o a.m., Epstein was transferred out of the SHU and placed on\nsuicide watch. As previously noted in Chapter 2, inmates on suicide watch are housed in a <span class=\"highlight\">dedicated</span> room,\ntypically in the health services area, where they are continuously monitored by specially trained staff\nor inmates.\nSenior Officer Specialist 3 documented in a BOP report that when he and others responded to the call for\nassistance and gained access to the SHU, he saw Epstein lying on the floor of his cell snoring. He and the\nother officers verbally instructed Epstein to stand up, but Epstein did not. He and other officers then lifted\nEpstein onto a stretcher to remove him from the cell.\nSenior Officer Specialist 4 wrote in a BOP report that he responded to a body alarm in the SHU and helped\nremove Epstein from his cell, placed him on a stretcher, and took him to the second floor for a medical\nassessment. Senior Officer Specialist 4 further reported that, while he was observing Epstein in the Health\nServices Unit, Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 that he thought his cellmate had tried to kill him.\nEpstein further stated that his cellmate had tried to extort him and that for the last week his cellmate had\nthreatened to beat him if he did not pay him.
