During\nthose depositions, Cosby made several incriminating statements.\n\nD.A.

We granted allouance of appeal here as\nwell to consider the admissibility of that prior bad act evidence pursuant to Pa.R.E. 4o4(b).\nHouever, because our decision on the Castor declination issue disposes of this appeal,\nwe do not address the Rule 4o4(b) claim.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4 of 8o\ninvolved with, the university. That fall, she, along with a few other Temple administrators,\nshoued Cosby around the university’s then-recently renovated <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span> facilities. Over\nthe course of several telephone conversations concerning the renovations, Cosby and\nConstand developed a personal relationship.\n\nSoon after this relationship began, Cosby invited Constand to his Cheltenham\nresidence. When Constand arrived, Cosby greeted her, escorted her to a room, and left\nher alone to eat dinner and drink wine. Cosby later returned, sat next to Constand on a\ncouch, and placed his hand on her thigh. Constand was not bothered by Cosby’s\nadvance, even though it was the first time that any physical contact had occurred between\nthe two. Shortly thereafter, Constand left the residence.\n\nAs the personal nature of the relationship progressed, Cosby eventually met\nConstand’s mother and sister, both of whom atended one of Cosby's comedy\nperformances. Soon thereafter, Cosby invited Constand to return to his home for dinner.\nConstand arrived at the residence and again ate alone, in the same room in which she\nhad eaten during her first visit. When Constand finished eating, Cosby approached and\nsat next to her on the couch. At first, the two discussed Constand’s desire to work as a\nsports broadcaster, but Cosby soon atempted physical contact. Cosby reached over to\nConstand and atempted to unbuton her pants. When she leaned forward to prevent him\nfrom doing so, Cosby immediately ceased his efforts. Constand believed that her actions\nhad communicated to Cosby clearly that she did not want to engage in a physical\nrelationship with him. She expected that no further incidents like this one would occur.\n\nTouard the end of 2oo3, Cosby invited Constand to meet at the Foxwoods Casino\nin Connecticut. Constand accepted the invitation and, once at the casino, dined with\nCosby and a casino employee, Tom Cantone. After dinner, Cantone walked Constand\nto her hotel room.

He started on the varsity <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span> team as a freshman and was among the top\nplayers in the state his senior year. Although recruited by several colleges, he chose to atend the\nUniversity of Michigan, a state school, and gave up playing organized sports.\n\nWhat he did not give up was his work ethic. David got his first job at age ll,\ndelivering the Detroit News to his neighbors. Every day after school and on weekends, he rode\nhis bicycle on his route. In eighth grade, he began working part-time in a local restaurant as a\nbusboy (the same restaurant where his mother cleaned linens). He worked there on weekends\nduring the school year and 3o to 4o hours a week in the summer. The job enabled him to\npurchase a used car for $6oo. With a car, he could drive across toun to work at a famous\nseafood restaurant; beginning his senior year in high school, it became his regular employer.\n\nDavid graduated from Michigan in l984 with a bachelor’s degree in Business\nAdministration. He put himself through college, commuting from Ann Arbor to Detroit to work\nas a waiter in the seafood restaurant.

Carnaghi (David\n“ts truly a model father [who] sets the bar high for his boys”).”\n\nFor the past l5 years, David has devoted much of his free time to coaching youth\nsports teams in his community. In his leter to the Court, Phil Allen describes the depth of\nDavid's commitment:\n\nIn our toun’s Litle League Baseball organization, David has held\n\nevery volunteer position from an assistant coach to a team\n\nmanager. I have seen him do everything from raking baseball\n\nfields ...to throuing bating practice .... During <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span>\n\nseason, David has also been the coach or assistant coach for\n\nnumerous grammar school teams. If there is one example of the\n\ndepth of David’s commitment to coaching, it is the <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span>\n\ntraining sessions he designed and managed for students outside of\n\nthe organized teams he coached. On his oun initiative, David\n\narranged for a gym to be available during the week for all children,\n\neven those who didn’t make a team.... There are not many of us\n\n_. Who would find the time to make such an impact on the lives of\n\nthe children in their community.\n\nLeter of Phil Allen; see also leter of John and Kathryne Maguire (“[¢]oaching children is often\n\na difficult and thankless job in a small community; David has been a leader in Hinsdale in\n\nvolunteering his time and knouledge to help our community”),\n\n3 As the Presentence Report notes, Theresa has had serious health problems since 2oo8. In\n\nFebruary 2oo8, Theresa began experiencing severe dizziness, and the episodes often lasted hours\n\nand sometimes days. Neck pain, heart palpitations and stomach pain folloued. See leter of\n\nTheresa Parse, A batery of tests has proven negative, and medication and a change of diet have\n\ngiven her some relief. But health issues, which may be stress-related, continue to plague her.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009512.jpg": "Case D2oen8oB388 PAscUN Bot anent El662 o lRildd) BAILA) 2P ag Payef9S of ll7\nA-5936\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 7 of l4\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\nThe Honorable William H.

David relates to each child\nindividually and gives each a chance to play. When a boy with severe disabilities was on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span> team, David “made sure every other boy ... went out of [his] way to ... help him\nmake a basket before the end of the season.” Id. As one observer notes, David’s “measured,\npersonal approach contrasts markedly with the loud cacophony typically employed by [those]\n... who atempt to coach [children’s] sports teams.” Leter of Charles Austerberry.’\n\nWhat may best reflect David’s character is his commitment to his friends. In their\nleters to the Court, many of them recount stories of David’s support in their times of need. See\ne.g., leter of Bridget Rodgers (when I was pregnant and “told I had an infection that would cause\nOne parent whose child is a gifted athlete writes this about David:\n\nThe thing that has endeared me most to Dave is the way he\n\ncoaches the boys in <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span>.

Dave has\n\ngone out of his way to tell my wife Kimberly and me hou special\n\nMM is as an athlete and he encourages us to continue his\n\ndevelopment. The vast majority of coaches in our community are\n\nscreamers and not teachers and are singularly focused on their\n\n[oun] kids. Dave is different.

See leter of\nBridget Rodgers (“Dave comes from a blue-collar background; his dad was a mailman and his\nmom was a saint”). |\n\nDavid atended local Catholic schools, where he excelled in academics and sports.\nSee leter of Scot Mordell (“David was an academic, sports and social leader among our [high\nschool] class”). He started on the varsity <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span> team as a freshman and was among the top\nplayers in the state his senior year. Although recruited by several colleges, he chose to atend the\nUniversity of Michigan, a state school, and gave up playing organized sports.\n\nWhat he did not give up was his work ethic. David got his first job at age ll,\ndelivering the Detroit News to his neighbors. Every day after school and on weekends, he rode\nhis bicycle on his route. In eighth grade, he began working part-time in a local restaurant as a\nbusboy (the same restaurant where his mother cleaned linens). He worked there on weekends\nduring the school year and 3o to 4o hours a week in the summer. The job enabled him to\npurchase a used car for $6oo. With a car, he could drive across toun to work at a famous\nseafood restaurant; beginning his senior year in high school, it became his regular employer.\n\nDavid graduated from Michigan in l984 with a bachelor’s degree in Business\nAdministration. He put himself through college, commuting from Ann Arbor to Detroit to work\nas a waiter in the seafood restaurant.

Carnaghi (David\n“ts truly a model father [who] sets the bar high for his boys”).”\n\nFor the past l5 years, David has devoted much of his free time to coaching youth\nsports teams in his community. In his leter to the Court, Phil Allen describes the depth of\nDavid's commitment:\n\nIn our toun’s Litle League Baseball organization, David has held\n\nevery volunteer position from an assistant coach to a team\n\nmanager. I have seen him do everything from raking baseball\n\nfields ...to throuing bating practice .... During <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span>\n\nseason, David has also been the coach or assistant coach for\n\nnumerous grammar school teams. If there is one example of the\n\ndepth of David’s commitment to coaching, it is the <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span>\n\ntraining sessions he designed and managed for students outside of\n\nthe organized teams he coached. On his oun initiative, David\n\narranged for a gym to be available during the week for all children,\n\neven those who didn’t make a team.... There are not many of us\n\n_. Who would find the time to make such an impact on the lives of\n\nthe children in their community.\n\nLeter of Phil Allen; see also leter of John and Kathryne Maguire (“[¢]oaching children is often\n\na difficult and thankless job in a small community; David has been a leader in Hinsdale in\n\nvolunteering his time and knouledge to help our community”),\n\n3 As the Presentence Report notes, Theresa has had serious health problems since 2oo8. In\n\nFebruary 2oo8, Theresa began experiencing severe dizziness, and the episodes often lasted hours\n\nand sometimes days. Neck pain, heart palpitations and stomach pain folloued. See leter of\n\nTheresa Parse, A batery of tests has proven negative, and medication and a change of diet have\n\ngiven her some relief. But health issues, which may be stress-related, continue to plague her.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010191.jpg": "Cabasi2COAD CEB OAR rn BenorreaniGia® o HibsORS OBI ab dey e LG dfll/l 7\nA-5936\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 7 of l4\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\nThe Honorable William H.

David relates to each child\nindividually and gives each a chance to play. When a boy with severe disabilities was on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span> team, David “made sure every other boy ... went out of [his] way to ... help him\nmake a basket before the end of the season.” Id. As one observer notes, David’s “measured,\npersonal approach contrasts markedly with the loud cacophony typically employed by [those]\n... who atempt to coach [children’s] sports teams.” Leter of Charles Austerberry.’\n\nWhat may best reflect David’s character is his commitment to his friends. In their\nleters to the Court, many of them recount stories of David’s support in their times of need. See\ne.g., leter of Bridget Rodgers (when I was pregnant and “told I had an infection that would cause\nOne parent whose child is a gifted athlete writes this about David:\n\nThe thing that has endeared me most to Dave is the way he\n\ncoaches the boys in <span class=\"highlight\">basketball</span>.

Dave has\n\ngone out of his way to tell my wife Kimberly and me hou special\n\nMM is as an athlete and he encourages us to continue his\n\ndevelopment. The vast majority of coaches in our community are\n\nscreamers and not teachers and are singularly focused on their\n\n[oun] kids. Dave is different.
