Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page3of8\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 3\nsearches did not occur, witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a <span class=\"highlight\">contemporary</span>\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense.

That is, Plaintiff must prove\nthat Ms. Maxwell permited the publication of the statement knouing it to be untrue.\n\nNone of the witnesses identified are listed as having discoverable information regarding\nany of the elements of this claim.

To assist the defense in reviewing this discovery, the same day that the S2\nIndictment was returned, the Government provided the defense with a list of particular Bates\nranges that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4 and the charges contained in Counts Five and Six.\nAs a result, the Government has identified particularly relevant pieces of evidence regarding these\ncharges for the defense. (See Dkt. No. l88 at 3-4). This evidence includes, among other things,\nportions of message pads seized from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence referencing messages left\nby Minor Victim-4 during the period charged in Counts Five and Six; phone records reflecting\ncalls made by another Epstein employee to Minor Victim-4; Federal Express records reflecting a\nshipment from Epstein’s address in New York to Minor Victim-4; and <span class=\"highlight\">contemporary</span> photographs\nof Minor Victim-4. The Government has also provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s birth\nmonth and year.

It was a newly created position at the store, and it would have required me to leave FIT\na semester short of completing my degree. I had aspirations of going to law school and knew I could\nnot do so without my undergraduate degree, so I declined it.\n\nWhen Ghislaine found out she flew into a rage. I didn’t understand why until she told me\nthat she and Epstein were responsible for giving me that opportunity and that in turning it doun I\nwas being ungrateful. I nou knou this was their modus operandi — give a gift or favor and then\ndemand sex in return.

I never wanted to or expected to see them again.\n\nOne day in the fall of l995 Maxwell shoued up at Bloomingdales, looking tor me. When I\nasked her hou she knew where I was, she said she asked my colleagues at Henri Bendel. She\nimmediately began befriending me once again, asking me to go out socially. I tried to resist but\neventually she wore me doun and I began spending time with them again. They made me feel like\nthey were friends, contemporaries.\n\nIn one instance, they took me to Florida, insisted that I stay longer than planned which caused\nme to miss work and led to my being fired. Seizing on this new vulnerability, they began trafficking\nme to their friends. By that time, I was trapped.\n\nI was assaulted, raped and trafficked countless times in New York and Florida during a three-\nyear period.

(See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021471.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 595 3536o39, Page4l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the <span class=\"highlight\">contemporary</span> records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021620.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON Add 3536o39, Pagel9o of 2l7\n75\nM6SQOmaxSl\n\nl aspirations of going to law school, and I knew I could not do\n\n2 so without my undergraduate degree, so I declined it.\n\n3 When Ghislaine found out, she flew into a rage.
