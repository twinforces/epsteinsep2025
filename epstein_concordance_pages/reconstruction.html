According to the Psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024816.jpg": "Page 278\nFwd: Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> - Epstein #763l8-o54\nFrom Michael Carvajal\nTo Ray Ormond\nDate 2ol9/o9/l7 l6:o9\nSubject: Fwd: Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> - Epstein #763 l8-o54\natachintates TEXT.htm, Fwd: Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> - Epstein #763 l8-\no54\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: BOP-CPD/Assistant Director~\nDate: 9/l7/l9 2:l5 PM (GMT-o6:oo) a\nTo: Andre ST GaGE ee Michael Carvajal!\" bop. gov>\nSubject: Fwd: Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> - Epstein #763 l8-o54\nPage 69l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo248l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024817.jpg": "Page 279\n\nFwd: Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> - Epstein #763l8-o54\nFrom BOP-CPD/Assistant Director~\nTo Andre Matevousian, Michael Carvajal\nDate 2ol9/o9/l7 l5:l5\nSubject: Fwd: Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> - Epstein #763 l8-o54\nAtachments: TEXT.htm, Psych Reconst - Epstein #763 l8-o54.pdf\n\n>>> BOP-RSD/Assistant Director~ 9/l7/2ol9 3:o3 PM >>>\n\nPlease see atached.\n\nPage 695\nDOJ-OGR-ooo248l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024819.jpg": "Page 28l\n| Foe\noS U.S. Department of Justice\nENS Federal Bureau of Prisons\nReentry Services Division\nWashington, DC 2o534\nFy\nSEP 4 ¢ 2ol9\nMEMORANDUM FOR J.

James C. Wills,\nformer Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>. _The team consisted National Suicide Prevention\nCoordinator, Central Office; Sex Offender Treatment Programs Coordinator,\nCentral Office Pee ental Health Treatment Coordinator, Central Office; and\nCorrectional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This\n<span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,\na private school on the Upper East Side of Manhatan from September l974 until he was\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2482o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024832.jpg": "Page 294\nInmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required\nby P55oo.l4, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.\n\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein’s death.\nSpecifically, three Atorney Log Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby\nareas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Atorney Visiting area were not\nsecured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> and after the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> team advised staff to secure them. P5324.o8 states, “In the event of a\nsuicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law\nenforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime\nscene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence\nand documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent\ninvestigators doing a psychological <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>.”\n\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic\nconcern. For example, there were two concurrently open atorney log books in the\nAtorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two atorney log books, one\nin the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,\nentries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not consistently sign in and\nout, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently\nlabeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been\ntorn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an\nadequate system of control and monitoring.\n\nlo. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution\nrevealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and\nincomplete.\n\nll.

The Captain, Associate Wardens,\nWarden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s\natorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health.

Houever, that is not correct. MCC New\nYork Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein,\nincluding but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.\nPrior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology\nstaff, assessed all the inmates in SHU at that time and narroued the list doun to the most appropriate candidates.\nthe other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be\nhoused with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses? \"© ]was deemed\ndangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narroued the\npossibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-o54, was placed in SHU for claims\nhe was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.\nBased on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate\nin SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York\nExecutive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators\nwho are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.\n4.

The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as\nhe had writen in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff\nlog book.

Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the selection category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of\nthis determination.\nTo ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks\nare conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP3o Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.\nExecutive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.\nResults will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and\nresponsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll\nCall notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Atorney\nLog Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the\nAtorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> and after\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> team advised staff to secure them. P5324.o8 states, \"In the event of a suicide, institution staff,\nparticularly Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same\nlevel of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred.\" This policy further states, \"All possible\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025124.jpg": "Page 762\nevidence and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent investigators doing a\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>.\"\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic concern. For example, there\nwere two concurrently open atorney log books in the Atorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the\ntwo atorney log books, one in the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>, some of the log books\ncould not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not\nconsistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled,\nlog book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been tom off of several books. At the\ncurrent time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.\nInstitution Response: 9. Atorney Log Books:\nOn August lo, 2ol9, log books deemed relevant to the investigation were removed from various locations\nthroughout the facility. The <span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> Team did identify pertinent logbooks that had not been secured. At this\ntime, all relevant logbooks have been removed and replaced. In addition, a logbook audit was conducted to ensure\naccuracy of the documentation and compliance with policy. Measures are being taken to ensure in the future that all\nrelevant logbooks are identified, secured immediately and replaced with new ones to ensure the institution can\ncontinue to run efficiently.\nlo. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution revealed that the list used for\naccountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and incomplete.\nInstitution Response: lo: Automatic External Defibrillators:\nA review of the Automatic External Defibrillators (AED) report presented by Great Lakes Biomedical Services\ndated July 22, 2ol9, revealed that all AEDS were accounted for and were placed in the correct respective areas. The\nreport was accurate and complete. New AEDs have been purchased and will be inspected Great Lakes Biomedical\nServices upon their arrival. The list reviewed by the <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> team was an old and outdated list from January 8, °\n2ol8.\nMedical staff provides training and conducts monthly inspections of all AEDs in the institution. Great Lakes\nBiomedical Services, an outside contractor, conducts a bi-annual inspection and provides a report. Procedures on\ninspecting all AEDS in the institution have been prepared and are awaiting approval. These procedures are atached\nhereto.\nll.

If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter. A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training.

In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.

This\n<span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\n\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\n\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,\na private school on the Upper East Side of Manhatan from September l974 until he was\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo252l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025230.jpg": "Page 986\nInmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required\nby P55oo.l4, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.\n\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein’s death.\nSpecifically, three Atorney Log Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby\nareas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Atorney Visiting area were not\nsecured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> and after the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span> team advised staff to secure them. P5324.o8 states, “In the event of a\nsuicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law\nenforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime\nscene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence\nand documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent\ninvestigators doing a psychological <span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>.”\n\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic\nconcern. For example, there were two concurrently open atorney log books in the\nAtorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two atorney log books, one\nin the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reconstruction</span>, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,\nentries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not consistently sign in and\nout, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently\nlabeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been\ntorn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an\nadequate system of control and monitoring.\n\nlo. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution\nrevealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and\nincomplete.\n\nll.

The BOP will assess\nany additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed.\nThe factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors\ninclude an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a\nplan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.\nPublic Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(2o2) 3532o \"|\npate ——hvanenrs ll:39 AM >>>\nThe USA Today's top reporter (who's writen front page stories on the BOP) is asking if BOP is \"designating\nspecific officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations\nwhere inmates are at some risk for suicide.\"\nDOJ-OGR-ooo26o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027282.jpg": "(FS \\ U.S. Department of Justice\nNj Federal Bureau of Prisons\nReentry Services Division\nWashington, DC 2o534\nFy\nSEP 4 ¢ 2ol9\nMEMORANDUM FOR J.

According to the Psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">Reconstruction</span> conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479"};
