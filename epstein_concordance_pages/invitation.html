Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential\nleniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo767", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001039.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page98 of 2oo 35\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl relative of the defendant and the other appears to be a close\n\n2 associate.\n\n3 Despite having put millions of dollars into this\n\n4 trust, your Honor, and despite its assets being controlled by a\niy relative and close associate, the defendant mentions it not\n\n6 once in her motion before the court or in her Pretrial Services\n7 interview; and, in fact, despite the fact that the government\n\n8 said in its opening brief that the defendant's finances and her\n9 uncertain amount of wealth, including issues about whether her\nlo wealth was stored abroad, are serious concerns with respect to\nll the defendant's risk of flight, the defendant's opposition does\nl2 not discuss this at all.

The Defendant Has Failed to Establish That the Government Delayed the\nIndictment for An Improper Purpose\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay.*® See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong.”). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.’” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\nl6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides ample information about the\ncharged crimes and the victims referenced in the Indictment. Additionally, many of the\ndefendant’s requests fall within the scope of the Government’s Giglio and Jencks Act obligations,\nwhich the Government intends to produce at the appropriate stage in the litigation, well in advance\nof trial.\n°° The defendant invites the Court to engage in a balancing test that weighs the prejudice to the\ndefendant against the Government’s reasons for delay. (Def. Mot. 7 at 5,6 n.4). This Court should\nreject the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span>. The defendant cites United States v. Brand, 556 F.2d l3l2, l3l7\nn.7 (Sth Cir. l977), for the proposition that a shouing of prejudice triggers such balancing. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 5). Houever, the Fifth Circuit subsequently rejected such a balancing test, finding that\nthe “Brand footnote is pure dicta” and instead requiring that defendants demonstrate that the\nprosecution intentionally caused the delay to gain a tactical advantage over the defendant or “for\nsome other bad faith purpose.” United States v. Crouch, 84 F.3d l497, l5o9, l5l2 (Sth Cir. l996).\nThe defendant also cites that several Circuit courts, namely the Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth\nCircuits, require such a balancing test. (Def. Mot. 7 at 6n.4). The Second Circuit, houever, “has\nnot adopted any balancing test, as the Fourth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits have, and its\nJurisprudence suggests that it would not do so.” United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n49o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). Several other Circuits have also “refused to adopt a balancing test.” Jd.\n(collecting cases).

As such, because the\ndefendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of shouing both actual prejudice and unjustifiable\nGovernment conduct, her motion to dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay should be\ndenied.”\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motions to Suppress\n\nThe defendant moves to suppress evidence the Government obtained pursuant to a grand\njury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller and to dismiss Counts Five and Six under the Due Process\nClause, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell v.

In\nparticular, the defendant contends that the Government violated the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and misled Chief Judge McMahon in obtaining the modification of a protective order.\nShe also contends the subpoena was overly broad and amounted to an unlawful search of materials\nin which she had a reasonable expectation of privacy, as well as an infringement of her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.

Mot. 7 at l). As noted above and discussed further in\nSection X, infra, the Government has complied with its Rule l6 obligations and will produce\nGiglio and Jencks Act materials well in advance of trial. The Court should reject the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span> to defer ruling on this motion. See, e.g., United States v.

See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d at\nl224 (remanding for findings “on whether the protective order was improvidently granted or\nwhether the government had made a shouing of exceptional circumstances or a compelling need’’);\nPalmieri, 779 F.2d at 862 (reversing district court’s modification of protective orders where district\ncourt did not make an “express finding” of improvidence, extraordinary circumstances, or\ncompelling need and “remand|[ing] for further proceedings consistent with this opinion”).\n\n37 Maxwell asks this Court to review and reverse Chief Judge McMahon’s exercise of her\ndiscretion in modifying the protective order, because she disagrees with Chief Judge McMahon’s\nanalysis of the Martindell factors. Although Chief Judge McMahon’s order modifying the civil\nprotective order was not entered on the civil docket, that order, along with the Government’s\napplication and related materials, were produced to the defense on or about August l2, 2o2o. As\na result, Maxwell could have sought review of Chief Judge McMahon’s order in the Second\nCircuit. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). Maxwell asks this Court to second-guess a coequal district\ncourt’s decision to modify a protective order. Puting aside the question of whether this Court\neven has the authority to do so, it should in any event decline Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span> to act as a\nreviewing court to Chief Judge McMahon’s decision, which was made in her “sound discretion.”\nInre “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l47.\n\n38 To the extent that Maxwell seeks suppression of documents created prior to the entry of the\nprotective order (or created after its entry but not subject to its protections), that aspect of her\nmotion should be denied. A significant amount of the materials provided in response to the\nsubpoena included such pre-existing documents not created in reliance on a protective order, which\ndo not trigger the Martindell presumption in the Second Circuit, see TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at\n234-235; Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. Maxwell’s arguments also do not extend to transcripts of other\nindividuals’ depositions, who were not parties to the protective order.\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o42", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 239\n\n“The government bears the burden of proving inevitable discovery by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citing Nix, 467 U.S. at 444).

(quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span> to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 239\n“While the Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses . . . it defines the\nbasic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment.’”\nCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 49l U.S. 6l7, 633 (l989) (citations omited). “The\nright of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity\nto defend against the State’s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and\nto call witnesses in one's oun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”\nChambers v. Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation. Similarly,\nbecause there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence\nobtained pursuant to the subpoena.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThere is nothing surprising about the government’s opposition to limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire and individual sequestered voir dire. (Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating procedure: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed questionnaire seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span> to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and impartial jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury selection eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or motivated to serve for reasons beyond being fair and impartial.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\nsupervisory pouers and discretion and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

Testifying as to specific suggestive activities\nwould also likely violate the rule against expert testimony on specific witnesses’ credibility.\nNimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398.\n\nBut in its response brief, the Defense states that “[l]ike Dr. Rocchio, [Dr. Loftus] would\nbe testifying as a ‘blind’ expert” and so will not testify about any particular witness in this case.\nDef. Br. at l7. Based on this representation, the Court will admit Dr. Loftus’s opinion on the\ngeneral concepts of suggestive activities and false memory creation. The Defense may on cross-\nexamination ask witnesses about activities or events that the Defense believes led to false\nmemories. And the jury may then determine whether the general concepts in Dr. Loftus’s\nopinions are applicable to the evidence before it.\n\nLast, the Court clarifies that this decision as to Dr. Loftus is by no means an <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span> for\nmemory experts to be admited in every future case. As other federal courts have observed,\nexpert testimony of this type is relevant only in unusual circumstances. See Carter, 4lo F.3d at\n95o; United States v. Redwood, 2l6 F. Supp. 3d 89o, 899 (N.D.

The Court finds this case to be one such unusual\ncircumstance, both because of the long period of time that has elapsed since the charged conduct\nand because of the public atention that conduct has received.

Accordingly, the Court should deny the\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a conjunctive two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to\nanswer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The defendant cannot satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test.\n\nA. The Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate Falsehood\n\nAs set forth in the Government’s opposition to the Defense Motion, to satisfy the first\nprong, the defendant must demonstrate that the juror commited a deliberate falsehood, not an\nhonest mistake.! (Dkt. No. 643 at ll, l3-l5). There is no evidence in the record that Juror 5o\n' In her reply brief (Dkt. No. 644 at l2-l4), the defendant asks the Court to ignore the Second\nCircuit’s binding, on-point decision in United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll (2d Cir. l994), which\nrequires deliberateness. The Court should reject this <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span>.\nThe defendant asserts that Shaoul’s holding that “a defendant must shou . . . that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer,” id. at 8l6, is dicta, claiming that Shaoul was decided on the second prong of\nthe McDonough test. (Dkt. No. 644 at l2). Not so. In Shaoul, the Circuit expressly affirmed the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the defendant “had failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of the\nMcDonough test,” before concluding that he “also cannot satisfy the second part.” /d.; see, e.g.,\nPyet v. Pa. Bldg. Co., 498 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“Our conclusion . . . was an alternative\nholding, not dicta, and continues to bind our Court.”), rev'd on other grounds sub nom., l4 Penn\nPlaza LLC v. Pyet, 56 U.S. 247 (2oo9). This holding stands in stark contrast to the passing\nstatements made in later cases the defendant cites, which did not consider whether the first prong\nrequires deliberateness, much less reject Shaoul. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3-\nOo5 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (explaining that only two “alleged intentional omissions” justified further\ninquiry, but even if proved, neither would have satisfied the second prong); United States v. Greer,\n285 F.3d l58, l7o (2d Cir. 2oo2) (finding it “unnecessary to determine whether, under\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo294", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” Jd. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span> to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo356", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2l of 45\nencouraged her to massage Epstein’s feet, and that the Defendant then gave her a massage during\nwhich the Defendant touched Annie’s breasts. /d. at 2o83-86. As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00011854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 82 of 247 2lo\nLBUCmax3 Visoski - cross\n\nl Q.

Carolyn, for\n\n7 instance, was invited to travel by the defendant. The jury can\n8 readily find that that <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span> to travel included an\n\n9 <span class=\"highlight\">invitation</span> to New York, where the abuse would continue, as it\nlo did for Jane.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant.

Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIll. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021250.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OG 3536o38, Page/8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia.
