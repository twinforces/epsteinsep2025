(Schulte Br, at 2l—\n22; Schulte Reply at l3-l4.) The Court is unpersuaded. As to the former contention, Schulte\ndoes not explain hou the alleged proration error constitutes a “substantial” violation of the JSSA, |\nespecially where its “effect” appears to be “minimal.” Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *ll (rejecting\nthe same argument on the basis that it was merely a “technical violation of the ISSA”).

The Court merely invited a discrete response to its proposed address to\nprospective jury but the government seized the opportunity to reargue.\n\nDuring the October 2l conference, the defense stated its reasons for preferring November 29, a\ndate when the Court could inquire whether any prospective jury might not be able to be fair or otherwise\nimpacted or influenced by any reference to this case during the lo-day interval that included the\nThanksgiving holiday. Further, it would eliminate the need to substitute alternates in the event any juror\nwas exposed to COVID or otherwise became ill. If last year was any indication, Thanksgiving week is a\nlikely time for COVID to spike due to high-volume travel, students returning home from college, and\nfriends and families congregating. Even an exposure to the virus during the holidays can necessitate a\nprospective juror to quarantine for a time period past November 29.\n\nDuring the conference, the government pressed for November l9 because it wanted a have a firm\nstart date for witnesses coming from out of state. November 29 is the firm start date and openings will\ncommence follouing exercise of challenges and the swearing in of the jury.

Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial.

His juror number, which is listed on the sheet, was among the l8 chosen as\njurors or alternates.\n\nMaxwell's defense lawyers argued that the women's memories had been corrupted over the\nyears and that they were motivated by money to implicate Maxwell.\n\nScoty David said several jurors initially were not sure whether to convict Maxwell on the sex\ntrafficking count, which is backed up by the testimony of a woman named Carolyn who said she\nwas l4 when Epstein began abusing her in 2oo2.\n\nBut he said some jurors changed their minds after hearing the personal story of one juror who\nsaid she grew up poor. Carolyn said she dropped out of school in seventh grade and was paid\n$3oo - sometimes by Maxwell - each time she gave Epstein an erotic massage.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of <span class=\"highlight\">alternate</span> cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch.
