Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\narmed private guards atempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—trather than the\ndefendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the\ndefendant’s flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y.\n2ol9). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in\nfacilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities.” /d. at 258 (citing Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d at 74 n.l3 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force\nmay need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ... [s}uch a conclusion would, in fact,\ndemand a defendant's detention’”)).\n\nThe Second Circuit has held it is not legal error “for a district court to decline to accept,”\nas “a substitute for detention,” a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him. United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, l36 F. Supp. 2d l25, l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool))); Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would\nsuggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has\na statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location.”).\n\nThe defendant’s payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having\nthe defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding\nhim, leaving the company’s incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an <span class=\"highlight\">unauthorized</span> visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v. Tajideen, l7 Cr. o46, 2ol8\nWL l342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. l5, 2ol8) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further\nnoting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's\nsecurity detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's\njurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the pouer of money and its potential to corrupt or\nundermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 (“although this Defendant has vast\nfinancial resources to construct his oun ‘private prison,’ the Court is not convinced ‘disparate\ntreatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act’”) (quoting United States v.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo337", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000459.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 25-2 Filed o7/l7/l9 Page2of8\nFrom: Jeffrey Epstein Ii\nSubject:\nDate: July 25, 2ol2 at 2:54 PM\nTo: Deborah Anaya\nCe: Darren Indyke\nDETECTIVE, | WILL BE STAYING IN SANTA FE, FOR APPROX THREE WEEKS STARTING NEXT MONDAY THE 3o.
