Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 6\ncontained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000638.jpg": "os Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document52~ Filed o8/29/l9 Page 2 of 2\nCase l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 47-4 Filed o8/l9/l9 Page 2 of 2\n5, Accomdingly, I regommend thak an order of nolle\nprosequi be filed ag to defendant JEFFREY EPSTEIN,\nDated: New York, New York\n.

In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\n<span class=\"highlight\">significance</span>—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v.

The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec.

(Def. Mot. 7 at l2-l4). Once again, this\nargument is entirely speculative. The defendant hypothesizes that if she had access to certain\ndocumentary evidence (some of which, such as travel records, has been produced in discovery),\nor evidence which she herself should have access to (e.g., her oun emails from l994 to l997, her\noun phone records from l994 to l997, and her oun travel records from l994 to l997), this\nevidence would have helped her.

Even if such records were helpful, dismissal of the Indictment would be too\nextreme a measure in light of the relative <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of this form of evidence to other proof in\nthe case. Thus, the defendant’s claim that she no longer has access to certain evidence is not a\nproper basis to dismiss the Indictment. See United States v. Dornau, 356 F.

Background\n\nl. The SDNY and Local Rules for the Division of Business\n\nThe defendant’s brief repeatedly uses the term “Division” to describe a “White Plains\nDivision” and a “Manhatan Division.” (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 9 at 2 (“On June 29, 2o2o, the\ngovernment filed a sealed indictment of Ms. Maxwell in the Manhatan Division of this Court. The\ngovernment has conceded that Ms. Maxwell’s indictment was obtained using a grand jury seated\nin White Plains, apparently with jurors drawn exclusively from the White Plains Division.”)). Her\nuse of the term “division” is imprecise and atributes legal <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> where there is none.\nUnderstanding hou that is so requires some background.\n\nDistrict courts in each state in the United States are prescribed by statute. United States\ndistrict courts in New York State are divided between four districts: Northern, Southern, Eastern\nand Western. 28 U.S.C. § ll2. While certain districts in other states are further divided into\n“divisions” by statute, see, e.g., id. § 8l (dividing Alabama into three “districts” and multiple\n“divisions” within each district), the federal districts in New York State are not so divided. That\nis, in the Southern District, no “divisions” have been created by statute. /d. § ll2(b). The statute\nprovides only that “Court for the Southern District shall be held at New York, White Plains, and\nin the Middletoun-Wallkill area of Orange County or such nearby location as may be deemed\nappropriate.” Id.\n\nIn the Southern District, the only authority determining whether particular cases are heard\nin the Manhatan or White Plains courthouse is the SDNY Business Division Rules. These rules\nbegin with an important preface: they “shall not be deemed to vest any rights in litigants... .”\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

FEBRUARY — JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'® Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span>, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing.

I agree that [the\nCVRA| applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

[and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”>°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent.

The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l2 of 34\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of those interactions and of AUSA J misrepresentations to an Article\nIII federal judge.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®” Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span>, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l82 of 349\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l88 of 349\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 26\n\n(2d Cir. 2ool) (prosecution must produce Giglio material “in time for its effective use at trial”).\nImpeachment material simply does not warrant immediate disclosure.

Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 43 of 8o\nagreed with the trial court’s statement that the <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of the age of a prior bad act is\n“inversely proportional” to the similarity between the prior bad act and the facts underlying\nthe charged offense. /d. (quoting Commonwealth v. Aikens, 99o A.2d ll8l, ll85 (Pa.\nSuper. 2olo)). Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the\nevents in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by the trial court to conclude\nthat “the at-issue time gap is relatively inconsequential.” /d. “Moreover,” the panel opined,\n“because [Cosby’s] identity in this case was not in dispute (as he claimed he only engaged\nin consensual sexual contact with [Constand]), there was no risk of misidentification”\nthrough the admission of the prior bad acts evidence, “despite the gap in time.” /d.\n\nAdditionally, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s contention that the trial court had\nfailed to weigh adequately the prejudicial impact of the prior bad acts evidence. The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were sufficient to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with Cosby’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected Cosby’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Cosby’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o. The court credited the Commonwealth’s\nargument that Cosby’s familiarity with Qualudes was suggestive of his mens rea,\ninasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances knoun to him for purposes of\ndetermining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated\nindecent assault—recklessness.” /d. (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)(2)).

There has been considerable debate over the\nlegal <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of District Atorney Castor’s publicly announced decision not to\nprosecute Cosby in 2oo5. Before the trial court, the Superior Court, and nou this Court,\nthe parties have vigorously disputed whether D.A. Castor and Cosby reached a binding\nagreement, whether D.A. Castor extended an enforceable promise, or whether any act of\nlegal <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> occurred at all. There is testimony in the record that could support any\nof these conclusions. The trial court—the entity charged with sorting through those\nfacts—found that D.A. Castor made no agreement or overt promise.\n\nMuch of that debate, and the atendant factual conclusions, were based upon the\napparent absence of a formal agreement and former D.A. Castor’s various efforts to\ndefend and explain his actions ten years after the fact. As a reviewing court, we accept\nthe trial court’s conclusion that the district atorney's decision was merely an exercise of\nhis charging discretion.24 As we assess whether that decision, and the surrounding\nmA The dissent agrees—as do we —with the trial court’s conclusion that D.A. Castor’s\ndecision not to prosecute was, at its core, an exercise of the inherent charging discretion\nvested in district atorneys. See D.O. at l. But the dissent would simply end the analysis\nthere. In the dissent’s view, once a decision is deemed to fall within a prosecutor’s\ndiscretion, that decision “in no way” can bind the actions of future elected prosecutors.\nRespectfully, this perspective overlooks the verity that not all decisions are the same. As\nto routine discretionary decisions, the dissent may be correct. But as we explain\nthroughout this opinion, what occurred here was anything but routine. Here, D.A. Castor’s\nexercise of discretion was made deliberately to induce the deprivation of a fundamental\nright. The typical decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute, is not made for the purpose\nof extracting incriminating information from a suspect when there exists no other\nmechanism to do so.\n\nThe dissent would amalgamate and confine all “present exercise[s] of prosecutorial\ndiscretion” within a single, non-binding, unenforceable, and unreviewable category. /d.\nWe decline to endorse this blanket approach, as such decisions merit, and indeed require,\nindividualized evaluation. To rule otherwise would authorize, if not encourage,\nprosecutors to choose temporarily not to prosecute, obtain incriminating evidence from\nthe suspect, and then reverse course with impunity. Due process necessarily requires\nthat court officials, particularly prosecutors, be held to a higher standard. This is\nparticularly so in circumstances where the prosecutor’s decision is crafted specifically to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 69\n\nAccordingly, the Florida Investigation will already be a central part of the case presented\nto the jury. It will not be confusing or distracting to elicit evidence of hou that investigation\nconcluded, as the government contends. See Mot. at 27. In fact, the opposite is true. Without\nthat evidence, the jury will be left to speculate hou and when the Florida Investigation ended,\nand whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the circumstances\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,\ngiven that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of hou\nthe U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the resolution\nof the investigation.

(Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose reliability the defense does not challenge.

For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc.

The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974).

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\nlaboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v. Randall, l9-Cr.-l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335.\n\nFor the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—\nthe Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability\nof Dr. Rocchio’s method.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method\nis unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006456.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 69\n\nAccordingly, the Florida Investigation will already be a central part of the case presented\nto the jury. It will not be confusing or distracting to elicit evidence of hou that investigation\nconcluded, as the government contends. See Mot. at 27. In fact, the opposite is true. Without\nthat evidence, the jury will be left to speculate hou and when the Florida Investigation ended,\nand whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the circumstances\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,\ngiven that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of hou\nthe U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the resolution\nof the investigation. OPR Report at 284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by puting the\nNPA at issue in the trial is therefore illusory. It should not be excluded under Rule 4o3.7°\n° The NPA is also not hearsay.

(Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the <span class=\"highlight\">Significance</span> of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def.

So different\nl8 studies use different measures. There are other studies that\nl9 looked at inter-rater reliability. In other words, if someone\n2o is coding the content of a qualitative interview that's been\n2l done, they'll look at the degree of agreement and of course\n22 potential disagreement, which would be error, in differences of\n23 opinion, and atempt to address and resolve those.\n24 But, as I had indicated earlier, in this field, a pure\n25 error rate, as in many areas of the social sciences, cannot be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 6 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 5\nhindsight, labeled “grooming” or otherwise imputed as knouledge to onlookers. Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous.

Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia Giuffre’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my consideration, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span>, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A.

But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l).

(quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution nou.

The Court, houever, assigns limited weight to\nthis factor because Maxwell, who does not have a legal right to access the grand jury materials,\nhas not seen it. Her opposition is therefore fairly viewed as precautionary. Had Maxwell been\naware that the grand jury materials are duplicative of information in the public record, her\nposition might have been different.\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThis factor addresses the present-day <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of the grand jury materials at issue and\nwhether their disclosure would advance the public interest. This factor so decisively weighs\nagainst unsealing that it alone would require denying the Government’s motion.\n\nArguments to disclose grand jury testimony on account of historical or public interest are\n“totally appropriate” and sometimes may even be weighty. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But for\nthe reasons reviewed above, the grand jury materials here are neither of historical nor public-\ninterest importance.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”\"'?

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\nIX. FEBRUARY - JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.!©? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nto On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillatfafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span>, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021355.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ABT 3536o38, Pagel83 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE, The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl, The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021361.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel89 of 258\nSA-l87\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\n\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”3”? Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6).

Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family\nof the victim must be consulted by the state atorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the\ndisposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.

[and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”3°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point Ijust felt... like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --.. .\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement.

The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\nad Villafafia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its <span class=\"highlight\">significance</span> to their oun cases.*””\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024176.jpg": "BP-AoAAS ie .\n_ JUN lo my = \"US.
