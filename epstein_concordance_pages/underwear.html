Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the <span class=\"highlight\">underwear</span> he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her <span class=\"highlight\">underwear</span> as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge pom is\nmen with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the <span class=\"highlight\">underwear</span> he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her <span class=\"highlight\">underwear</span> as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge porn is\nmen with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\nHis claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like\nyoung women.’ ~ '\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their <span class=\"highlight\">underwear</span>, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o5l"};
