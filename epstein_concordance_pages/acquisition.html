Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.

Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one.

So, typically, we start with the first stage, which is\n22 called the <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> stage. This is kind of -- and this is a\n23 period where some event or events occur. That's the first\n24 stage of the process.\n25 But after that event or those events are over, nou\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool398o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l22 of 246 24l7\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl time is passing and we enter the second stage, and this is\n\n2 called the retention stage. After some time has passed, a\n\n3 person might be asked to remember the event or the events, to\n\n4 answer questions, to subject himself to an interview, to\n\n5 testify. These are acts of retrieval where somebody is trying\n6 to retrieve information about the event.\n\n7 And so nou we enter that third stage, which is the\n\n8 retrieval stage. So our job as researches in this field is to\n9 identify the psychological factors that come into play at each\nlo of these three stages that can affect the accuracy of what\n\nll somebody is telling you.\n\nl2 Q. Let me stop you for a second. When you were referring to\nl3 the <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> stage, you mentioned an event. In the category\nl4 of event, is it just something that one sees or can it be that\nl5 something that one actually personally experiences or hears?\n\nl6 A. Well, first of all, it could be just -- it could be what\n\nl7 somebody sees and hears. It can be a robbery, for example,\n\nl8 which somebody is seeing something and maybe hearing some\n\nl9 conversation, but it might just be memory from a conversation\n2o or memory for some other experience that ends up being critical\n2l where you would like to knou what happened.\n22 Q. So one could actually be an observer or an actual\n23 participant or a hearer, someone who hears something in that\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> stage?\n25 A. Yes. Sometimes people, for example, are crime victims and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool398l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l23 of 246 24l8\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl sometimes they're witnesses, and they're not the victim\n\n2 themselves, but -—-\n\n3 Q. Nou, after the <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> stage, is anything that happens\n4 after the event, whichever constitutes the event occurs,\n\na considered retention stage?\n\n6 A. Typically, yes. It's after the event is over, so we say,\n7 well, that's the retention stage. I don't mean to complicate\n8 things too much, but I think you can appreciate that actually\n9 there can be many acts of retrieval. So there can be a long\nlo retention interval peppered with different acts of retrieval.\nll But I used a simple diagram here to illustrate the three major\nl2 stages.\n\nl3 Q. Can you simply identify what separate acts of retrieval\n\nl4 would be.\n\nl5 A. So after some event, say, you knou, a robbery, sometimes\nl6 people might have a conversation with each other about what\n\nl7 they saw and then sometimes the police might come to the scene\nl8 and start asking questions about what did you see or what did\nl9 you hear, and then the person might go to a police station and\n2o maybe try to make an identification of somebody who might have\n2l been seen at the event, and then somebody may be interviewed\n22 many more times, may then testify at trial. That would be a\n23 standard situation in a legally relevant event.\n24 Q. Nou, in each of those retrieval examples you just gave,\n25 that is coming from an external source; correct?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l24 of 246 24l9\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl A. Yes.\n\n2 Q. Is there the possibility of retrieval from an internal\n\n3 source, meaning within the individual who is trying to recreate\n4 the memory?\n\n5 A. Well, in the example that I gave earlier with the stop sign\n6 and the yield sign, we do suggest the misinformation\n\n7 externally, we supply them with the misinformation. But\n\n8 sometimes what happens with individuals is they draw inferences\n9 about what might have happened or what could have happened or\nlo what possibly happened and they can suggest things to\n\nll themselves. That's called autosuggestion where there is not\n\nl2 somebody deliberately suggesting something to you, not\n\nl3 deliberately trying to tell you, you knou, I saw the thief and\nl4 he was wearing a broun jacket instead of a green jacket, but\n\nl5 you, the witness, are drawing inferences that then start to\n\nl6 feel as if they're memories.\n\nl7 Q. Going back to the <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> stage, what would affect the\nl8 quality of one's <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> of an event?\n\nl9 A. At the time of <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span>, the event itself, well, some\n2o obvious thing, hou good is the lighting, hou far away are you,\n2l hou distracted are you, are you preoccupied thinking about\n22 something else. Sometimes, if you're under the influence of\n23 certain drugs. Marijuana is one that has been studied a lot,\n24 for example, and we've studied it in a recent paper. That\n25 could affect the formation of the memory in the first place.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l25 of 246 242o\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl Q. So in connection with the <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> stage, there could be\n2 external factors that can affect <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span>?\n\n3 A. Yes.\n\n4 Q. And there could also be personal or internal factors that\n\n5 could affect one's <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> of information?\n\n6 A. Yes.\n\n7 Q. Nou, going to the retrieval stage --\n\n8 A. Retention.\n\n9 QO. Well, retention would be --\n\nlo A. What would be next.\n\nll Q. What you hold from the experience; correct?\n\nl2 A. Well -- so, time is passing. I mean, the event is geting\nl3 older and older, and some other things are important in this\n\nl4 retention stage, and one of those things is whether or not a\n\nl5 person is exposed to post-event suggestion. If there is\n\nl6 post-event suggestion, maybe a litle misinformation, it can\n\nl7 enter a witness's memory and cause a contamination, an\n\nl8 alteration, a distortion, or even a supplementation of memory,\nl9 and the longer that retention interval, the older -- the older\n2o the event is, the more susceptible people are to having\n2l post-event suggestion potentially contaminate their memory.\n22 Q. It's fair to say that one does not need any degree\n23 whatsoever to knou that memory can fade over time; correct?\n24 A. Correct -- I think, yeah, that's kind of a mater of common\n25 sense. But what's less a mater of common sense is that, as\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l46 of 257 298o\nLCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl We knou that the accusers talked to their lawyers; we\n2 knou that many talked to the media; we knou that they saw the\n\n3 media; we knou that they talked to other accusers; we knou that\n4 they all had at least a plan of recovering money through their\na lawsuits and the victims' compensation fund, and that works on\n6 your memories.\n\n7 She told you about the three different stages of\n\n8 memories, and that one thing that can happen is what's called\n\n9 autosuggestion. Basically, when people suggest things to\n\nlo themselves, and then they start to remember things and they\n\nll start to draw inferences, and then they start to feel as if\n\nl2 those things are actual memories.

And post-event information can impact a memory\nl5 at any one of those stages.\n\nl6 If you're under the influence of drugs or alcohol at\nl7 the time you acquire the memory, that affects the quality of\n\nl8 the formation of the memory in the first place. The older a\n\nl9 memory gets, the more susceptible it is to post-event\n2o information. A litle bit can come in, the older the memory\n2l is, and it can cause a contamination or a distortion or a\n22 supplementation. And news media in whatever form can include\n23 re-dramatization.\n24 Sometimes there's pressure to provide more and more\n25 details about some particular subject. I don't knou.

If there is\n\nl6 post-event suggestion, maybe a litle misinformation, it can\n\nl7 enter a witness's memory and cause a contamination, an\n\nl8 alteration, a distortion, or even a supplementation of memory,\nl9 and the longer that retention interval, the older -- the older\n2o the event is, the more susceptible people are to having\n2l post-event suggestion potentially contaminate their memory.\n22 Q. It's fair to say that one does not need any degree\n23 whatsoever to knou that memory can fade over time; correct?\n24 A. Correct -- I think, yeah, that's kind of a mater of common\n25 sense. But what's less a mater of common sense is that, as\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool66o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l46 of 257 298o\nLCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl We knou that the accusers talked to their lawyers; we\n2 knou that many talked to the media; we knou that they saw the\n\n3 media; we knou that they talked to other accusers; we knou that\n4 they all had at least a plan of recovering money through their\na lawsuits and the victims' compensation fund, and that works on\n6 your memories.\n\n7 She told you about the three different stages of\n\n8 memories, and that one thing that can happen is what's called\n\n9 autosuggestion. Basically, when people suggest things to\n\nlo themselves, and then they start to remember things and they\n\nll start to draw inferences, and then they start to feel as if\n\nl2 those things are actual memories. But memories come from the\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">acquisition</span> of the event, the retention of the information, and\nl4 the retrieval. And post-event information can impact a memory\nl5 at any one of those stages.\n\nl6 If you're under the influence of drugs or alcohol at\nl7 the time you acquire the memory, that affects the quality of\n\nl8 the formation of the memory in the first place. The older a\n\nl9 memory gets, the more susceptible it is to post-event\n2o information. A litle bit can come in, the older the memory\n2l is, and it can cause a contamination or a distortion or a\n22 supplementation. And news media in whatever form can include\n23 re-dramatization.\n24 Sometimes there's pressure to provide more and more\n25 details about some particular subject. I don't knou.
