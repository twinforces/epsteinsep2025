The government’s Brief in <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span>\nonly underscores the importance of this question.\n\nMost significantly, the government concedes a\ncircuit split on this issue, effectively admiting that\ndefendants’ rights hinge on the happenstance of\ngeography. Opp.l3. Such an acknouledged conflict\namong the circuits demands this Court’s intervention.\n\nRather than grapple with the core principles of plea\nagreements, the government tries to distract by\nreciting a lurid and irrelevant account of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s misconduct. But this case is about what the\ngovernment promised, not what Epstein did.\n\nEven more remarkably, the government advances an\ninterpretation of its non-prosecution agreement that\nflips its plain meaning on its head. Promising “not to\nprosecute” somehou meant preserving the right to\nprosecute. That is not contract interpretation; it is\nalchemy. Plea agreements are supposed to be strictly\nconstrued against the government, yet here the\ngovernment isn’t even asking for the benefit of the\ndoubt; it is asking for a blank check to rewrite its oun\npromise after the fact. The government’s only real\nargument is that the Second Circuit rule is correct on\nthe merits while the other circuits have it wrong. We\nobviously disagree, but regardless, the Court should\ngrant certiorari so that all circuits employ that same rule.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo245", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000248.jpg": "4\n\nwhat parties mean when they use the term “the\n\nUnited States” without further qualification.\n\nII. The Second Circuit’s decision belou is wrong\nand violates the principles set forth in this\nCourt’s prior opinions.\n\nIn atempting to defend the Second Circuit’s out-\ncome, the government advances a series of contentions\nabout the Epstein NPA’s scope, the U.S. Atorney’s\nauthority, contract law doctrines, and canons of con-\nstruction. Each lacks merit.\n\nAs the government acknouledges, Opp.8, the start-\ning point in any contract is the text. Here, the text\ncould not be more clear. In exchange for Epstein’s\nguilty plea and other penalties and concessions,\n“the United States also agrees that it will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential\nco-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited\nto [four names].” (emphasis added).\n\nThis promise is unqualified. It is not geographically\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida, it is not\nconditioned on the co-conspirators being knoun by the\ngovernment at the time, it does not depend on what\nany particular government atorney may have had in\nhis or her head about who might be a co-conspirator,\nand it contains no other caveat or exception. This\nshould be the end of the discussion. See Santobello v.\nNew York, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l) “[W]hen a plea rests in\nany significant degree on a promise or agreement of\nthe prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the\ninducement or consideration, such promise must be\nfulfilled.”) Ggnored by the government in its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>).\n\nThe government seeks to evade this straightforward\nlanguage by focusing on other clauses in the NPA and\non extrinsic context, Opp.8-lo, but its efforts only\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo248", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000283.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lo of l6\n\nTo reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “/east restrictive”\nconditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)\n(emphasis added). Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial.

Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

Discussion\n\nA. The In re Craig Factors\n\nThe Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors\nand any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. Jn re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can\ngovernment <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> preclude it.”). While the Government acknouledges the extraordinary\n* See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at\nFederal Prison - United States House Commitee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense\npublic interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the ll9th Congress, on February ll, 2o25, the\nCommitee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a leter to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession\nregarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.” On May 8, the Task Force\nsent another leter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein\nfiles’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo749", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000750.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 5oflo\nnature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the\nunderlying proceedings.\n\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to public\ndisclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000781.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document l-2, o7/23/2ol9, 26l4667, Paged of 7\n\no7/o8/2ol9 Atorney update in case as to Jeffrey Epstein.

The United States Atorney's Office should email Chambers with\ninformation regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to l8 U.S.C.\n§377l(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will\nthen provide information as to the logistics for their dial-in access.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure. Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d\nlo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds\nthat the Governments submissions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process,” thereby qualifying as a \"judicial\ndocument\" for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v.\nAmodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And the Court also finds that\nthe common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner\nComme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation.

At the heart of this case are brave women\nwho are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to\nappreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as\nminors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from\nthese events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.\n\nThere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the\njurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.\nFor the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorandum, and as further discussed belou, the\ndefendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her\ncontinued appearance in this case. Among other concerns: (l) she is a citizen of a country that\ndoes not extradite its oun citizens; (2) she appears to have access to considerable wealth\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo986", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000991.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Dibeu tet 22o 2F il e@ OFAL8) 26a geageo’ 2o9\ncharges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from\n2ool to 2oo7, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations\nof statutes not charged in this Indictment.

The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001220.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Deke Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a Gea Geol l G5 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions.

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex.

No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI.

After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001246.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePage@ 4 l69\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool248", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001262.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd33ouAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3ie/2agPiagecs 66l8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool262", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001291.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye df d6i6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nNo. l7-CR-o2949-MV-l\n\nv.\n\nDASHAWN ROBERTSON,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nTHIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to\nReconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release.

This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool585", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 2 of l9\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nwenn nen ee eX\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- i 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nee eee ene EE\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S REPLY MEMORANDUM\nIN FURTHER SUPPORT OF DETENTION\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this reply memorandum in further support of its\nmotion for detention, dated July 2, 2o2o (the “Detention Memorandum”) (Dkt. 4), and in response\nto the defendant’s memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> Memorandum’) (Dkt. l8).\n\nThe charges against Ghislaine Maxwell arise from her essential role in sexual exploitation\nthat caused deep and lasting harm to vulnerable victims. At the heart of this case are brave women\nwho are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to\nappreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as\nminors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from\nthese events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.\n\nThere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the\njurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.\nFor the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorandum, and as further discussed belou, the\ndefendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her\ncontinued appearance in this case. Among other concerns: (l) she is a citizen of a country that\ndoes not extradite its oun citizens; (2) she appears to have access to considerable wealth\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001617.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 7 of l9\ncharges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from\n2ool to 2oo7, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations\nof statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l5 of l9\nthan any other inmate at the MDC, and thus she cannot claim any greater need for bail than the\nmany inmates awaiting trial there.\n\nThe virus, of course, presents new and complex challenges for protecting inmates’ health,\nbut the BOP generally, and the MDC specifically, are prepared to handle the risks presented by\nCOVID-l9 and other health issues.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in further support of its request to delay\ndisclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding\nvictims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are\nnot exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government\nis not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully\nintends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it\nhas interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that\ninvestigation remains ongoing, houever, and because the Materials are unrelated to the charges\ncontained in the Indictment, production at this stage would be premature and would reveal the\nscope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that it be permited to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.\n\nFirst, Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> misconstrues the Government’s description of the Materials\nand conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue\nhere include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused\nduring time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness\nstatements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the\nGovernment will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus\ndo not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the\ndefendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed belou,\nwhether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that\npostdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.\n\nSecond, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not\nexculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> stretches the concept of exculpatory\nmaterial beyond recognition in a way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under\nthe defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after l997 without the\ndefendant’s involvement, that somehou exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her\nwith participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between l994 and l997.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request that the Court grant the\nGovernment permission to delay disclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents\nregarding victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n' Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the production of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial. Houever, Rule\nl6(d)(l) also provides that:\n\nAt any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer\n\ndiscovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief. The court\n\nmay permit a party to shou good cause by a writen statement that\n\nthe court will inspect ex parte.\nA finding of good cause “‘must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm,\nnot on conclusory statements.’” United States v.

No. 89. The Government did not file any <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the Defendant’s proposed\nredactions.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant’s proposed redactions. The\nCourt’s decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under\nthis test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial\ndocuments;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials;\nand (i) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o.\n“Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.”” /d. at\nl2o (quoting United States v.

The Court finds that Defendant’s leter motions\nare “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool97o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-ll Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3 of 3\nSo I am in a position to speak to Guislaine's character. | had goten to knou her vital personality quite\nwell when she was young. And even though | wasn't in direct touch with her later on, all these Maxwell\nchildren are quite “tight” - they've always stayed closely in touch with each other. Thus whenever I'd\nspeak to any of her elders — Philip, Anne, Isabel and Christine, I'd also hear reports not just about their\noun lives and activities, but also Kevin's and Ian's, as well about Ghislaine's life. Her siblings\nconsistently reported for about a decade that she was enjoying life while starting her oun charity.\nSo what kind of a character is Ghislaine? I can testify without the least doubt that she is mature,\nsensitive, thoughtful, honest and, like all her siblings, strong-willed, determined and quite obviously\ngrounded in good human values. She does not lie. She is no “chicken” - it would be totally unlike her\nto run away from the charges leveled against her by the Government. In fact, the idea of not “facing the\nmusic” is totally against the values of every single Maxwell, because both their parents always\nemphasized personal responsibility — specifically to face Bob's temper. These people consider running\naway their greatest shame. Furthermore, in facing their father's criticisms, they were trained, over and\nover, to defend themselves with real courage. So I have no doubt that not only did Ghislaine — despite\nthe blaring headlines in the press and the governments’ oun <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to bail alleging incorrectly that\nshe is a “flight risk” — made absolutely no atempt to leave the US at any time in 2ol9, but has stayed\nto fight the civil accusations against her starting earlier.

This Opinion is provided pursuant to instructions from Peters and Peters Solicitors LLP’ dated l2\nAugust 2o2o in the context of bail proceedings relating to Ms Ghislaine Maxwell before the United\nStates District Court, Southern District of New York. Subsequent instructions have confirmed that Ms\nMaxwell will execute a waiver of her right to extradition that could be exhibited to a future extradition\nrequest made by the United States and relied upon in any extradition proceedings. The specific\nquestions asked by Peters and Peters are atached at Annex A. A summary of counsel’s relevant\nexperience is atached at Annex B. The waiver is atached at Annex C.\n\n2. Insummary:\n\n(a) Extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom are governed by the Extradition Act 2oo3\n(‘the 2oo3 Act’) and, in general, comprise; (i) a hearing before a designated ‘appropriate\nJudge’ (the extradition hearing); and (i) an appeal, subject to a leave requirement.\n\n(b) In proceedings under the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may consent to their extradition\nwhich has the effect of removing the need for an extradition hearing and waiving the\nperson’s statutory appeal rights.\n\n(c) In the majority of cases, proceedings in England and Wales in relation to US extradition\nrequests are concluded in under two years’. The process is significantly shorter if the\nrequested person consents to their extradition and in those cases the timescales are\napproximately between one and three months.\n\n(d) It is extremely unlikely that bail would be granted in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United States\nprior to trial and in breach of bail.\n\n' The follouing documents were annexed to the instructions: (a) Superseding Indictment, United States v Ghislaine\nMaxwell, dated 8 July 2o2o; (b) a transcript of the arraignment and bail hearing that took place on l4 July 2o2o; (c) the\nMotion to Detain the Defendant dated 2 July 2o2o; (d) the Memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to the Motion for Detention dated\nlo July 2o2o; (e) and the Government Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention dated l3 July 2o2o.\n° There is no data as to the duration of extradition proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland but it may be inferred\nthat the timescales are similar.\nl922623.l\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o97", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l2 of 29\nthis as a weighty factor”. Second, a court would be likely to consider that the interests of the\nvictims’’ would be best served by a trial in the United States. The High Court has held that the\ninterests of victims” “will be in having a trial at a place where, if they do give evidence or wish to be\npresent, they can be so” ”. Third, Ms Maxwell’s connections to the UK*’ do not appear to be of a\ntype likely to be considered substantial in this context.\nMental and physical condition\n34. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to establish that her physical or mental condition\n\nis such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite her*'. In order to rely on her physical or\nmental health in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to extradition, Ms Maxwell would need to serve evidence sufficient to\nmeet the statutory test. Most cases in the ‘unjust’ category relate to the persons’ fitness to plead to\notherwise to participate in trial proceedings. Oppression is a high threshold, not easily surmountable*\nand stress and hardship, which occur in most extradition cases, are not sufficient®’. Even in cases\nwhere the requested person suffers from a serious medical conditions, it is often possible for the\nrequesting state gives an assurance as to the medical care that will be provided™, or an undertaking to\nreturn an individual if they are later found to be unfit to plead*, and thus ensure that extradition is\npossible notwithstanding the requested person’s medical problems.\n\n’® Love v United States [2ol8] l WLR 2889, para. 28.\n\n7” Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 83A(3)(a).\n\n8 Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 83A(3)(a).\n\n” Shaw v United States [2ol4] EWHC 4654 (Admin), paragraph 6l.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l98", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lol Filed l2/23/2o Page l of 2\nUSDC SDNY .\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/23/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions’). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2227", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page ll of 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. /d. at 83:2l—83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. /d. at\n84:4-84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

Similarly, it would create a substantial risk that the jury will confuse the legal and\nfactual issues pertinent to the Perjury Counts and convict Ms. Maxwell without independently\nconsidering those counts. See Ramos, 2oo9 WL l6l99l2, at *2 (severing “temporally distinct”\ndrug counts involving a different controlled substance from other drug counts because of “the\npotential for jury confusion, or improper propensity inferences, with respect to the drug-related\naspects of the original charges”).\n\nFurthermore, the government’s decision to allege violations only in the narrou l994-\nl997 time period was deliberate—it did so, in part, to try to avoid the impact of Epstein’s 2oo7\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”). In its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s initial bail\napplication, the government argued that the NPA did not protect Ms. Maxwell from prosecution\nprincipally because the Indictment did not charge conduct covered by the NPA, which the\ngovernment argues “was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7, a time\nperiod that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 22 at 5-6).? The\ngovernment nou wants it both ways. It has confined the allegations in the Indictment to the\nearlier time frame to try to prevent a legal challenge that would result in the dismissal of the\nMann Act Counts, but at the same time it seeks to introduce conduct from the later time period\nby joining the Perjury Counts. The government should not be permited to do so.\n\nIn addition, joinder of the Perjury Counts would prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it could\nimpact the ability of Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice to participate in the criminal trial. The\nPerjury Counts will involve complicated legal issues about permissible deposition questions,\nwhether the answers to the poorly formulated questions would have been alloued, the role of a\n\n?

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nBy leter to the Court, dated January 25, 2o2l (Dkt.ll7 at 2-3), the MDC raised objection\nto the Court’s order, unopposed by the government, directing the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to\nuse on a laptop computer on weekends and holidays. (Dkt. ll6 at 2). The MDC has failed to\nstate a valid or compelling reason for opposing the Court’s directive.\n\nThe MDC does not identify any valid reason why Ms. Maxwell cannot have access to the\nlaptop computer on weekends and holidays. The MDC does not argue, for example, that access\nto the laptop cannot be provided because of issues related to safety or security, staffing, or (to\nquote the government) the need to “manag[e] its inmate population.” Instead, in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to\nthe Court’s order, the MDC repeats its stock response: Ms. Maxwell has received significant\namount of time to review her discovery and has more contact with counsel than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted. The MDC’s fixation on the relative time Ms. Maxwell has been given to\nreview discovery is totally misguided. The government has produced millions of pages of\ndiscovery. Ms. Maxwell has the right to review all of them in order to prepare her defense for\ntrial. To do that, she needs access to the laptop for as much time as possible, including the\nweekends and holidays because the prison computers are incapable of reading the millions of\ndiscovery documents. Ms. Maxwell loses lo or more hours per week due to delay in receiving\nthe laptop, problems caused by the MDC computer, and inability to access the computer during\nmorning and afternoon counts on the weekends. Comparing Ms. Maxwell to other inmates does\nnot justify restricting her use of the laptop to review discovery.\n\nThe MDC’s proposed solution—that Ms. Maxwell can simply use the prison computer on\nthe weekends and holidays to review discovery—is uterly inadequate. As Ms. Maxwell has\npointed out on many occasions, the prison computer is incapable of reading a significant portion\nof the discovery, including but not limited to native files, Excel files, some video and audio files,\nand anything requiring Cellebrite software. The MDC concedes this fact in their leter—Ms.\nMaxwell cannot review all of her discovery on the prison computer. And using it causes a\ncolossal waste of time. For example, if Ms. Maxwell locates a document on the prison computer\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2339", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l3o Filed o2/ol/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nfor which she needs to review the native image, many of which are embedded in other files, she\nmust write doun the Bates number for that document and then wait until Monday to find the\nsame document using the laptop computer so that she can review the full document. Moreover,\nthe MDC computer shuts doun every two hours, requiring Ms. Maxwell to reboot the computer\nand find her place in the documents to resume her review. This process can take 2o-3o minutes,\nall of which is lost time. In addition, the pouer of central processing unit of the MDC computer\nis very slou. Uploading videos can take up to a half hour, time that cannot be used to review\nother documents. When the computer automatically shuts doun, videos need to be re-opened,\nrequiring Ms. Maxwell to locate the portion of the video she was viewing when the computer\nshut doun. In sum, using the prison computer is a problem, not a solution.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s review of discovery is challenging enough on the laptop computer that\nwas provided. Even with the laptop, Ms. Maxwell is unable to search, unable to print, and\nunable to tag or highlight documents for later review. She must review millions of pages of\nunwieldy documents produced in various formats (native, image, text) one page at a time—with\nno filtering or organizing—and record millions of Bates numbers and notes of her review by\nhand on the limited amount of paper she is provided. And she is not permited to have any\nsupplies to organize the voluminous legal papers. Hard drives provided by the government have\nbeen mishandled by MDC staff (dropped on the floor and slammed on a cart) causing them to\nbecome degraded and unstable and to randomly shut doun. While the laptop does not solve all of\nthese issues, it performs far beter than the MDC computers. The time, resources and funds\nexpended on problems caused by the electronic discovery and the computers is unnecessary,\nwasteful, and frustrating. The MDC is in no position - and is neither qualified nor experienced -\nto challenge Ms. Maxwell’s and her counsel’s claim that she needs access to the laptop on the\nweekends and holidays to even hope to finish reviewing the millions of pages of documents\nproduced in discovery.\n\nThe MDC’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell’s access to her atorneys is a reason to deny her\naccess to the laptop computer on weekend and holidays is non-sensical. One has absolutely\nnothing to do with the other. And it ignores the fact that, aside from time to review discovery or\ncommunicate with counsel, Ms. Maxwell is far more restricted than all other MDC inmates.\nOther inmates have unlimited time to communicate with other inmates. With exception of\ninmates detained in the SHU for disciplinary reasons, all other MDC inmates have unlimited\ntime to interact with other inmates. Other than calls with family or communication with counsel,\nMs. Maxwell has no human contact except with guards who wield pouer over her, overmanage\nher, and have psychologically and physically abused her. And complaints regarding\nmistreatment by guards have led to reprisals against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nRather than state a valid reason for opposing the Court’s directive, the MDC’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>\nshines a klieg light on the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all\ninmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes\nbeyond deprivation of liberty. Their ability to prepare for trial is compromised, their access to\ncounsel is restricted, and their right to effective assistance of counsel is jeopardized. The\npandemic has made the situation even more dire. Requiring pretrial detainees, including Ms.\nMaxwell, to review terabytes of electronic discovery on inadequate computers further tips an\nalready unlevel playing field to the detriment of criminal defendants.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo234o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002478.jpg": "IdasesT2O-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36-9 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 33 La\n\nl Document No. 23l, motion for sanctions.

Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the protection provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto prosecutions in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely prosecutions by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was intentional, as demonstrated by the express references\nelsewhere in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 23\n(Dkt. 68) (emphasis added).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 6 of 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2753", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002760.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l66 Filed o3/l5/2l Page 2 of 2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

First, the Government’s brief in\n<span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the Defendant’s pre-trial motions is a “judicial document” for purposes of the first\nelement of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir.\nl995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First Amendment\npresumption of access. /d. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrouly tailored to\nserve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access.\n\nLike the Government’s previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the\nGovernment bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are necessary to\nprotect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties’ personal\nprivacy interests. As a general mater, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for\novercoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d\n46o, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the\nGovernment’s brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit l contains a single redaction—the\nname of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual’s personal privacy interests\noutweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The\nproposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only\nthe names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety\nand privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that ataches to those\ndocuments.\n\nThe Court overrules the Defendant’s objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5\nof the Government’s brief and adopts the Government’s proposed redactions.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,.

The Government was accurate in\nits representation at the July l4, 2o2o initial appearance in this case both that the Government’s\n“investigation remain[ed] ongoing” and that the Government “d[id] not currently anticipate\nseeking a superseding indictment.” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l7 (emphasis added)). Both statements\nwere entirely accurate. At the time of the initial appearance in this case, the Government had not\nyet interviewed Minor Victim-4, so it had no way of anticipating that it would develop evidence\nwarranting a new charging instrument. Houever, both at that appearance and in subsequent\ncommunications with the Court, the Government repeatedly noted that its investigation remained\nongoing, and, more recently, when the Government did have some reason to believe that it might\nbe able to seek a superseding indictment, it signaled as much in its February 26, 2o2l <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>\nto the defense’s pretrial motions. (See Gov’t Mem. of Law in Opp. to Def. Pretrial Mots. at 3 n.l\n(“As the Government has repeatedly indicated, the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s co-\nconspirators remains ongoing.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong.

For the reasons that follou, the motions\nshould be denied in their entirety.\n\nFirst, the non-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida is entirely irrelevant to this case, and the defendant’s\nmotion fails as a mater of law. Second, the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which\nprovides an extended statute of limitations for crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors. The\ndefendant’s statute of limitations arguments run contrary to the text of the statute, the intent of\nCongress, and the weight of authority. Third, the defendant’s claim that the Government delayed\nin bringing the indictment fails as a mater of law and fact. Fourth, both of the defendant’s motions\nto suppress evidence obtained through a judicially approved subpoena are meritless, and her\nallegations of Government misconduct are baseless.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein.

The plain\nlanguage of the NPA states, without limitation, that “the United States .. . will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Because the Superseding\nIndictment (“Indictment”) contends that Ms. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, the NPA,\non its face, applies here. Thus, the government’s only argument, which it makes throughout its\n<span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, is that the NPA means something other than what it says.\n\nIn suggesting that the parties to the NPA intended to immunize only the four individuals\nspecifically named in the co-conspirator immunity provision, the government flagrantly ignores\nthe express statement that immunity is “not limited to” those individuals. In arguing that the\nprovision binds only the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida\n(“USAO-SDFL”), the government asks the Court to add the words “in this District” to that\nprovision, on the thin suggestion that the parties must have meant to include the same limitation\non location of prosecution that they included in Epstein’s immunity provision, even though they\nfailed to do so. And for good measure, the government asks the Court to find that the parties\nmust have intended to limit co-conspirator immunity to specific statutory offenses commited\nbetween 2ool and 2oo7, even though—again—no such limitation appears in the text of the co-\nconspirator immunity provision.\n\nNotwithstanding the bedrock principle that plea agreements are construed strictly against\nthe government, the government asks the Court to simply assume that the parties intended the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3878", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003879.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page6of23\nNPA to be read more narrouly than the language provides, arguing that follouing the NPA’s\nplain language would contradict “common sense.” (Opp.' 8, l6.) But a non-prosecution\nagreement is not an ordinary contract. Federal prosecutors knou hou to draft clear limitations\non promises made to criminal defendants, and they have a unique obligation to do so. What\nstrains “common sense” is the notion that any reasonable prosecutor who intended the NPA to be\nread as the government contends would have omited the limitations and modifications the\ngovernment nou seeks—particularly when dealing with a defendant who sought to “resolve\nglobally” his criminal liability. NPA at 2. The Court should therefore decline the government’s\ninvitation to rewrite the NPA to its liking, should enforce the NPA as writen, and should grant\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court should permit discovery and hold an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine the parties’ intent with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that the NPA unambiguously bars her prosecution here, and that neither\ndiscovery nor a hearing is necessary for the Court to grant this motion, the government’s\narguments regarding the NPA parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the consideration\nof evidence. Because Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty, has no personal knouledge regarding the\nparties’ intent and no access to relevant documents, she should be permited to take discovery in\nadvance of any hearing.\n\nl. The NPA Applies to Ms. Maxwell, and She Has Standing to Enforce It.\n\nThe NPA’s co-conspirator immunity provision forecloses “any criminal charges against\nany potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to” four named individuals.\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). The phrase “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” obviously\nincludes Ms. Maxwell.

See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (“the signatory parties\nunmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . .\nthat could include the Defendants”). And that class is clear from the face of the NPA: “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” i.e., anyone else who might be prosecuted in connection\nwith Epstein’s conduct. NPA at 5.\n\nAlthough the NPA expressly provides that that class is “including but not limited to” the\nfour individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government\nasks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR Report””) stating that the\nline prosecutor who negotiated the NPA “believed” that only the four individuals expressly\nnamed in the co-conspirator immunity provision “would benefit.” Opp. 2o-2l (quoting OPR\nReport at l67). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving “belief,” it\nis immaterial. By agreeing to immunize “potential” co-conspirators “including but not limited\nto” the four named individuals, the government explicitly agreed that the NPA would apply to\nany others who might be charged as co-conspirators in the future—a class that includes Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe OPR Report itself re-affirms the intent to extend immunity beyond those already\nidentified as potential co-conspirators.

R. Civ. P.\n3o(a)(2)(A)(i) and to conduct l7 separate depositions, almost twice the limit. Without legal\nsupport, Plaintiff atempts to conflate the presumptive time limitation for each deposition of\nseven hours with a right to take a total of 7o hours of depositions. This is an absurd reading of\nthe Federal Rules. The presumptive ten deposition limitation is an independent limitation, and\nspeaks to the number of separate deponents, not deposition time. Indeed, the two independent\nlimitations do not even appear in the same section of the rules.\n\nThe heart of Plaintiffs argument is that Ms. Maxwell inconveniently testified and denied\nPlaintiff's claims, rather than invoking the Fifth Amendment. This dashed Plaintiff's apparent\nhope to obtain an adverse inference, rather than actually having to prove her case against Ms.\nMaxwell. Instead, Ms. Maxwell fully testified for the entire 7 hours, responded to all questions\nposed to her,' and testified based on her actual knouledge. Ms. Maxwell’s testimony simply\nbears no relevance to Plaintiff's request to take more than lo depositions of non-party witnesses.\n\nConspicuously absent from Plaintiff's motion are (a) any actual information she believes\nthese witnesses may provide which is neither cumulative nor duplicative of other information\nalready disclosed in this case, (b) the fact the information can be obtained from other sources,\n\n' Plaintiff flatly mis-represents to the Court that Ms. Maxwell “refused” to answer the questions posed to\nher, as the actual transcript amply demonstrates. Ms. Maxwell did not avoid any questions and answered\nall questions to the best of her recollection relating to alleged events l5 years ago. The majority of the\nbullet point “summary” of the maters about which Ms. Maxwell could not testify were based either on a\nlack of any personal knouledge or the fact that the events claimed by Plaintiff did not actually happen.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004213.jpg": "Casask lg -Qn8IaRARW SPasuauenemehes FidecbeWmeMs! pdgacerts afl2\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nI certify that on June 6, 2ol6, I electronically served this Defendant's Response in <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to\nMotion to Exceed Presumptive Ten Deposition Limit via ECF on the follouing:\nSigrid S.

It concedes that any such charge as to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred. (Opp. l64). It concedes that it cannot shou that either Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein ever engaged, or sought to engage, in unlawful sexual activity with Accuser-3, who at all\nrelevant times was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged activity as to\nAccuser-3 occurred.

And it concedes that it cannot establish that either Ms.\nMaxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3 to travel while she was a minor.\n(Opp. l63 n.58.)\n\nYet the government argues that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein’s alleged lawful interactions\nwith Accuser-3 were somehou “part of” and “in furtherance of” a conspiracy to entice or cause\nunderage girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Opp. l6l, l63. The\ngovernment’s argument defies logic. The government does not and cannot explain hou\npurported lawful, consensual sexual activity in England was part of an alleged conspiracy to\ncause minors to travel in the United States. Its eleventh-hour effort to salvage its allegations\nregarding Accuser-3 by proffering evidence that she [tis\nevidence that the grand jury did not include in the Superseding Indictment\n(“Indictment”) —does not establish the relevance of those allegations, given the government’s\ninability to shou that Accuser-3 ee.\n\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page5ofl4\n\nEven more incomprehensible is the government’s argument that the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 are not prejudicial. The government concedes that it has characterized Accuser-3’s\nlawful, consensual sexual encounters with Epstein as “sexual[] abuse[],” based solely on\nAccuser-3’s “subjective experience” of those encounters. By characterizing those encounters as\n“sexual[] abuse[],” the government has falsely accused Ms. Maxwell of a crime that it nou\nadmits she did not commit, improperly broadening the charges against her by implying that she\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of three minors rather than two. The allegations as to Accuser-3\nare thus irrelevant and prejudicial and should be stricken. At minimum, the allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell was complicit in the purported sexual abuse of Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\nFinally, the government effectively concedes that the admissibility of evidence regarding\nAccuser-3 must be litigated under Fed.

While the government’s effort to\nestablish the admissibility of such evidence in its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> suffers from the same infirmities as\nits inclusion of the allegations regarding Accuser-3 in the Indictment, Ms. Maxwell will respond\nto the government’s admissibility arguments more fully at the appropriate time.\n\nl. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged Conspiracies.\n\nThe Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to (l) violate l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more individuals to travel in interstate and\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (Indictment 4 9-lo);\nand (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective of transporting an individual under age l8\nwith the intent that the individual engage in unlawful sexual activity (/d. J] l5-l6). As an overt\nact in furtherance of these conspiracies, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd. JJ lld, l7d (emphasis added). The\nIndictment further alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3.

For\nexample, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s alleged role in purported lawful sexual\nactivity involving Epstein and Accuser-3 in England is “evidence of the defendant’s agreements\nwith Epstein to identify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.”\n(Opp. l62.) But the Indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to\n“entice” minor girls to commit illegal sex acts, let alone to “identify minor girls” for such an\nenticement. Nor could it, since mere “enticement” to commit illegal sex acts is insufficient to\nestablish a Mann Act violation. The alleged conspiracies were conspiracies to entice or cause\nminors to travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sex acts, and the Indictment does not allege\nthat Accuser-3 ever traveled or engaged in illegal sex acts.\n\nThe government commits a similar Freudian slip in its atempt to distinguish United\nStates v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), when it states that “the allegations regarding\n[Accuser-3] involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the conspiracy: grooming a minor\ngirl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein.” Opp. l64 n.59. The “heartland of the\nconspiracy” is actual or contemplated interstate travel of minor girls to engage in unlawful\nsexual acts with Epstein, which the government cannot establish with respect to Accuser-3. The\ngovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> repeatedly treats interstate travel, the linchpin of federal court\nJurisdiction over the alleged conduct and the necessary object of the conspiracies alleged, as a\nthrouaway element of its case.\n\nIn short, neither the allegations regarding Accuser-3 nor the government’s proffer\nestablish an intent that Accuser-3 (i) engage in “illegal sex acts” or (ll) travel while a minor.

Nor can she make appropriate motions to preclude the\ngovernment’s use of this evidence, as it falls outside of the scope of the charged conspiracies.\nMoreover, the government continues to refuse to provide Ms. Maxwell the most basic piece of\ninformation she needs to prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo423l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page6ofl6\nl.

Here, the revelation of new allegations from Accuser-3 disclosed\nfor the first time in the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, as well as the government’s continuing refusal\nto identify the names of the three accusers, justify the need for a bill of particulars to prevent\nunfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nFirst, as it has done since the beginning of this case, the government continues to deny\nMs. Maxwell the most basic piece of information she needs to investigate the allegations against\nher and prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused her of the crimes\ncharged in the Indictment. Rather than atempt to justify withholding this information out of\nconcer for the accusers’ safety or privacy—an untenable argument, given that two of the three\naccusers, if we are correct about their identities, have already publicly identified themselves—the\ngovernment instead argues that because it has provided enough information for Ms. Maxwell to\nguess who they are, there is no need to disclose their names at this point. (Opp. l8l-82). Ms.\nMaxwell should not have to rely on guesswork to prepare for trial, especially when the testimony\nof these three accusers will comprise the core of the government’s proof. With trial only four\nmonths away, Ms. Maxwell’s need to have sufficient time to investigate the allegations against\nher vastly outweighs any countervailing interest the accusers may have in remaining anonymous.\nIf the government is unwilling to provide the names of the accusers, the Court should order the\ngovernment to do so either as part of a bill of particulars or pursuant to its inherent authority to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4233", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 7 of l6\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses.

The Indictment makes no mention of these allegations, nor is there any\ninformation in the discovery indicating that they would be part of the government’s case. The\ngovernment therefore cannot argue, as it does in its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, that the information provided in\nthe Indictment and the discovery produced to date are sufficient for Ms. Maxwell to understand\nthe nature of the charges against her, especially when only a small fraction of the discovery\npertains to the time period charged in the Indictment.

See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars necessary to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is irrelevant to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only necessary so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case. See United States v. Hsia, 24 F.

(Dkt. l48 at l4-l5). In response,\nthe government does not atempt to rebut Ms. Maxwell’s justifications for accelerated disclosure\nof these materials.

The government may seek to introduce evidence of “other acts” that took\nplace in new locations and possibly other foreign countries.

The\ndefense’s request for yet earlier disclosure is unfounded and reflects a significant—and\nunwarranted—departure from the practices in this District.\n\nConsistent with the Government’s previously stated position (Dkt. No. 2o4 at l92), it is\nentirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of any co-conspirator statements through\nJencks Act materials and marked exhibits. This is because the Government only intends to\nintroduce co-conspirator statements either through the testimony of witnesses, which will be\npreviewed in the Jencks Act material, or in the exhibits, which will be marked before trial. As the\nGovernment has previously noted, the Second Circuit has rejected the notion that non-exculpatory\nco-conspirator statements are discoverable by Rule l6 or by any other means other than the Jencks\nAct. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing\nDistrict Court’s order directing the Government “to produce all oral statements made by the\ndefendants and coconspirators that the Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a\ndefendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol). The cases cited by the defense all involved orders granting\nbills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all alleged coconspirators. They\ndid not involve orders directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the Government\nmay introduce at trial. Indeed, the Government is unaware of any case in which such particularized\nnotice distinct from the production of Jencks Act and marked exhibits has been ordered, and the\ndefense cites none. This Court has already denied the defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars\nfor Counts One through Four (see Dkt.

See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Pagel of 26\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neon nn nn nn eX\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- i S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n22-22 + -- - ee  - -  - - - - X\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM IN <span class=\"highlight\">OPPOSITION</span>\nTO THE DEFENDANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL PRE-TRIAL MOTIONS\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nAtorney for the United States of America\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n- Of Counsel -\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page5of26\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nwenn nen nnn eee X\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- i S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\na re eee ere RE\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s\nsupplemental pre-trial motions, dated May 7, 2o2l (the “Defense Motions”).

(Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating procedure: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed questionnaire seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an invitation to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and impartial jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury selection eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or motivated to serve for reasons beyond being fair and impartial.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\nsupervisory pouers and discretion and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Surplusage from\nSuperseding Indictment (Dkt. l46) at l-3, 6-9. Ms. Maxwell noted that (l) according to\nAccuser-3’s oun allegations, she was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (l6\nyears old) when the sex acts supposedly took place and therefore any sex acts that occurred were\nlawful and could not be considered “sexual abuse”; and (2) the indictment did not allege any\ntravel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any\naction taken by Ms. Maxwell or Epstein, which was a critical element of both charged\nconspiracies. /d. at 4-5.\n\nIn its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, the government scrambled to paper over these problems by providing a\nmuch fuller proffer of Accuser-3’s expected testimony.

See Cummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d at 437\n(quoting Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d at 64); see also United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp. 2d 299, 3ll\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo2), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (the\n“scope of the conspiratorial agreement” is the key to determining whether “an overt act may\nproperly be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy” (quoting Grunewald v. United States,\n353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)).\n\nIn its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s motion to strike, the government argued that because a\nconspiracy “does not require a completed substantive crime,” Accuser-3’s allegations could still\nbe admited as direct proof of the charged conspiracies even though she did not travel as a minor\nor engage in illegal sex acts because Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” her to engage in those\nsex acts. Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l6l-l63 (citing Salinas v.\nUnited States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997)). That argument misses the mark. While it is true that a\nconspiracy does not require a completed substantive crime, Salinas itself states that “[a]\nconspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the\nelements of a substantive criminal offense.” Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65. As to Accuser-3, the\ncompleted endeavor—i.e., her alleged sex acts with Epstein—was not a substantive criminal\noffense. Even if we accept her allegations as true (which we do not), there is nothing unlawful\nabout encouraging an adult to engage in entirely lawful sex acts. Hence, Accuser-3’s allegations\nare not direct proof of the charged conspiracies regardless of whether Ms. Maxwell allegedly\n“sroomed” her (which she did not).\n\nThe Court should not admit Accuser-3’s allegations as intrinsic proof of the charged\nconspiracies either. See Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d at 37o (listing three categories of “intrinsic”\nproof not considered Rule 4o4(b) evidence). The Mann Act conspiracies in the S2 Indictment\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5676", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel5of2l\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and will mislead the jury into believing that the alleged sex acts\nbetween Epstein and Accuser-3 were unlawful.\n\nThe Second Circuit takes an “inclusionary approach” to Rule 4o4(b) evidence, which\nadmits “other act” evidence “that does not serve the sole purpose of shouing the defendant’s bad\ncharacter and that is neither overly prejudicial under Rule 4o3 nor irrelevant under Rule 4o2.\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 56 (citing United States v. Pascarella, 84 F.3d 6l, 69 (2d Cir. l996)). The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “‘to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

(See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue. (See Def. Mots. 5, 6, lo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5787", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5834", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting instruction\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5836", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006025.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 399 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page3of4\nPage 3\nExclude GX-52 should be filed under seal because it contains phone numbers, addresses, email\naddresses and other personally identifying information that must be sealed.\n\n5.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to releasing Ghislaine Maxwell from pretrial detention\n(Dkt. 423) is a long-winded regurgitation of prior writings and rulings and underscores its\ndetermination to ignore the presumption of innocence and punish Ms. Maxwell pretrial for her\nassociation with Jeffrey Epstein. The indictment against her federalizes a New York State B\nmisdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of 9o days. Ms. Maxwell, who awaits trial, has\nserved that five times over. Ms. Maxwell is not, and has never been, a flight risk. At every\nopportunity, Ms. Maxwell has vigorously asserted her innocence and her eagerness to face these\nunsubstantiated charges in court. She should be alloued to do so outside of the confines of the\nMDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial,\nnegatively impact her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.\n\nThe Court nou has the 35oo material and Giglio material which seriously undermine the\nstrength of the government’s case and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the\ngovernment cannot and does not even atempt to refute. Rather, the government urges the Court\nto rely on prior rulings that were based on government conjecture that is not substantiated by\nrecent disclosures. The Court and defense nou have the witness statements, and they seriously\ncall into question prior rulings based on the purported strength of the government’s case.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006534.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 4o\nthat might be relevant to the jury’s deliberations as to the credibility or knouledgeability of the\nwitness.” Marcus, 2oo7 WL 33o388, at *l (citing Marti, 42l F.2d at l266).

See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Surplusage from\nSuperseding Indictment (Dkt. l46) at l-3, 6-9. Ms. Maxwell noted that (l) according to\nAccuser-3’s oun allegations, she was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (l6\nyears old) when the sex acts supposedly took place and therefore any sex acts that occurred were\nlawful and could not be considered “sexual abuse”; and (2) the indictment did not allege any\ntravel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any\naction taken by Ms. Maxwell or Epstein, which was a critical element of both charged\nconspiracies. /d. at 4-5.\n\nIn its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, the government scrambled to paper over these problems by providing a\nmuch fuller proffer of Accuser-3’s expected testimony. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s\nPretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59 & n.56.

United States,\n353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)).\n\nIn its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s motion to strike, the government argued that because a\nconspiracy “does not require a completed substantive crime,” Accuser-3’s allegations could still\nbe admited as direct proof of the charged conspiracies even though she did not travel as a minor\nor engage in illegal sex acts because Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” her to engage in those\nsex acts. Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l6l-l63 (citing Salinas v.\nUnited States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997)). That argument misses the mark. While it is true that a\nconspiracy does not require a completed substantive crime, Salinas itself states that “[a]\nconspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the\nelements of a substantive criminal offense.” Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65. As to Accuser-3, the\ncompleted endeavor—i.e., her alleged sex acts with Epstein—was not a substantive criminal\noffense. Even if we accept her allegations as true (which we do not), there is nothing unlawful\nabout encouraging an adult to engage in entirely lawful sex acts. Hence, Accuser-3’s allegations\nare not direct proof of the charged conspiracies regardless of whether Ms. Maxwell allegedly\n“sroomed” her (which she did not).\n\nThe Court should not admit Accuser-3’s allegations as intrinsic proof of the charged\nconspiracies either. See Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d at 37o (listing three categories of “intrinsic”\nproof not considered Rule 4o4(b) evidence).

Pascarella, 84 F.3d 6l, 69 (2d Cir. l996)). The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\nThe Government's Justifications for redaction (Docket No. 399, docketed at lo:o6\npm on Friday Oct 29) cites Lugosch then says \"The Government also seeks sealing\nof trial exhibits, where are not public.” Inner City Press immediately opposes this.\nAs one example within this motions of limine, the Government has redacted the\nentirely of its Argument X, even the title and the page number. And as to trial\nexhibits, see for example Judge Jed S. Rakoff's order in US v. Weigand, 2o-cr-l88\n(JSR) htps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2o536946-rakofforderonmrlicp\nThere, Judge Rakoff ordered the US Atorney's Office to make trial exhibit\navailable to the public at large. While this was done, belatedly, in US v. Parnas, it\nwas refused in the current US v. Cole. It cannot be refused in this case.\nAlso, Inner City Press understands that the listen-only call-in telephone lines\navailable so far in the case, there may be an atempt to discontinue them. The Court\nshould take judicial notice of continue COVID-l9 issues, including people's\nunderstandable concerns about congregating even in so-called overflou rooms. Be\naware that the District for the District of Columbia still allous public phone access\nto all criminal proceedings, even those held in-person. That should happen here.\nThe loss of First Amendment freedoms, even for a short period of time,\nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury. Elrod v.

For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue. (See Def. Mots. 5, 6, lo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6759", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting instruction\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo676l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465_ Filed ll/l5/2l Page3ofl27 3\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl Counsel, I'm prepared to turn to the motions first,\n\n2 unless there's any reason to deviate from that.\n\n3 Ms. Moe?\n\n4 MS.

The government’s leter focuses\nexclusively on the authentication question. The government does not address the business records\nexception or even atempt to justify the admission of Exhibit 52 despite it being hearsay.\n\nThe government also conveniently ignores all it said before about why Exhibit 52 was\nrelevant and hou it would be admited and used as evidence. The government first said Exhibit\n52 was Ms. Maxwell’s book. That was the entire premise of the government’s November l2\nleter and its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s motion in limine.

The government’s decision not to call Employee-l confirms what\nMs. Maxwell has been saying all along: Exhibit 52 did not belong to her, and Employee-l was\nnever going to testify that it did.\n\nFinally, it would be exceedingly unfair were the government to admit Exhibit 52 at this\nlate stage in its case, having nou abandoned its earlier arguments for admissibility and relevance.\nAs this Court recognized earlier today, Mr. Alessi is done testifying, and Ms. Maxwell cannot be\n\n' We knou the government has abandoned this argument because it relies on Ms.\nMaxwell’s deposition testimony as the basis for admiting Exhibit 52.

This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n?

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is in receipt of the parties’ leters addressing the Defendant’s request to\ntemporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits, and the Government’s\nresponse in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> and accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 59o, 594, 595. Several media\norganizations have also filed leters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s\nmotion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The\nDefendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 5o’s motion.\n\nFor the reasons outlined more fully belou, the Court rules as follous. First, the\nDefendant’s motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a\nnew trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrouly tailored to serve\ncompeting interests. In this case, important interests include preserving the integrity of any\ninquiry process going forward as well as protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Protection of\nthese interests, houever, can plainly be accomplished through tailored redactions. Follouing the\nCourt’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if one is ordered, all redactions will be\npromptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page4of7\n\nAccordingly, the Defendant’s motion to keep the papers under seal in their entirety is\ndenied. Instead, the parties must propose narrouly tailored redactions as necessary to serve\nimportant interests. Here those interests are to ensure the integrity of any inquiry going forward\nand to protect juror anonymity and privacy. Those interests justify redaction of the questions the\nparties propose be asked at any hearing. See United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7) (requiring proposed questions to be\nsubmited directly to the court); see also Dkt. No. 329 at 38-39 (counsel discussing concern that\ndisclosing specific questions ahead of hearing would allou juror to prepare and “rehearse the\nanswers”). And they may justify redaction of any specific factual information developed by the\nparties that has not been publicly reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired\nabout at any forthcoming hearing. The Court will also permit redactions necessary to ensure\njuror anonymity and privacy. See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464\nU.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). By contrast, there is no basis to redact legal arguments, case citations,\nand analysis regarding the standard by which the parties contend that the Defendant’s motion\nshould be evaluated, as well as legal arguments, case citations, and analysis regarding the proper\nscope of any potential hearing. Nor will the Court permit the redaction of information that is\nwidely reported in the press. Such redactions do not conform with the dictates of Lugosch and\nare not necessary to protect the integrity of any inquiry.\n\nImportantly, follouing the Court’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if\none is ordered, all redactions will be promptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any\ncontinuing interest in juror anonymity and privacy.\n\nThe parties are thus ORDERED to propose narrouly tailored redactions to the Defense\nmotion, the Government’s response in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, and the Defense reply, as consistent with this\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 - Filed o2/ll/22 Page5of7\nOrder, via email on or before February l6, 2o22. Because this Order resolves the scope of\nredactions for all filings related to the motion, the Court adjourns sine die the briefing schedule\npreviously set for the parties to justify any proposed sealing or redactions to the new trial motion\npapers. See Dkt. No. 585. The Court will rule on the proposed redactions so the filings can be\ndocketed, and the Court will file under seal unredacted copies of any documents for which\nredactions are approved.\n\nAt the time the briefs are docketed with approved redactions, the Defendant is further\nORDERED to docket Exhibits 2 and 3 to her motion and the exhibit to her reply, and the\nGovernment ORDERED to docket all exhibits to its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, all of which are publicly\navailable documents.!\n\nI.

Defense Motion, at 5l-52; Government Response, at 44; see also\nDefense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22. The Court denies the motion. Juror 5o cites no authority to support\na juror’s intervention when he will possibly be subject to a post-verdict inquiry. The cases he\ncites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to intervene to assert First Amendment access\nby the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of privileged information.\nAlthough cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into\nallegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 5o does have, no cases support intervention.

Mot.’’) (Dkt. No. 599).\nLEGAL STANDARD\n\nUnder Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a court “must enter a judgment\nof acquital of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 29(a). “In reviewing a Rule 29 motion, the court ‘must view the evidence in a light that\nis most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable inferences resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.’” United States v. Joseph, No. 2o Cr. 6o3 (PKC), 2o22 WL 336975, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. 4, 2o22) (quoting United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4)). The court\n“must ‘defer to the jury’s evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, its choices between permissible\ninferences, and its assessment of the weight of the evidence.’” Jd. (quoting United States v. Jones,\n482 F.3d 6o, 68 (2d Cir. 2oo6)). A conviction must be upheld “if any rational trier of fact could\nhave found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Peters, 843 F. App’x\nat 372; see also United States v. Cuti, 72o F.3d 453, 46l (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“A judgment of acquital\ncan be entered only if the evidence that the defendant commited the crime alleged is nonexistent\nor so meager that no reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”).\n\nRule 33 provides, in relevant part, that “[uJpon the defendant’s motion, the court may\nvacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9565", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 47 of5l\n\nAs the Government explained in its memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s twelve\npre-trial motions, dated February 26, 2o2l (Dkt. No. 2o4 at 4l-59), and in its memorandum in\n<span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s supplemental motions, dated May 2l, 2o2l (Dkt. No. 295 at l3-l6),\nthe Indictments in this case were brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s collection of\nevidence to support the charges. Any suggestion that the Government intentionally delayed\nobtaining the Indictments to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in fact, and for good\nreason: itis not true. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay,\nmuch less an intentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nIn her current motion, the defendant offers no additional argument or factual claims\nwhatsoever in support of her argument that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-\nindictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. Indeed, she\nignores the second prong of the pre-indictment delay standard and refers the Court back to her\nprior briefing, which this Court has twice considered and rejected. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7; Dkt. No.\n3l7 at lo). If anything, the trial record undermined the defendant’s argument on this prong. In an\neffort to shou the victims’ supposed financial motivations for testifying, the defendant repeatedly\nfocused the jury’s atention on the fact that victims only recently agreed to cooperate with the\nGovernment. That same evidence precludes any argument of intentional delay by the Government.\nThe defendant’s renewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon\npre-indictment delay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 6l of 66\nno legal effect). Although Rule l2(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure references\n“pleadings,” “a district court has the inherent pouer to strike a party's submissions other\nthan pleadings.” Mazzeo v. Gibbons, No. 2:o8-CV-ol387-RLH-PA, 2olo WL 39loo72,\nat *3 (D. Nev. Sept. 3o, 2olo); see also Metzger v. Hussman, 682 F. Supp. llo9, llo\n(D.

Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F.

In keeping with these principles, a\ndefendant seeking a new trial based on a juror’s statements during voir dire faces the heavy burden\nof establishing both that the juror deliberately lied, and that the juror otherwise would have been\nstruck for cause. Id. at 556; United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l8 (2d Cir. l994). On the\npresent record, the defendant has not come close to establishing that the extraordinary remedy of\na new trial is warranted.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion based on the\npresent record.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\ntransport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel4 of 24\nCourt’s error was compounded by its earlier refusal to instruct the jury that Jane’s sexual abuse\nin New Mexico could not be considered “illegal sexual activity” as charged in the Indictment\nbecause it was not a violation of New York law, as it had instructed with regard to Kate and\nAnnie Farmer’s testimony. (Tr. 2775-77). As a result, the jury instructions were insufficient to\nproperly instruct the jury on the law and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of a crime other than the one alleged in the Indictment. Moreover, because the Mann\nAct conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) required an identical finding of intent, there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury improperly convicted Ms. Maxwell on those counts based on\nthe same conduct. Accordingly, the Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts\nOne, Three, and Four, and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nIl. All Three Conspiracy Counts Are Multiplicitous Because They Are Based on a\n\nSingle Underlying Criminal Scheme.\n\nThe government concedes in its <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> that the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three are so similar that they are multiplicitous, and that the Court should only\nenter judgment as to one of those two counts. (Opp. at 24) (“[T]he Government agrees that the\nCourt should enter judgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the\nsimilarities between those counts.”). The government maintains, houever, that the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five is not multiplicitous and that the Court should enter\njudgment on Counts Three and Five because they “arose from different criminal schemes,\ninvolving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates, and a different modus\noperandi.” (Opp. at 24).\n\nThe government’s atempt to separate and distinguish the conspiracies charged in Counts\nThree and Five is directly contrary to its theory of prosecution and the proof at trial, and flies in\nthe face of the arguments the government made to the jury. The government never framed these\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo28o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagelofl6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neon no nn nn nn nn nn - X\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- i S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n222-2 ---- +--+ +--+ eX\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM IN <span class=\"highlight\">OPPOSITION</span>\nTO THE DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nAtorney for the United States of America\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n- Of Counsel -\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo29l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page3ofl6\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nee 4\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n\n-V.- i S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\n\nDefendant. :\n\nree greene EP\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in further support of its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>\nto the defendant’s motion for a new trial, dated January l9, 2o22 (the “Defense Motion”). After\nthe thoughtful and thorough hearing held by this Court, it is crystal clear that the defendant\nreceived a fair trial. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing made evident that he did not\ndeliberately lie in completing the questionnaire, but that he instead made an honest mistake. And\nin any event, had Juror 5o accurately reported in his questionnaire that he had been a victim of\nsexual abuse, he would not have been struck for cause. Juror 5o repeatedly explained—yjust as he\ndid during voir dire—that he would be fair and impartial and would decide the case based on the\nevidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. Accordingly, under controlling Supreme\nCourt and Second Circuit precedent, the defendant cannot shou that Juror 5o harbored any bias\nagainst the defendant. Moreover, during voir dire, multiple other potential jurors in this case\nreported having experienced sexual abuse and were nonetheless qualified as jurors without any\nobjection from the defendant. It was entirely appropriate for Juror 5o to sit on this jury, and nothing\nabout his service as a juror calls into question the integrity of the verdict in this case.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo293", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page 4ofl6\n\nIn short, at each step of the analysis, the defendant has not come close to establishing that\nthe extraordinary remedy of a new trial is warranted. Accordingly, the Court should deny the\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a conjunctive two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to\nanswer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The defendant cannot satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test.\n\nA. The Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate Falsehood\n\nAs set forth in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the Defense Motion, to satisfy the first\nprong, the defendant must demonstrate that the juror commited a deliberate falsehood, not an\nhonest mistake.! (Dkt. No. 643 at ll, l3-l5). There is no evidence in the record that Juror 5o\n' In her reply brief (Dkt. No. 644 at l2-l4), the defendant asks the Court to ignore the Second\nCircuit’s binding, on-point decision in United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll (2d Cir. l994), which\nrequires deliberateness. The Court should reject this invitation.\nThe defendant asserts that Shaoul’s holding that “a defendant must shou . . . that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer,” id. at 8l6, is dicta, claiming that Shaoul was decided on the second prong of\nthe McDonough test. (Dkt. No. 644 at l2). Not so. In Shaoul, the Circuit expressly affirmed the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the defendant “had failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of the\nMcDonough test,” before concluding that he “also cannot satisfy the second part.” /d.; see, e.g.,\nPyet v. Pa. Bldg. Co., 498 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“Our conclusion . . . was an alternative\nholding, not dicta, and continues to bind our Court.”), rev'd on other grounds sub nom., l4 Penn\nPlaza LLC v. Pyet, 56 U.S. 247 (2oo9). This holding stands in stark contrast to the passing\nstatements made in later cases the defendant cites, which did not consider whether the first prong\nrequires deliberateness, much less reject Shaoul. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3-\nOo5 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (explaining that only two “alleged intentional omissions” justified further\ninquiry, but even if proved, neither would have satisfied the second prong); United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government writes in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s motion for an arrest warrant for\nKelly Bovino. It is not clear that Bovino is under subpoena for the same reasons Robert Glassman\nhas previously articulated.! Assuming she is, houever, the defense leter correctly states that the\nCourt “has authority” to issue an arrest warrant. (Def. Leter at 2-3). But the Court is not required\nto do so, and in this case, the Court should exercise its discretion to not sign the arrest warrant.\nThe defendant has been aware of the 35oo material that forms the basis of the defendant’s\n' The defense subpoena was served on November 3o, 2o2l, (see Def. Leter Ex. 2), but it required\nher to appear at the United States Courthouse at 9:oo a.m. on November 29, 2o2l (see id. Ex. l)—\nan impossibility. The defense has cited no law for the proposition that Bovino has refused to\n“comply with an order of the court to testify,” 28 U.S.C. § l826, by failing to comply with a\nsubpoena with which she could never have complied.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of4\nthat the district court abused its discretion in denying a continuance to permit the witness to be\nbrought to trial.” Jd.; see also Untied States v. DeCologero, 53o F.3d 36, 74 (lst Cir. 2oo8)\n(collecting cases and granting a motion to transport but refusing to order the Marshals to expedite\nit and denying a continuance because the request was “quite belated[]’’).\n\nAdditionally, Bovino’s testimony is in no way vital. The defendant articulated a theory of\nrelevance in her <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the Government’s motion to preclude, and it is the same theory that\nthe defendant articulated as to two other witnesses. The defendant will suffer no significant\nprejudice by denial of her motion.\n\nFinally, what the defendant posits is no mere delay until Monday. What the defendant\nsuggests is to direct the Marshals Service to arrest a defendant located in California, detain her, fly\nher across the country, and possibly arrange counsel for her, all so that she may provide a few\nminutes of testimony. Under the unique facts of this case—a lengthy trial in the middle of a global\npandemic, with looming extended breaks for two holidays—an arrest warrant would likely cause\nsignificant delay and risk to the trial. The defendant’s eleventh-hour request for such an extended\ndelay is not justified under these circumstances.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of7\nirrelevant. If a commercial sex act occurred involving a l7-year-old in New York, that sexual\nactivity is illegal under l8 U.S.C. § l59l because it involves a minor, even though it is above New\nYork’s age of consent. Although the instruction uses the phrase “illegal sexual activity,” an\nelement of the Mann Act, the jury is likely not to grasp that point in a short mid-trial instruction,\ndivorced from a discussion of the elements of the offenses. The jury would therefore also be\nconfused into thinking incorrectly that sexual activity that is “not illegal” under the local law is\nsimilarly lawful under federal law.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that—as to New Mexico in particular—age of consent is\nnot a simple and straightforward question. As the defense noted in their <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the\nGovernment’s motions in limine, “New Mexico does not have a specific age of consent.” (Def.\nOpp. at 46, Dkt. No. 483). The age of consent can also depend on the specific sexual act involved,\nwhich may require analysis of New Mexico state law in comparison to the facts elicited at trial.\nCompare id. at 46 & n.43 (noting that the age of consent depends on whether coercion or force are\ninvolved), with State v. Begaye, -- P. 3d --, 2o2l WL 5l73l5o, at * 2 (N.M. Ct. App. 2o2l)\n(affirming conviction of defendant who forcibly hugged a sixteen-year-old and, when releasing\nher, “brushed his hand over her chest and squeezed her breast”). It therefore cannot be said that a\nsexual act in New Mexico was “above the age of consent” without determining what sexual act\noccurred and hou New Mexico state law would treat that act.\n\nIn the Government’s view, these issues are best explained to the jury in the concluding jury\ninstructions, where the jury can be fully instructed on the relevant law and then apply that law to\nthe facts it finds have been established at trial. And no limiting instruction is needed because, as\nwill be explained to the jury in the concluding instructions, they can only convict for violations of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l8 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagelof3\n8oo Third Avenue\nNew York, NY loo22\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP +l2l2 957 76oo phone\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

It should be noted that defense counsel did not\nquestion Jane about this demand when they had a chance, so there is no impeachment value to\nanything Mr. Glassman could say. It should also be noted that Ms. Maxwell or Ms. Menninger\n(who represented Ms. Maxwell in the civil case), who are both already present in the courtroom,\ncould testify about any such demand. So there is nothing Mr. Glassman could offer on this\nsubject that would be probative and outweigh the risk of possible disclosure of confidential\ninformation inherent in calling Jane's atorney to the witness stand. Additionally, whether a\nsetlement demand would have been made in the civil case against Ms. Maxwell seems wholly\nirrelevant as that civil case setled well over a year before Jane testified; that is, at the time Jane\ntestified in the criminal trial, she had no financial incentive to do so.\n\nWith regard to demands to the EVCP, Jane adopts the arguments made by the\nGovernment in its <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, and adds again that the civil case setled long before Jane's\ntestimony in the criminal trial against Ms. Maxwell — so Jane had no financial interest in the\nsubstance of her testimony.\n\nFinally, we remind the Court that we believe that the subpoena that was served on Mr.\nGlassman was invalid under Fed.

Four motions to quash were filed, one each by\nthe government,! the administrator of the EVCP, Accuser-2, and Witness-3. Neither Accuser-]\nnor Accuser-4 moved to quash. As explained belou, the arguments against enforcement of Ms.\nMaxwell’s subpoena lack merit, and this Court should deny the motions to quash.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nOn November l5, this Court issued a Rule l7(c) subpoena to the EVCP at the request of\nMs. Maxwell. The subpoena is narrou, specific, and targeted. It seeks just four categories of\n\n' There is significant doubt whether the government has standing to move to quash, cither\nin its oun capacity or on behalf of the accusers. See United States v.

Even so, because the\nadministrator of the EVCP and two of the accusers moved to quash, Ms. Maxwell will respond to\nall the arguments made in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to her subpoena, even the government’s.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015065.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page4oflo\n\nIll. Discussion\n\nA. The In re Craig Factors\n\nThe Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors\nand any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. /n re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can\ngovernment <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> preclude it.”). While the Government acknouledges the extraordinary\n? See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at\nFederal Prison - United States House Commitee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense\npublic interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the ll9th Congress, on February ll, 2o25, the\nCommitee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a leter to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession\nregarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.” On May 8, the Task Force\nsent another leter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein\nfiles’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015066.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page5oflo\nnature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the\nunderlying proceedings.\n\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to public\ndisclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015087.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 Filed o8/o5/25 Pagelof9\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 2o-CR-33o (PAE)\n\nVs.\n\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL.\n\na\n\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL’S RESPONSE IN <span class=\"highlight\">OPPOSITION</span> TO\nGOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO UNSEAL GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS\n\nAlthough the government did not oppose allouing the defense to review the\ngrand jury material to assess whether to object to its release, the Court denied that\nrequest. As a result, Ghislaine Maxwell has not seen the material and cannot take\nan informed position. Given that she is actively litigating her case and does not knou\nwhat is in the grand jury record, she has no choice but to respectfully oppose the\ngovernment’s motion to unseal it.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nJeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not. Whatever interest the\npublic may have in Epstein, that interest cannot justify a broad intrusion into grand\njury secrecy in a case where the defendant is alive, her legal options are viable, and\nher due process rights remain.\n\nWhen Epstein died, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York\npivoted and made Maxwell the face of his crimes. She became the scapegoat and the\nonly person the government could put on trial. She was convicted in a media\nfirestorm of false reporting and mischaracterization of evidence. Nou, with her case\npending before the Supreme Court, the government seeks to unseal untested,\n\nLERETE MOSS\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015092.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page6eof9\ninstitution and others, Judge Hellerstein granted a petition to unseal the grand jury\ntestimony of David Greenglass, Ethel Rosenberg’s brother. In granting the petition\nto unseal Greenglass’ grand jury testimony, the court observed that in the 65 years\nthat had passed since the Rosenberg trial, many believed that Ethel Rosenberg was\ninnocent and had been framed by Greenglass. Jd. at 628. As a result, and only after\nGreenglass had passed away, the court concluded that Grenglass’ grand jury\ntestimony should be released since it provided information in a case of historical\ninterest to the public. Id. at 629 (holding that “the requested records are critical pieces\nof an important moment in our nation’s history’ and “the time for the public to guess\nwhat they contained should end.”). It is noteworthy that Judge Hellerstein refused\nto unseal the transcript while Grenglass was alive, finding that Greenglass’ interest\nin preserving the secrecy of his grand jury testimony “was sufficient to prevent its\nunsealing during his life, despite the public interest in the case.” Id. at 628.\n\nIn re Petition of American Historical Association involved a similar request by\nhistorical associations in l998 to unseal transcripts of two special grand juries\nconvened from l947 to l95o pertaining to the espionage investigation of Alger Hiss.\nInre Am. Hist. Ass'n, 49 F. Supp. 2d 274 (S.D.N.Y. l999). Hiss, a former high-ranking\nState Department official, was convicted of commiting perjury in responding to\nallegations that he was a Soviet spy. Hiss maintained his innocence until his death\nand publicly suggested that his prosecution was a political hit job by Richard Nixon\nto mobilize public <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to communism. Id. at 294. In granting the request to\nunseal the fifty-year old grand jury materials, the court noted the significant passage\n\nLSRETG MOSS\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o92", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 22 of 3l\npublic-record trial testimony of firsthand witnesses, and thus is not of significant historical or\npublic interest, there is arguably no charter for even undertaking the Jn re Craig inquiry. After\nall, the “special circumstances” exception to Rule 6(e) only applies in “exceptional\ncircumstances,” not to “garden variety” grand jury testimony. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3\n(citation omited); see also Gov’t Mem. at 3-4 (“acknouledg[ing] the extraordinary nature of\n[its] request”).\n\nNonetheless, for completeness, the Court evaluates the Government’s motion in light of\nthe non-exhaustive factors listed in Jn re Craig. The Court also addresses two other factors\nimplicated by the motion: the perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, as expressed in\nleters to the Court; and the systemic interest in grand jury secrecy.\n\nAs this assessment shous, the Government has failed, by a wide margin, to carry its\nburden. These factors, considered together, favor denial of its motion to unseal.\n\nl. Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThis factor ordinarily carries “great weight,” and “the government’s position should be\npaid considerable heed.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But the Government’s position is “not\ndispositive.” Jd. “(Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can government\n<span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> preclude it.” /d. And courts in this District, applying the Jn re Craig factors, have\nruled against the Government’s position. See In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d\nat 628-29 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony of two witnesses\nbefore grand jury that indicted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage); Jn re AHA, 49 F.\nSupp. 2d at 278, 297-98 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony before\ngrand juries that investigated and/or indicted Alger Hiss for espionage).\n\nThis factor favors disclosure. But for two reasons, the Court accords this factor limited\nweight.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 24 of 3l\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceedings or the\nGovernment Opposes Disclosure\n\nMaxwell opposes disclosure because, among other reasons, her case remains on direct\nappeal. Dkt. 8o3 at 2 (“Because this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.”’)\n\nThis factor thus weighs against unsealing. The Court, houever, assigns limited weight to\nthis factor because Maxwell, who does not have a legal right to access the grand jury materials,\nhas not seen it. Her <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> is therefore fairly viewed as precautionary. Had Maxwell been\naware that the grand jury materials are duplicative of information in the public record, her\nposition might have been different.\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThis factor addresses the present-day significance of the grand jury materials at issue and\nwhether their disclosure would advance the public interest. This factor so decisively weighs\nagainst unsealing that it alone would require denying the Government’s motion.\n\nArguments to disclose grand jury testimony on account of historical or public interest are\n“totally appropriate” and sometimes may even be weighty. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But for\nthe reasons reviewed above, the grand jury materials here are neither of historical nor public-\ninterest importance. This evidence was put before the grand juries in June 2o2o and March\n2o2l, in a case that remains on direct appeal. Cf In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp.\n3d at 628-29 (l95o grand jury testimony regarding Julius and Ethel Rosenberg); Jn re AHA, 49\nF. Supp. at 278, 297-98 (l947-l95o grand jury testimony regarding Alger Hiss). And it is not\nof present-day public importance because it consists of summary testimony by law enforcement\nagents recounting information that today is a mater of public record, on account of the month-\nlong trial on the charges returned by the grand jury. Cf In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 494 (grand jury\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l56", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019253.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 292774l, Pagel5 of l9\n\nthe United States may access the live audio feed by calling 2l4—4l6—o4oo and using\nthe same access code and PIN.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR- oool9334", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019345.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Page3 of 24\ninterlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the Order is neither a final\njudgment nor an appealable collateral order, and in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to Maxwell’s\nmotion to consolidate this appeal with the appeal pending in Giuffre v.

After all, the government itself moved to intervene and to stay all\nproceedings in Doe v. Indyke, a civil case in which Jane Doe alleges that Epstein and\nMs. Maxwell abused and exploited her as a minor.

(See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.) In her\nmotion, Maxwell set out the factors relevant to a stay analysis, and argued that not only her oun\ninterest, but also the interests of the courts, the public, and the other parties would be best served\nby the requested stay. (See generally id.)\n\nOn August 27, 2o2o, the Co-Executors submited a leter consenting to the entry of a stay\nand joining in Maxwell’s request that the stay apply to the entire proceeding. (See Leter to the\nCourt from Bennet J. Moskouitz, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr.”)\n\n(Dkt. 77).) The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay\nof this case (7.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiffs claims against Maxwell), as a\npartial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff's claims\nand would add unnecessary cost to the litigation. (See id., at l-2.) The Co-Executors also\npointed out that, if this mater were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a resolution of\nher claims through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Compensation Program’’)\nthat has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases\nbefore the Court to seek voluntary stays of their lawsuits. (See id., at 2-3.)\n\nBy leter dated August 27, 2o2o, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the requested stay, arguing\nthat the relevant factors weigh against granting the requested relief. (See generally Leter to the\nCourt from Robert Glassman, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Glassman Ltr.”) (Dkt. 78).)\nIn her <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, Plaintiff contended, inter alia, that Maxwell’s detention should pose no real\nimpediment to her defense of this action, suggesting that Maxwell, who filed her motion for a\nstay only after she had first sought discovery from Plaintiff in this case, “appear[ed] to want to\ngain an unfair advantage by acquiring as much information as she [could] about Plaintiff without\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9446", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019451.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODocemek Go, FICE DLIl H2dePavyess of l3\nout, both the Indictment in the criminal case and the Complaint in this action contain allegations\nthat Maxwell “groomed” minor victims by taking them to the movies or shopping, that Epstein\npaid for victims’ education, and that Maxwell facilitated Epstein’s abusive conduct. (See 8/l9/2o\nMenninger Ltr., at 3 (summarizing certain allegations made in both actions and noting that\nparticular allegations in the Indictment “are very similar in time frame and content to those in the\nComplaint’).) The Government, in its submission, has confirmed that the allegations pleaded in\nthis case will necessarily “touch on maters relating to the pending Indictment” (9/4/2o Gov’t\nLtr., at 2), and has also noted that “given the factual overlap between the civil and criminal cases,\nallouing the criminal mater to be resolved in the first instance may result in a narrouing of the\nfactual and legal issues before this Court” (id., at 3). Plaintiff, in her <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, does not contest\nthat there is substantial overlap between the cases, in terms of the people involved, the relevant\nevidence, or the facts sought to be established. (See generally 8/27/2o Glassman Ltr.) Thus, this\nfactor weighs in favor of granting a stay.\n2. Status of the Criminal Case\n\nThe arguments favoring a stay are also stronger where the criminal case is not merely\nhypothetical or anticipated, but rather is actively proceeding. In fact, as Maxwell notes,\n‘Tw hether the defendant has been indicted has been described as “the most important factor” to\nbe considered in the balance of factors.’” (8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at 4 (quoting Maldanado v.\nCity of New York, No. l7cv66l8 (AJN), 2ol8 WL 256lo26, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\nmaterials and grand jury information.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9879", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019904.jpg": "Casesb: 2o-8oo6 8oHAEN ISaCuMEent /222 FileensA3G/PtagPage 26ol9\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nRR anna\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- : 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. ;\npone ene nnn eee ee ee eX\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S REPLY MEMORANDUM\nIN FURTHER SUPPORT OF DETENTION\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this reply memorandum in further support of its\nmotion for detention, dated July 2, 2o2o (the “Detention Memorandum”) (Dkt. 4), and in response\nto the defendant’s memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> Memorandum’) (Dkt. l8).\n\nThe charges against Ghislaine Maxwell arise from her essential role in sexual exploitation\nthat caused deep and lasting harm to vulnerable victims. At the heart of this case are brave women\nwho are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to\nappreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as\nminors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from\nthese events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.\n\nThere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the\njurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.\nFor the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorandum, and as further discussed belou, the\ndefendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her\ncontinued appearance in this case. Among other concerns: (l) she is a citizen of a country that\ndoes not extradite its oun citizens; (2) she appears to have access to considerable wealth\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019909.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8oo88oHAEN ISShuMent 222 FileensA3G/PtagPagefs726ol9\ncharges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from\n2ool to 2oo7, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations\nof statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019917.jpg": "CaSade2Oter)d3GoouAunnt Bib eure 22o 2Fil e@ FAL) 26a deageot S OP l9\nthan any other inmate at the MDC, and thus she cannot claim any greater need for bail than the\nmany inmates awaiting trial there.*\n\nThe virus, of course, presents new and complex challenges for protecting inmates’ health,\nbut the BOP generally, and the MDC specifically, are prepared to handle the risks presented by\nCOVID-l9 and other health issues. The MDC’s response to the pandemic was the subject of\nextensive evidentiary hearings in the context ofa civil lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York.\nSee Chunn v.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo97", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020120.jpg": "Casmi@2O(c68oB3o.AobNt Docume W82l, FIEASB/2Bade6Rayel 2.nf 4\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR\nDecember l8, 2o2o, Paris.\nResponse to the government’s memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s renewed\nmotion for release.\nI was asked to review the United States government’s memorandum and notably pages l5 to\nl7 alongside the French Minister of Justice’s leter dated ll December 2o2o produced as\nExhibit B to this memorandum.\nl The French Minister of Justice’s leter (Exhibit B)\nThe leter of the French Minister of Justice, on which the US government relies to argue that\nthe French government does not extradite its citizens outside the European Union and thus to\nthe United States, quotes Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, which\nprovides that France can extradite \"any person not having French nationality”.\nIt remains unclear whether the author of such leter had actually access to my opinion which is\nnot even quoted, and more generally it seems the leter responds to a question which\nunexpectedly was not disclosed.\nThe leter fails to mention, houever, that Article 696 of the same Code provides that provisions\nof the French Code of Criminal Procedure on the conditions of extradition apply in the absence\nof an international agreement providing otherwise (Article 696 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure: “Jn the absence of an international agreement stipulating otherwise, the\nconditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this\nchapter'.

It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol24", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020138.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehRa3o/PtagPagefliss 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020164.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef 4 Ob 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span> to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020180.jpg": "CaSast: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePageBlGhl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial.

In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted.

On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

In addition,\nthe Court has determined it will conduct a Daubert hearing with respect to the\nDefendant's motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2. Because of the overlap in the\nsubstance of the motions, the Court will conduct the two proceedings back to back.\nThe Court previously set a tentative date for the Rule 4l2 Motion hearing as\nNovember 5, 2o2l.

The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered.

Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance.

These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure.” Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d\nCir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that\nDefendant's leter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and\nuseful in the judicial process,' thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of\nthe first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d\nl4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches. Id. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978).

In response, the parties\nhave submited leters to the Court indicating their differing views on whether Juror 5os\nmotion should be docketed at all. Upon further reflection, the Courtconcludes that it must\nfirst address the threshold question of whether an inquiry is permitedand/or required\nbefore considering Juror 5os requests.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No.\n58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\nredaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\nreference to the three-part test in Lugosch v.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior\nsexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.\nThe Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and\ncould serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation\nreport. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy\nTrial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2o22. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on\nthese counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations\nset forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22 leter.

See Dkt. No. 698. With one\nexception, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to\nprotect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 and the privacy interests of witnesses,\nincluding individuals subject to the Court's pseudonym order, and individuals who were\nanticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately called. See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\nredactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou redactions.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised redactions on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 7l2 from the docket. The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l Administrator Feldman's\nMotion to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\nDefendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's <span class=\"highlight\">Opposition</span> to Defendant's December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any\ndocuments not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.\nAny proposed redactions must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense.

The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering.

She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite <span class=\"highlight\">opposition</span>, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021345.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel73 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\n\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].””°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.7'©\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators.

The defense is\n7 in the best position to assess hou much time we need to perform\n8 our important function on behalf of our clients. I say that\n\n9 because we are not making a request for the purpose of simply\nlo delaying the proceedings. We are doing it because it is\n\nll actually necessary to accomplish our goals as counsel.\n\nl2 Also, which I did not reference in my leter, is it\n\nl3 also takes into account my trial schedule, at least why my\n\nl4 request was. Last week, I was scheduled to start a trial\n\nl5 before Judge Ramos in 4o Foley Square in July. And part of\n\nl6 what I discussed with Judge Ramos in seting that trial date\n\nl7 was that I knew that this trial may need to be accommodated in\nl8 some way. He selected July 2o for that date mostly because of\nl9 the court's availability at that time. That's also part of the\n2o reason. And in that particular case, my client's been\n2l incarcerated for almost two years. He is facing a mandatory\n22 life sentence. So I do need to spend some of my time geting\n23 ready for that as well, and I expect that to be our trial date.\n24 THE COURT: What's the date?\n25 MR.

(Dkt. No. 33) (“Mot.”). Thomas seeks an order\ncompelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable\nunder any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas’s motion is\nentirely without merit and should be denied.!\n\nThomas concedes that the Government has produced a “multitude” of discovery directly\nrelevant to the charges against him. (Mot. 6). Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the\nGovernment to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his\npurported defenses, namely, that he commited the offenses because of staffing issues and\nsupervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (l) a\ncopy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General\n(“DOJ-OIG”), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary\nmaterials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2ol9 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (i) reports\nand documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and other agencies who were not and\nare not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (il) reports and documents related to “any\nand all [Metropolitan Correctional Center (““MCC”)] employees” who have engaged in “the same\nor similar conduct,” including an incident in “2oo5 or 2oo6” where officers failed to conduct\ncounts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and\ndocuments related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP\n\n' Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas’s pretrial\nmotions.

Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense.
