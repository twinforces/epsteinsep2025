In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v.

Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000888.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagel2 of 25\n2l at l2 p.m. The Defendant's reply is due on Monday, August 24 at l2 p.m. The\nparties shall propose redactions to the leter briefing on this issue.

The Constitution’s “prohibitions on the deprivation of liberty\nwithout due process and of excessive bail require careful review of\npretrial detention orders to ensure that the statutory mandate [of the\nBail Reform Act] has been respected.” United States v. Motamedi, 767\nF.2d l4o38, l4o5 (9th Cir. l985) (Kennedy, J.). Because the consequence\nof error — the unjust deprivation of liberty from an individual who is\npresumed innocent — is contrary to our Constitution, “doubts regarding\nthe propriety of release should be resolved in favor of the defendant.” Id.\n\nEven where the government is able to prove that an accused is an\nactual flight risk, pretrial detention generally remains inappropriate.\nUnited States v. Berrios-Berrios, 79l F.2d 246, 25l (2d Cir. l986) (“the\npresumption in favor of bail sti// applies where the defendant is found to\nbe a risk of flight”) (emphasis added). Where the only question is\nwhether the defendant is a risk of flight, “the law still favors <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nrelease subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination\nof conditions, that the court determines will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo938\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000970.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAUR DSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA 872o Paget? of 26o\n\nThe government bears a dual burden in seeking <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> detention. First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001262.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd33ouAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3ie/2agPiagecs 66l8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">Pre-Trial</span> Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001267.jpg": "Casesb:2o-cr/oo8BOxAU At DOMED l/2o 2 Filedees/2G/PagPage 48l65l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nMarch l4\" 2o2l\n\nRe: Additional opinion on the extradition of nationals by the French government\n\nl. This memorandum was writen pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at\nthe French firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as\ncounsel for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell. The request was made in the context of ongoing bail\nproceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”),\nwhere Ms Maxwell is being detained <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> on charges relating to her alleged role in\nsexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from l994 to l997.\n\n2.

AsIunderstand the defendant’s French nationality continues to be regarded by the Court\nas a bar to her release pending trial, I am informed that the defendant is prepared to\nrenounce French nationality under Article 23-4 of the French Civil Code, if the Court\nso requires.\n\n4. Ina leter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2o2l, the Head of the International\nCriminal Assistance Bureau of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe Jaegle,\nasserts that the loss of French nationality after the criminal act which the person is\nalleged to have commited does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals,\nas nationality must be assessed at the time of commission of the offence and not at the\ntime of the extradition request.\n\n5. This report was writen to provide a counter opinion on this issue, in support of the\nproposition that the French government would be legally entitled to execute an\nextradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national.\n\n6.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose. . . a risk of flight.” See United States v.

As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline assistant on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release\non bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court\nDENIES the Defendant’s motion.\nIn light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that\nshould not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose\nany redactions to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by reference to\nthe Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir.\n2oo6). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted,\nthe Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.\nThis Order provides the botom line of the Court’s resolution. On July l4, 2o2o, this\nCourt conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> detention was warranted\nbecause the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance at future proceedings. Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if\nthe Court finds “that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo223o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo4 Filed l2/28/2o Page 2 of 2\nnone of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a\nmaterial bearing on the Court’s determination that she poses a flight risk.\n\nFurthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention\nwas warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release\ncan reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings. In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> detention continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at 3o-33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002334.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l27 Filed ol/26/2l Page l of l\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ce\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED: l/o6/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Government agrees that no redactions are necessary\nas to those particular motions. The Government agrees with the defendant’s proposed redactions\nto the remaining <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions for the follouing reasons:\n\ne The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss for breach of the non-\nprosecution agreement (Motion l) and the motion to dismiss for pre-indictment\ndelay (Motion 7) refer to documents designated by the Government as\n“Confidential” within the meaning of the Protective Order in this case (see\nProtective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36)), and the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the integrity of the Government’s ongoing investigation.

See\nDkt. No. l27. The Government responded that it did not oppose the Defendant’s proposed\nredactions, but with respect to her motion to suppress under the Due Process Clause (Motion 3),\nthe Government requested a limited set of additional redactions in order to be consistent with the\nother proposed redactions.

The Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are\n“Judicial documents;” (ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the\nmaterials; and (ill) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at\nll9-2o. “Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nT.

Prejudice Resulting from Prejudicial Media Reporting and Inappropriate\n<span class=\"highlight\">Pre-Trial</span> Publicity.\n\nBeginning in 2oo5 and escalating in 2oll through the present, Ms. Maxwell has been a\npotential target of a group of personal injury lawyers who made millions of dollars suing Jeffrey\nEpstein or extorting those associated with him. The playbook was relatively simple: File\nincendiary pleadings in court to avoid defamation claims; provide the pleadings and background\ninformation to various media organizations; obtain alleged victim’s names and police reports\nfrom law enforcement; share information with potential claimants who hire the lawyers after\nreading or hearing the reports; file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein; get money from Mr. Epstein or\nassociates to setle; repeat. Once Mr. Epstein had setled all of these claims against himself and\nthe other individuals alleged to have been involved, a new play was necessary - try to invalidate\nthe NPA; and at the same time drum up litigation against Maxwell with the expectation that\neither Mr. Epstein would setle any new litigation to avoid being dragged into yet another case\nthat would further tarnish the reputation he was trying to rebuild or result in money directly from\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nFrom 2oll to 2ol9, Ms. Maxwell was the subject of millions of media stories, posts,\nblogs, podcasts, and comments that simply republished the same allegations that she correctly\nidentified as “obvious lies” in 2ol5. Once New York passed L. 2ol9, ch. ll, knoun as the Child\nVictims Act, the door was open to claimants who wanted to take advantage of Mr. Epstein’s\nvulnerability to file new lawsuits on stale allegations. At that point it easy to make copycat\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002742.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l62 Filed o2/26/2l Page l of 2\nGas U.S. Department of Justice\noe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. 25). The Court agreed to move those deadlines by three\nweeks because the government needed additional time to finish producing discovery. (Dkt. 72).\nUnder the revised briefing schedule, the defendant’s pretrial motions were due on January ll,\n2o2o, the government’s response was due February l2, 2o2l, and the defendant’s reply was due\non February l9, 2o2l.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its omnibus memorandum of law opposing\nDefendants’ twelve <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions. It filed the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits,\nunder temporary seal pending the Court’s resolution of its request to redact sensitive or\nconfidential information. See Dkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to\ncertain of the redactions that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional\nredactions. Having considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the\nGovernment’s requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant’s additional\nredaction requests, with the exceptions discussed belou.\n\nTo begin with, the Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under\nthis test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial\ndocuments;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials;\nand (i) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o.\n“Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd. at\nl2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (““Amodeo I?’)).\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002763.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 2 of 5\n\nThe proposed redactions mostly satisfy this test. First, the Government’s brief in\nopposition to the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions is a “judicial document” for purposes of the first\nelement of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir.\nl995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First Amendment\npresumption of access. /d. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrouly tailored to\nserve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access.\n\nLike the Government’s previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the\nGovernment bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are necessary to\nprotect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties’ personal\nprivacy interests. As a general mater, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for\novercoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d\n46o, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the\nGovernment’s brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit l contains a single redaction—the\nname of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual’s personal privacy interests\noutweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The\nproposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only\nthe names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety\nand privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that ataches to those\ndocuments.\n\nThe Court overrules the Defendant’s objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5\nof the Government’s brief and adopts the Government’s proposed redactions. The core of the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 5 of l2\nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense\nspecifically enumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or\ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the\ncommunity or others. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“[A] defendant must\nintroduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).\nNonetheless, “‘the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing\nevidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’” English, 629 F.3d at\n3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”’).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring\ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo277l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 6 of l2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page8ofl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">Pre-Trial</span> Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page l3oofl8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nMarch l4\" 2o2l\n\nRe: Additional opinion on the extradition of nationals by the French government\n\nl. This memorandum was writen pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at\nthe French firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as\ncounsel for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell. The request was made in the context of ongoing bail\nproceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”),\nwhere Ms Maxwell is being detained <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> on charges relating to her alleged role in\nsexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from l994 to l997.\n\n2. Ina previous opinion, I have outlined why French authorities could decide to execute\nan extradition request against a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between the\nUSA and France, without violating any superior norm of French and international law.\n\n3. AsIunderstand the defendant’s French nationality continues to be regarded by the Court\nas a bar to her release pending trial, I am informed that the defendant is prepared to\nrenounce French nationality under Article 23-4 of the French Civil Code, if the Court\nso requires.\n\n4. Ina leter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2o2l, the Head of the International\nCriminal Assistance Bureau of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe Jaegle,\nasserts that the loss of French nationality after the criminal act which the person is\nalleged to have commited does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals,\nas nationality must be assessed at the time of commission of the offence and not at the\ntime of the extradition request.\n\n5. This report was writen to provide a counter opinion on this issue, in support of the\nproposition that the French government would be legally entitled to execute an\nextradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national.\n\n6.

App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F.

Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553\n(S.D.N.Y. l995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seek production of\ndocuments or other materials which, although not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible\nevidence,” criminal “Rule l7(c) cannot be used to obtain leads as to the existence of additional\ndocumentary evidence or to seek information relating to the defendant’s case” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must demonstrate:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\n: A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF. The Court, houever, should exercise its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See\nUnited States v. Weissman, No. ol Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2oo2) (“Rule l7(c) expressly commits the decision whether to require <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> production of\ndocuments to the sound discretion of the court.”). Should the Court wish to hear further from BSF\nprior to deciding the Motion, BSF is prepared to appear before the Court and/or move to intervene\nand to quash the Subpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002935.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l of 239\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neon nn nn en eX\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- i Sl 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n222-2 -- +--+ +--+ +--+ + eX\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S OMNIBUS MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION\nTO THE DEFENDANT?’S <span class=\"highlight\">PRE-TRIAL</span> MOTIONS\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nUnited States Atorney\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nAtorney for the United States of America\nAlison Moe\nMaurene Comey\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n- Of Counsel -\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2935\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002962.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 239\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nwenn een en eee eX\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n\n-V.- i Sl 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\n\nDefendant. :\nre rere e E\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s\ntwelve <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions, dated January 25, 2o2l (the “Defense Motions”). In her pretrial motions,\nthe defendant seeks to throu everything but the proverbial kitchen sink at the Indictment, raising\nmyriad arguments that find litle support in fact or law. For the reasons that follou, the motions\nshould be denied in their entirety.\n\nFirst, the non-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida is entirely irrelevant to this case, and the defendant’s\nmotion fails as a mater of law. Second, the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which\nprovides an extended statute of limitations for crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors. The\ndefendant’s statute of limitations arguments run contrary to the text of the statute, the intent of\nCongress, and the weight of authority. Third, the defendant’s claim that the Government delayed\nin bringing the indictment fails as a mater of law and fact. Fourth, both of the defendant’s motions\nto suppress evidence obtained through a judicially approved subpoena are meritless, and her\nallegations of Government misconduct are baseless. Fifth, Counts Five and Six—which charge\nthe defendant with commiting perjury—are properly pleaded, and the defendant’s motion to\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 239\nto the instant prosecution, is insufficient to shou actual prejudice. .. . The fact that evidence may\nbe lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment stage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the\nduration. Furthermore, there has been no allegation in this case that the destruction of the records\nwas deliberate on the part of either the government or trustee.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nLastly, the defendant contends that prejudicial media reporting and inappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\npublicity from at least 2oll through the present has resulted in prejudice to the defendant. (Def.\nMot. at l4). She claims that had the Government brought charges against her between l996 and\n2oll, the Government “would have not prevailed,” noting that the defendant’s accusers would not\nhave been “able to conform their ‘memories’ to the often republished ‘obvious lies.’” (/d. at l5).\nThis argument, like the others contained in this motion, is steeped in speculation. The defendant\ncites not one case in support of her argument that <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> publicity can ever establish actual\nprejudice, nor does she point to any evidence that the Government fomented such publicity dating\nback to 2oll. To the extent the defendant is concerned about pretrial publicity, she will have the\nopportunity to propose an appropriate examination of potential jurors during voir dire to identify\na panel of impartial jurors who have not been prejudiced by any publicity this case may have\ngarnered.\n\nIn short, the defendant’s complaints are nothing more than the type of self-serving, vague,\nspeculative, and conclusory claims of prejudice that courts have consistently rejected as\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment delay.'!? The motion should\ntherefore be denied.\n\n'° The defendant also complains about the Government’s failure to “provide discovery adequate\nto fully investigate the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 7). Among the\nitems the defense complains about not receiving in discovery are the names and dates of birth of\nthe Minor Victims, the specific location of any overt act, the date of any overt act, any witness\nstatements, or any corroboration of any allegation in the Indictment. (/d.). As described herein,\nsee Section X, infra, the Government has made substantial discovery productions pursuant to Rule\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003111.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel77 of 239\n\nVII. The Indictment Contains the Elements of Each Offense and Provides the Defendant\n\nMore Than Adequate Notice of the Charges Against Her\n\nThe defendant also moves to dismiss Counts One through Four on the grounds that the\nIndictment lacks specificity because it does not name minor victims, does not include specific\ndates, and uses language that the defendant claims not to understand. (Def. Mot. l2). The motion\nis meritless and should be denied. The plain language of the Indictment clearly and sufficiently\nsets forth every element of each crime charged, and the extensive details contained in the\nIndictment as further amplified through the voluminous discovery and the Government’s various\n<span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> filing describing the case and its anticipated proof at trial provide the defendant with more\nthan sufficient notice of the charges against her.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nIt is well-established that “[a]n indictment is sufficient if it contains the elements of the\noffense(s) charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge(s) against which he must\ndefend.” United States v.

As a result, “‘an indictment need do litle\nmore than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate\nterms) of the alleged crime’” in order to be sufficient. United States v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686,\n693 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting United States v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d Cir. l975)).

The mere existence of a confidentiality agreement or a protective order\ncovering judicial documents is insufficient to overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi\nNissay Doua Ins. Co. v.

United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worm\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n‘“‘Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v.

The Government thus is not asking\n\nfor a straightforward application of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant\n\nextension of it to a distinct category of information.\n\nId. at 22l9. Second, the Court concluded that in “in no meaningful sense” did Carpenter\nvoluntarily “assume the risk” of “turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical\nmovements.” /d. at 222o.\n\nThe same logic applies here. There is “world of difference between the limited types of\npersonal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive” and personal details\nabout Maxwell that are contained in Boies Schiller’s 9o,ooo pages of confidential material.\nThese details include, for example, information about Maxwell’s sexual partners, sexual habits,\nfinances, and much, much more.\n\nMoreover, “in no meaningful sense” did Maxwell voluntarily share this information with\nBoies Schiller. Giuffre sued Maxwell, not the other way around. And the defamation claim (the\nonly claim Giuffre ever asserted against Maxwell, who did not file a counterclaim) had nothing\nto do with much of the confidential information Maxwell was forced, over objection, to provide.\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts for lack of materiality and her motion for\nseverance, and the replies in support thereof, explain this in more detail. Maxwell <span class=\"highlight\">Pre-Trial</span> Mot.\nNos. 4 & 5.\n\nBut the point is this: The defamation case should have been extremely narrou, but Boies\nSchiller transformed it into something much broader—a proxy prosecution of Epstein and\nMaxwell for allegedly trafficking and abusing Giuffre, which then compelled Maxwell, over\nobjection, to answer irrelevant and highly prejudicial personal questions.

This testimony is, in any case, far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to\nthe dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell.

Maxwell is entitled to appeal that detention determination, and she is exercising that\nright. But it does not follou that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail\ndeterminations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of\nthe Government’s case is tested. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are\npermissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.\nLaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). Before making its prior bail determinations, the\nCourt scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government’s proffer and concluded that\nthe proffered case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government’s case will be tested at\ntrial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case\nproceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and\nall relevant circumstances. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the\npublic and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See l8 U.S.C.\n§3l6l(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act provides a right “to proceedings free\nfrom unreasonable delay.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nThis leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell’s request\nfor an adjournment. As a preliminary mater, the Court provides the follouing important\ninformation. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July l2, 2o2l, currently\nthe precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of\nthe presiding judge. SDNY is still operating under special protocols for jury selection during the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. Because of a limited number of reconfigured courtrooms and spaces large\nenough to hold jury selection and trial safely, the protocols centralize the scheduling of access to\njuries and reconfigured courtrooms pursuant to an established protocol for trial priority.

For example, criminal jury trials requesting a\nparticular jury selection date are given priority over civil jury trials requesting that same date.\nCriminal trials involving detained defendants are given priority over criminal trials in which\ndefendants are not detained <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>. Among detained defendants, cases that set trial dates prior\nto March l6, 2o2o get priority. For any detained defendants whose trial date was set after March\nl6, 2o2o, priority is based upon who has been detained the longest. Absent a grant of an\nadjournment, by May l5, the Court will request a jury selection date as close to July l2, 2o2l as\npossible. Once a jury selection date is assigned by the Clerk’s Office, that date is firm. As of\nnou, the parties should presume that trial will commence on a date close to July l2 (depending\non trial demand and the order of priority) and plan accordingly.\n\nWith this information in mind, the Court seeks confirmation and express clarification\nfrom defense counsel for three reasons. First, Maxwell’s request for an adjournment came\nbefore the Court ruled on the pending motions, including the Court’s granting of Maxwell’s\nrequest to sever the perjury counts. Trial on the non-perjury counts will proceed first, which will\nshorten preparations for and the length of trial on the non-perjury counts. Second, Maxwell’s\nrequest was ambiguous as to the length of adjournment being requested. As noted, the leter\nargued a 9o-day adjournment was necessary but also suggested that some number of her defense\ncounsel would not be available until January 2o22. And third, by this Order the Court denies\nMaxwell’s request for a renewed bail hearing.

Maxwell,” the\nproduction from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law enforcement entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6. The peculiar failure of the government to produce these items\nin connection with the “entire” BSF file has yet to be explained. Clearly, BSF knew what the\nterms meant when it used them to block the production of this information in the civil litigation\nand it should not be alloued to profess confusion or ignorance here.\n\nThe cases cited by BSF are not helpful to its cause. For example, the court in United\nStates v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o),\nquashed the subpoena because it did “not satisfy the initial requirement of relevance.” In United\nStates v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), the defendant requested\n“any and all writings and records” related to the NYPD's contact with a particular confidential\nwitness who, according to the defendant, provided relevant information. The subpoena was\nunlimited in time or scope and, to the extent a time or scope were determined, production of the\ninformation was limited by l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. Jd. at 5l3.\n\nUnited States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4 CR l86 SCR, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2oo8), involved a subpoena served by the Defendant on the Metropolitan Detention\n?

The trial involves\nthree defendants, two of whom are currently serving federal sentence, six charged and two dozen\nuncharged murders. The government has estimated 6-8 weeks of trial, but because the trial is\nsubject to special protocols for jury selection during COVID, and the defendants and most of the\nwitnesses are Spanish speakers and require the assistance of interpreters, counsel believes that\nthe trial may extend beyond eight (8) weeks and, if not moved, could extend until January 2o22.\nAll defense counsel but one in J are amenable to a postponement; the remaining co-\ncounsel cannot commit due to a late January trial date also before Judge Furman, which may\nresolve <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>. If Judge Furman is amenable to pushing the October 4 trial to follou this trial,\nMs. Maxwell’s trial could begin November 8, 2o2l.\n\nB. Comparison of the Sl and S2 Indictments\n\nWith the S2 indictment, the government significantly expanded the scope of this\nprosecution. The original indictment, and the first superseding indictment, charged a four-year\nconspiracy with two alleged co-conspirators. The second superseding indictment adds seven\nyears to the scope of the alleged conspiracy.

Other than through\nconclusory speculation, she fails to explain hou the contents of those leters may be relevant to\nher theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the\nextent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce\nthem in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is litle more than an atempt to\ncircumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not\nyet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents\nconsistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion &\nOrder resolving some of Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions, the Government has represented in good\nfaith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to\ncomply with them.

Dkt. No. l87. These additions will require the defense to (l)\nreview a substantial amount of discovery that is nou potentially relevant as a result of the S2\nIndictment; (2) re-review discovery that it had previously considered in light of the changes to\nthe case against her; (3) conduct new investigations based on the new charges, including\npotential interviews of new witnesses; and (4) re-evaluate her trial preparation and strategy.\nSecond, although jury trials have resumed in the district and conditions in MDC and around the\ncountry are improving, the defendant’s and defense counsel’s preparation efforts to date have\nbeen and to some extent continue to be hampered by the effects of the COVID-l9 pandemic. As\nthe Government indicated in explaining the delay in filing the new charges, travel constraints and\nother safety concerns resulting from the pandemic have sloued trial preparation and complicated\nthe logistics of conducting investigations.

Third, defense counsel must\nbalance preparing for trial with considering and preparing any supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions in\nresponse to the new charges contained in the S2 Indictment. Although the perjury counts were\nrecently severed, the Court cannot conclude that this sufficiently offsets the additional burdens\nplaced on the defense as a result of the new charges and expanded timeframe resulting from the\nS2 indictment.\n\nThe Court is very mindful of the countervailing considerations that require that any\nadjournment be no longer than necessary.

And,\nimportantly, any victims and the public more broadly have a strong interest in trial proceeding\nwithout undue delay. It is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case proceed to that trial as\nexpeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and all relevant\ncircumstances. See l8 U.S.C. §3l6l(h)(7)(A); l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nHaving balanced all of the factors outlined above, the Court concludes that the interests\nof justice justify granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2o2l\nto be reasonable.

For the reasons that\nfollou, and for the reasons set forth in the Government’s memorandum in opposition to the\ndefendant’s twelve <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions, dated February 26, 2o2l, and the Court’s Opinion and Order,\ndated April l6, 2o2l (Dkt. No. 2o7, the “April Opinion” or “Apr. Op.”), the Defense Motions\nshould be denied in their entirety.\nFirst, the non-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida does not apply to this District and does not bar the\nprosecution of the defendant. Second, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the\nprosecution of the defendant, who has never previously risked conviction for the sex trafficking\noffenses contained in Counts Five and Six of Indictment S2 2o Cr. 33o (the “S2 Indictment’).\nThird, Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment, which plainly involve the sexual abuse of minors,\nare timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which provides an extended statute of limitations for such\ncrimes. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government delayed in bringing the S2 Indictment\nfails as a mater of law and fact. Fifth, the defendant’s motion to dismiss certain conspiracy counts\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Pagel7 of 26\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s previous briefing (Dkt. No. 2o4\nat 23-36), and for the reasons set forth in the Court’s April Opinion (Apr. Op. at 9-l6), the\nprosecution of Counts Five and Six is timely.\nIV. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the S2 Indictment Based on Alleged Improper\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Pre-Trial</span> Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should dismiss the S2 Indictment because the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing the charges violates her due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 22). In\nmaking this motion, the defendant asks the Court to provide such relief for the “same reasons\ndiscussed in her prior motion” (Def. Mot. at 22)—reasons this Court already considered and\nrejected. This Court evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and concluded\nthat the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a claim that any\nalleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Apr. Op. at l7). “To prevail on a\nclaim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a defendant must shou both that the\nGovernment intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the delay\nseriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the charges.” (Apr. Op. at l7 (citing\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999))).°\n\nAs to the element of actual and substantial prejudice, the Court found that the defendant\ndid “not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support” her claim. (Apr. Op. at l7).\nThe Court concluded that the defendant “failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges,” rejecting the defendant’s “highly speculative”\narguments that the death of certain potential witnesses, failing memories, or lost records prejudiced\n® Moreover, “[w]here an indictment is brought within the statute of limitations, there is a\npresumption that the [defendant] was not prejudiced.” Van Stuyvesant v. Conway, No. o3 Civ.\n3856 (LAK), 2oo7 WL 2584775, at *42 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2oo7) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited); see also Apr. Op. at l7. As this Court previously found, and as detailed above,\nthe “applicable statute of limitations” does not “bar[] the charges here.” (Apr. Op. at l8).\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l8 of 26\n\nher interests or would have made a “substantial difference” in her case. (/d. at l7). In her current\nmotion, the defendant offers no additional factual claims in support of her argument that the\npassage of time has prejudiced her defense. She instead refers the Court back to her prior\nhypothetical, vague, and conclusory claims of prejudice that do not withstand scrutiny. The\ndefendant has not remotely carried her “heavy burden” of proof. Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. Her\nrenewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment\ndelay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nBecause the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the\ndefendant’s specious arguments that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment\ndelay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. See United States v. Pierre-\nLouis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). In any event, in\ndenying the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions filed in January, the Court noted the absence of\n“evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Apr. Op. at l7). That remains true.\n\nThe defendant argues that the “S2 Indictment only compounds [the excessive pre-\nindictment delay] issues by charging additional offenses based on alleged conduct that the\ngovernment has knoun about since in or about 2oo7, which it added for tactical reasons to shore\nup its case against Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment acted in bad faith—to the extent she is making such an argument—is based on no\nevidence whatsoever, and for good reason: it is not true.\n\nAs the Government has previously explained (see Dkt. No. l99), the Government obtained\nthe S2 Indictment—which added counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor\nvictim, Minor Victim-4—based on new evidence that was not available to the Government at the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3o of 8o\n\nAs further support for the view that no agreement was reached, nor any promise\nextended, the trial court noted that, in his initial statement to police, which was voluntarily\nprovided and not under oath, Cosby did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. Instead,\nCosby presented a narrative of a consensual sexual encounter with Constand, which he\nasserted again later in his depositions. “Thus,” the trial court explained, “there was\nnothing to indicate that [Cosby’s] cooperation would cease if a civil case were filed.” /d.\nat 65. Since Cosby previously had discussed the incident without invoking his right to\nremain silent, the court found no reason to believe that Cosby subsequently would do so\nin a civil case so as to necessitate the remedy that the former district atorney purported\nto provide in anticipation of that litigation.\n\nThe trial court further held that, even if there was a purported grant of immunity,\nCosby could not insist upon its enforcement based upon the contractual theory of\npromissory estoppel, because “any reliance on a press release as a grant of immunity\nwas unreasonable.” /d. Specifically, the court noted that Cosby was represented at all\ntimes by a competent team of atorneys, but none of them “obtained [D.A.] Castor’s\npromise in writing or memorialized it in any way.” /d. at 65-66. The failure to demand\nwriten documentation was evidence that no promise not to prosecute was ever extended.\nFor these reasons, the trial court found no legal basis to estop the Commonwealth from\nprosecuting Cosby.\n\nCosby filed a notice of appeal and a petition for review with the Superior Court. In\nresponse to the filings, the Superior Court temporarily stayed the proceedings belou.\nHouever, upon a motion by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court quashed the appeal\nand lifted the stay. This Court likewise rejected Cosby’s <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> efforts to appeal the\nadverse rulings, denying his petition for allouance of appeal, his petition for review, and\nhis emergency petition for a stay of the proceedings.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4842\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004962.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l5 _ Filed o7/3o/2l Pagellof3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT Sree ieee\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: //3o/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Dkt. No. 3o9.\n\nMr. Markus is plainly a lawyer associated with the defense in this case. His formal\nrepresentation has involved handling at least one <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> issue for Ms. Maxwell—in particular,\nappeals to the Second Circuit of this Court’s bail-denial determinations. Dkt. No. l73; see also\nUnited States v. Maxwell, Nos. 2l-58-cr(L), 2l-77o-cr (2d Cir.). Beyond that, he has held\nhimself out as Ms. Maxwell’s atorney in press related to the current trial stage, including in the\nop-ed at issue in the Government’s leter application, which describes him as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” He has also atended a proceeding in this mater and spoken on Ms.\nMaxwell’s behalf to the press afterwards while identified as Ms. Maxwell’s atorney. See\nStephen Rex Broun, Ghislaine Maxwell Makes First In-Person NYC Court Appearance, N.Y.\nDaily News (Apr. 23, 2o2l), htps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-ghislaine-maxwell-\narraignment-2o2 lo423-b3azaSeh7bddna7r247px2yb7e-story.html.\n\nNevertheless Mr. Markus argues that he is not subject to Rule 23.l because he does not\ncurrently represent Ms. Maxwell in any proceedings and has not made an appearance in this\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l5 Filed o7/3o/2l Page2of3\nCourt. Dkt. No. 3l4. Rule 23.l is not so superficial nor easily circumvented. Nothing in the\nrule limits its application to lawyers who have formally noticed an appearance. To the contrary,\nas the text throughout the rule makes clear, it applies to statements made by lawyers (and others)\n“associated” with “pending or imminent criminal litigation.” S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule\n23.l(a) (last updated Oct. 29, 2ol8); see also Rule 23.l(b) (“a lawyer participating in or\nassociated with the investigation’); Rule 23.l(c) (“lawyer or law firm associated with the\nprosecution or defense”). An atorney need not be of record in order to be sufficiently\n“associated” with a case as to justify application of disciplinary rules regarding extrajudicial\nstatements. Lawyers who have not filed a formal notice of appearance may still possess\ninformation that lends a perception by the public that their remarks on a pending case hold\ngreater authority. See In re Hinds, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (N.J. l982); see also People v. Butafuoco,\n599 N.Y.S.2d 4l9 (Nassau Cty. Ct. l993).\n\nSuch is the case with Mr. Markus’s role in the pending mater. As noted, Mr. Markus has\natended a proceeding in this Court, after which he spoke to the press on Ms. Maxwell’s behalf.\nHe has represented Ms. Maxwell on appeals of this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> bail determinations.\nMoreover, Mr. Markus has identified himself as Ms. Maxwell’s appellate lawyer in a published\nop-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case. These facts mean that the public, which\nincludes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an authoritative source of information\nregarding the pending mater and may readily consider his remarks to be accurate and reliable.\nMr. Markus is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and\nthe Court declines to consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity\nwith respect to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule.

Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472 (PAC), 2o2l\nWL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6, 2o2l). And while the requested subpoenas are limited to\nthe period between 2ol5 and 2o2l, the timeframe is still overly broad. Here, too, the requests\nare precisely the kind of “fishing expedition” that the specificity requirement is designed to\nprevent. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 3-4; Bouman Dairy Co., 34l U.S. at 22l.\nIndeed, the requests are akin to discovery requests in civil litigation. See United States v.\nAvenati, No. (Sl) l9-CR-373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o). But\nRule l7(c) subpoenas are not tools of discovery. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698; United States v. Wey,\n252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 253 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). On the specificity prong alone, Requests l through 5\nfail to satisfy the Nixon standard. They also fail because there is no plausible theory of relevance\nto these requests, and the briefing papers advance no discernible explanation for why these\ndocuments may be relevant at trial. The papers suggest that part of the impetus for the requests\nrelate to impeachment, but that is insufficient to warrant issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek “any” notes, reports, records or summaries reflecting any meetings\nor communications between Subpoena Recipient-3 and Subpoena Recipient-4 and certain\nvictims or their counsel. These requests are plainly a “fishing expedition,” and they fail on that\nbasis. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698. In any event, and more generally, the requests do not satisfy\nNixon’s relevance requirement. Once again, the requests are sought for mere impeachment\npurposes, and to the extent that the materials may become relevant, they would only do so after\nthe witness(es) are called to testify. A <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper mechanism\nfor procuring such impeachment materials. Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2.

The Court Should Reject the Government’s Atempts to Preview any Defense\n\nCase or Cross Examination\n\nUnless and until the prosecution has established its prima facie case, the defendant “‘is not\ncalled upon to determine whether to produce documents and material normally privileged. It\nimposes a price on the exercise of a constitutional right to require a <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> decision of the trial\ntactics which are normally determined by a defense lawyer follouing the completion of the\nprima facie case.” United States v. Fratello, 44 F.R.D. 444, 452 (S.D.N-Y. l968). Moreover, the\ndecision to prosecute someone criminally carries with it certain consequences:\n\nUnder our constitutional system, a criminal defendant—need not do anything at all\n\nto defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.\n\nRather he has an absolute, unqualified right to compel the State to investigate its\n\noun case, find its oun witnesses, prove its oun facts, and convince the jury through\n\nits oun resources. Throughout the process the defendant has a fundamental right to\n\nremain silent, in effect challenging the State at every point to: “Prove it!”\n\nUnited States v. Wilkerson, 388 F. Supp. 3d 969, 972 (E.D. Tenn. 2ol9) (quoting Williams v.\nFlorida, 399 U.S. 78, ll2 (l97o) (Black, J., dissenting)).\n\nMuch of the government’s argument is directed at causing the defense to provide a\npreview of its strategy and the substance of defense cross examination which should be rejected\nby the Court.\n\nI. THE GOVERNMENT’S PSEUDONYM TACTIC IS UNNECESSARY,\n\nUNWORKABLE, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THIS CASE\n\nThe government proposes various false or partial names for some of the accusers and\nwitnesses. The request is not supported by any factual declaration. No evidence exists suggesting\nthat any witness has been or would be threatened by Ms. Maxwell. None of the witnesses are\nee\nEEE\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 69\nI. SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone associated with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. <span class=\"highlight\">PRE-TRIAL</span> RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way. Mot. at l7. Under the government's\napparent view, any credibility challenge will permit any prior statement of the government's\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)). The effect of the 2ol4 Amendment then, as\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 69\nthe Second Court explained, was to allou for such statements to be admited \"substantively as\nwell,\" rather than as non-substantive rehabilitation. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (amendment \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain applicable post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s amendment in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement. In Zome, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 5l of 69\n6l2-l3; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42. Accordingly, this evidence does not impermissibly question\nthe government’s motives and should not be precluded.\n\nV. A <span class=\"highlight\">PRE-TRIAL</span> BAN ON CHALLENGES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF NON-\n\nTESTIFYING WITNESSES IS UNSUPPORTED LEGALLY OR FACTUALLY\n\nThe government again refrains from telling the Court exactly what evidence it expects at\ntrial, yet asks the defense to preview its possible cross-examination or defense-case evidence, in\norder both to circumvent the Rules of Criminal Procedure's guidelines and this Court's orders as\nto when the defense must disclose certain evidence. What's more, the government gives only\nsummary suggestions of what the evidence \"might\" be and then asks the Court to rule\ndefinitively that the defense is precluded from challenging that evidence via cross-examination\nor otherwise. Because this Court cannot rule on the admissibility of impeachment evidence of a\nnon-testifying witness unless and until the government actually elicits testimony concerning such\na witness, this motion should be denied or deferred until the appropriate time at trial.\n\nThe government does a poor job of previewing exactly what statements it anticipates\noffering from others related i\n\nP| It says that \"other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities” of\nthose two non-testifying witnesses, \"including [unspecified] statements by them,\" which\nstatements according to the government \"will not include any statements ... offered for the truth\nof the mater asserted or under one of the other exceptions listed under Rule 8o6.\" Mot. at 37-38.\nThe government then gives two non-exclusive examples”? but fails to elucidate what exactly the\npertinent statements will be, to wit:\n© The government does not give any examples pertaining to PR\ntherefore it is wholly unclear what statements the government intends to elicit about her or for what\npurpose.

The ill-founded\nmotion should be denied.\n\nA. The Government Cites No Authority for Requiring <span class=\"highlight\">Pre-trial</span> Notice of Such\n\nEvidence.\n\nAt the outset, this Court can deny the government’s motion for a simple reason: There is\nno authority requiring Ms. Maxwell to provide the government with notice of the evidence she\nintends to offer at trial. To the contrary, when such notice is required, the Rules of Evidence or\nProcedure make the requirement express. Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b), for example,\nimposes a duty on Ms. Maxwell to make certain disclosures, particularly as they regard expert\nwitnesses and opinions. But the Rule does not require her to identify evidence of her “absence\nwhen Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s case-in-chief” and then\n“explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.”\n\nNor does Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) require notice from the defendant. In fact, the\ngovernment’s invocation of Rule 4o4(b) actually undermines its motion. In a criminal case, that\nRule imposes on the government a duty to provide advance notice of any other-acts evidence it\ndesires to admit at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).°? The Rule does not impose a similar obligation\non a defendant.\n\n° The Rule says:\n\nIn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so\n\nthat the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the\n\nevidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause, excuses\n\nlack of pretrial notice.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3) (emphasis added).\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\nrelevance of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., charitable\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any\nsuch evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl2\nrejected by the Court which ordered disclosure at the same time as the government's witness list,\nRule 4o4(b) notice, exhibits, and 35oo materials no later than October ll, 2o2l, so that the\nDefense would not be surprised at trial and because of “the need for the parties to litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial....”” Dkt. 335 at 3.\n\nThe government seized multiple electronic devices, including computers and servers\nfrom alleged co-conspirator Epstein. These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl2\n\nAfter December 2o2o, according to the Advisory Commitee, the new subsection (B)\nrequires that:\n\nThe prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer\n\npursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the\n\nevidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in\n\nlight of this purpose.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\nanticipated evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 5242.l 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (2o2l).\n\nII. Rule 4o4(b) Notice in This Case\n\nThe Government advised this Court that it could provide notice of any Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence by 45 days prior to trial, which would afford it \"adequate time to finalize its\ndetermination of what evidence it will seek to introduce at trial pursuant to\" the Rule. See Dkt.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005618.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl2\nthe admissibility of the other act evidence.\" Wright & Miller, supra. Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See\nDkt. 297.\n\nThere is no acceptable excuse for failure to follou the requirements of the Rule.

Ms. Maxwell Needs Additional Time to Respond to the Scant Notice that the\n\nMaterials Qualify as “Direct Evidence” in the Case\n\nThe Rule 4o4(b) Leter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed\nmaterials qualify as \"direct evidence\" of the conspiracy. At first blush, it is hard to see hou they\ncould so qualify. |\nee\nWm They do not reference or have anything to do with (a) the persons mentioned in the\nIndictment or any other testifying witness, nor (b) any of the legal allegations contained in the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 59 of 84\n\nOn September 3, 2o2l, the Court ordered the Government to “disclose to the Defendant\nthe identities of all unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment to whom it will refer at\ntrial.” (Order at l, Dkt.

The Court further ordered the Government to “disclose all co-\nconspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this\nCourt’s scheduling order.” (/d. at 2).\n\nAccordingly, on October ll, 2o2l, the Government produced its exhibit list and Jencks\nAct material to the defendant.

When the Court first set a\ndisclosure schedule for Jencks Act material, it adopted the “Government’s proposal,” which\nopposed any requirement that the Government isolate co-conspirator statements from other witness\nstatements. (Order at l, Dkt. No. 297). When the Court ordered the Government to produce the\nidentities of co-conspirators, it again ordered the Government to “disclose” all co-conspirator\nstatements, citing the Court’s earlier order.

Neither order expressly\ndirected the Government to produce a set of co-conspirator statements it would offer at trial\nseparately from the other evidence it would offer at trial.\n\nA requirement to “disclose statements” is not a requirement to isolate statements. For one,\nthe Court denied the defense request for effectively that relief in the first round of pretrial motions.\n(Op. & Order at 3o-3l, Dkt. No. 2o7). For another, in the defense’s many rounds of briefing on\nthis issue, it has cited no case—not from this District, nor any other—in which a Court ordered the\nGovernment to segregate and itemize co-conspirator statements from other statements for the\nconvenience of the defense. The Government is aware of no such case—likely because such an\norder would be in considerable tension with Circuit precedent, see In re U.S., 834 F.2d at 286. For\na third, the guiding principle of the defense’s justification for its request is to facilitate litigation\nof those statements’ admissibility <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>. But the law of the Second Circuit is that such\nstatements can be conditionally admited during the trial, and their admissibility litigated\nthereafter. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, 676 F.3d 26o, 273 n.8 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6, ll2o (2d Cir. l969)); Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7.

(See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” procedure was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court identification was so clear. See Wiggins, l32 F. App’x 86l, 864-66 (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(witness saw defendant at distance of 5o feet under “streetlight illumination” but was familiar with\ndefendant from seeing him previously in neighborhood); accord United States v.

GOVERNMENT CONCEDEDLY FAILED TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE\n\nBASIS OR REASONING TO ADMIT ANY 4o4(B) EVIDENCE\n\nThe government concedes that (i) it was aware of the December 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (Resp. at 34), (ll) those Amendments required it to give notice of the \"permited\npurpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the [4o4(b)] evidence and the reasoning that\nsupports the purpose\" (id.) (\"Notice\"), and (i) the October ll \"Maxwell Rule 4o4 Leter\"\n(\"Leter\") did not identify the \"permited purpose\" under Rule 4o4(b) for which the government\nseeks (alternative) admission of the two categories of evidence, nor the \"reasoning that supports\nthat evidence.\"! The government wholly fails to explain why it could not comply with these\n\"relatively modest\" new Notice requirements on the timeline ordered by this Court. Nouhere in\nresponse does the government seek leave for an extension to provide the appropriate Notice out\nof time nor justify its \"good cause\" for failure to timely comply with both the Court's Order and\nthe Rule. Instead, they assert that \"any alleged gap in the Government's notice is remediated by\nthis brief.\" Resp. at 39-4o. To quote the government's response to Ms. Maxwell's motion in\nlimine, \"to the extent the [government] takes issue with the rule\" requiring specific <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nNotice under Rule 4o4(b), \"that complaint is properly directed to the drafters of the Federal\nRules of Evidence.\" Resp. at 6l n.l5.\n\nHaving failed to comply with the Notice requirements of the Rule by the (extended)\nCourt ordered deadline of October ll, the government belatedly argues that the tendered\nevidence is either direct evidence or admissible under Rule 4o4(b).

Government Exhibit 52\n\nGovernment Exhibit (GX) 52 was acquired by the government as part of a sting operation\nfrom Alfredo Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriquez worked for Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six\nmonths, from late 2oo4 to early 2oo5. In 2oo9, he was deposed and then ultimately arrested in an\nundercover sting operation in which the government claims exhibit 52 was seized from Mr.\nRodriguez, apparently on or about November 3, 2oo9, by onc . who is not listed\nas a testifying witness. No one knous where or when the exhibit was acquired by Mr.\nRodriguez, what he did with it for as long as he had it, who may have created the exhibit, and\nwhere it came from. In its Response, the government does not identify what it claims this exhibit\nto be, who might authenticate the exhibit, only that a “witness with personal knouledge of the\nphysical book is expected to testify to its authenticity.” Resp. at 73. Given that Mr. Rodriguez is\ndead, and J is not a witness, we are left to wonder who this foundational witness may\nbe.\n\nThe government further claims that even if the exhibit is hearsay, it is admissible, not for\nthe truth of the mater asserted, but to shou “the defendant kept contact information for relevant\nindividuals at trial, including victims.” /d. These are bold, unexplained claims that Ms. Maxwell\ndisputes. The proffers here are inadequate to meet any burden of admissibility. The government\nshould not be alloued to refer to the exhibit prior to the establishment of an adequate foundation;\nand Ms. Maxwell requests a pretrial evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n\nC.

The\nCourt also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by the defendant, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the [foreign\ncitizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed monitorship, the defendant\n“would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll).

The Court\npromptly ordered the Government to confer with MDC counsel and provide the Court with an\nexplanation regarding the use of flashlights and the basis for it, which the Government then did.\n(Dkt. 257, 27o). On May l4, 2o2l, this Court issued an order denying the defendant’s request for\nan order directing the MDC to modify its nightime monitoring schedule. (Dkt. 282).

The Court Should Reject the Government’s Atempts to Preview any Defense\n\nCase or Cross Examination\n\nUnless and until the prosecution has established its prima facie case, the defendant “is not\ncalled upon to determine whether to produce documents and material normally privileged. It\nimposes a price on the exercise of a constitutional right to require a <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> decision of the trial\ntactics which are normally determined by a defense lawyer follouing the completion of the\nprima facie case.” United States v. Fratello, 44 F.R.D. 444, 452 (S.D.N.Y. l968). Moreover, the\ndecision to prosecute someone criminally carries with it certain consequences:\n\nUnder our constitutional system, a criminal defendant—need not do anything at all\n\nto defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.\n\nRather he has an absolute, unqualified right to compel the State to investigate its\n\noun case, find its oun witnesses, prove its oun facts, and convince the jury through\n\nits oun resources. Throughout the process the defendant has a fundamental right to\n\nremain silent, in effect challenging the State at every point to: “Prove it!”\n\nUnited States v. Wilkerson, 388 F. Supp. 3d 969, 972 (E.D. Tenn. 2ol9) (quoting Williams v.\nFlorida, 399 U.S. 78, ll2 (l97o) (Black, J., dissenting)).\n\nMuch of the government’s argument is directed at causing the defense to provide a\npreview of its strategy and the substance of defense cross examination which should be rejected\nby the Court.\n\nI. THE GOVERNMENT’S PSEUDONYM TACTIC IS UNNECESSARY,\n\nUNWORKABLE, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THIS CASE\n\nThe government proposes various false or partial names for some of the accusers and\nwitnesses.

None of the witnesses are\nrr’.\nOO —CSCSCSCiesA\nOO e—CSCSC‘CNSCies\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006448.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of 69\nI. SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone associated with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. <span class=\"highlight\">PRE-TRIAL</span> RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way. Mot. at l7. Under the government's\napparent view, any credibility challenge will permit any prior statement of the government's\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)). The effect of the 2ol4 Amendment then, as\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 69\nthe Second Court explained, was to allou for such statements to be admited \"substantively as\nwell,\" rather than as non-substantive rehabilitation. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (amendment \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain applicable post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s amendment in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement. In Zome, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo645o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5l of 69\n6l2-l3; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42. Accordingly, this evidence does not impermissibly question\nthe government’s motives and should not be precluded.\n\nV. A <span class=\"highlight\">PRE-TRIAL</span> BAN ON CHALLENGES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF NON-\n\nTESTIFYING WITNESSES IS UNSUPPORTED LEGALLY OR FACTUALLY\n\nThe government again refrains from telling the Court exactly what evidence it expects at\ntrial, yet asks the defense to preview its possible cross-examination or defense-case evidence, in\norder both to circumvent the Rules of Criminal Procedure's guidelines and this Court's orders as\nto when the defense must disclose certain evidence. What's more, the government gives only\nsummary suggestions of what the evidence \"might\" be and then asks the Court to rule\ndefinitively that the defense is precluded from challenging that evidence via cross-examination\nor otherwise. Because this Court cannot rule on the admissibility of impeachment evidence of a\nnon-testifying witness unless and until the government actually elicits testimony concerning such\na witness, this motion should be denied or deferred until the appropriate time at trial.\n\nThe government does a poor job of previewing exactly what statements it anticipates\noffering from others related i\n\nP| It says that \"other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities” of\nthose two non-testifying witnesses, \"including [unspecified] statements by them,\" which\nstatements according to the government \"will not include any statements ... offered for the truth\nof the mater asserted or under one of the other exceptions listed under Rule 8o6.\" Mot. at 37-38.\nThe government then gives two non-exclusive examples”? but fails to elucidate what exactly the\npertinent statements will be, to wit:\n© The government does not give any examples pertaining to PR\ntherefore it is wholly unclear what statements the government intends to elicit about her or for what\npurpose.

The ill-founded\nmotion should be denied.\n\nA. The Government Cites No Authority for Requiring <span class=\"highlight\">Pre-trial</span> Notice of Such\n\nEvidence.\n\nAt the outset, this Court can deny the government’s motion for a simple reason: There is\nno authority requiring Ms. Maxwell to provide the government with notice of the evidence she\nintends to offer at trial. To the contrary, when such notice is required, the Rules of Evidence or\nProcedure make the requirement express. Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b), for example,\nimposes a duty on Ms. Maxwell to make certain disclosures, particularly as they regard expert\nwitnesses and opinions. But the Rule does not require her to identify evidence of her “absence\nwhen Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s case-in-chief” and then\n“explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.”\n\nNor does Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) require notice from the defendant. In fact, the\ngovernment’s invocation of Rule 4o4(b) actually undermines its motion. In a criminal case, that\nRule imposes on the government a duty to provide advance notice of any other-acts evidence it\ndesires to admit at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).°? The Rule does not impose a similar obligation\non a defendant.\n\n° The Rule says:\n\nIn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so\n\nthat the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the\n\nevidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause, excuses\n\nlack of pretrial notice.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3) (emphasis added).\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\nrelevance of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., charitable\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any\nsuch evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page6ofl2\nrejected by the Court which ordered disclosure at the same time as the government's witness list,\nRule 4o4(b) notice, exhibits, and 35oo materials no later than October ll, 2o2l, so that the\nDefense would not be surprised at trial and because of “the need for the parties to litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial....”” Dkt. 335 at 3.\n\nThe government seized multiple electronic devices, including computers and servers\nfrom alleged co-conspirator Epstein. These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6562\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5ofl2\n\nAfter December 2o2o, according to the Advisory Commitee, the new subsection (B)\nrequires that:\n\nThe prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer\n\npursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the\n\nevidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in\n\nlight of this purpose.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\nanticipated evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc.

Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3.

The Court further ordered the Government to “disclose all co-\nconspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this\nCourt’s scheduling order.” (/d. at 2).\n\nAccordingly, on October ll, 2o2l, the Government produced its exhibit list and Jencks\nAct material to the defendant. The Jencks Act materials and exhibits contained the only co-\nconspirator statements in the Government’s possession that will be offered at trial. It also disclosed\nthe identities of the individuals to whom it may refer at trial as co-conspirators and informed the\ndefendant that it “has produced all co-conspirator statements which it intends to offer at trial ...\nin the Government’s production [that day] or in its previous productions.” (Def.

As of October ll, the\nGovernment produced all co-conspirator statements in its possession that it intends to offer at trial.\nTo the extent that the Government learns of additional co-conspirator statements as it prepares for\ntrial—such as in a session preparing a witness for trial—it will produce those statements as part of\nits ongoing Jencks Act obligations.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6o of 84\n\nThe defense errs when it suggests that the Court ordered the Government to specifically\nitemize any co-conspirator statements contained in its disclosures. When the Court first set a\ndisclosure schedule for Jencks Act material, it adopted the “Government’s proposal,” which\nopposed any requirement that the Government isolate co-conspirator statements from other witness\nstatements. (Order at l, Dkt. No. 297). When the Court ordered the Government to produce the\nidentities of co-conspirators, it again ordered the Government to “disclose” all co-conspirator\nstatements, citing the Court’s earlier order. (Order at 2, Dkt. No. 335). Neither order expressly\ndirected the Government to produce a set of co-conspirator statements it would offer at trial\nseparately from the other evidence it would offer at trial.\n\nA requirement to “disclose statements” is not a requirement to isolate statements. For one,\nthe Court denied the defense request for effectively that relief in the first round of pretrial motions.\n(Op. & Order at 3o-3l, Dkt. No. 2o7). For another, in the defense’s many rounds of briefing on\nthis issue, it has cited no case—not from this District, nor any other—in which a Court ordered the\nGovernment to segregate and itemize co-conspirator statements from other statements for the\nconvenience of the defense. The Government is aware of no such case—likely because such an\norder would be in considerable tension with Circuit precedent, see In re U.S., 834 F.2d at 286. For\na third, the guiding principle of the defense’s justification for its request is to facilitate litigation\nof those statements’ admissibility <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>. But the law of the Second Circuit is that such\nstatements can be conditionally admited during the trial, and their admissibility litigated\nthereafter. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, 676 F.3d 26o, 273 n.8 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6, ll2o (2d Cir. l969)); Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7.

(See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument.

The government wholly fails to explain why it could not comply with these\n\"relatively modest\" new Notice requirements on the timeline ordered by this Court. Nouhere in\nresponse does the government seek leave for an extension to provide the appropriate Notice out\nof time nor justify its \"good cause\" for failure to timely comply with both the Court's Order and\nthe Rule. Instead, they assert that \"any alleged gap in the Government's notice is remediated by\nthis brief.\" Resp. at 39-4o.

Mr. Rodriquez worked for Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six\nmonths, from late 2oo4 to early 2oo5. In 2oo9, he was deposed and then ultimately arrested in an\nundercover sting operation in which the government claims exhibit 52 was seized from Mr.\nRodriguez, apparently on or about November 3, 2oo9, by onc . who is not listed\nas a testifying witness. No one knous where or when the exhibit was acquired by Mr.\nRodriguez, what he did with it for as long as he had it, who may have created the exhibit, and\nwhere it came from. In its Response, the government does not identify what it claims this exhibit\nto be, who might authenticate the exhibit, only that a “witness with personal knouledge of the\nphysical book is expected to testify to its authenticity.” Resp. at 73. Given that Mr. Rodriguez is\ndead, and J is not a witness, we are left to wonder who this foundational witness may\nbe.\n\nThe government further claims that even if the exhibit is hearsay, it is admissible, not for\nthe truth of the mater asserted, but to shou “the defendant kept contact information for relevant\nindividuals at trial, including victims.” /d. These are bold, unexplained claims that Ms. Maxwell\ndisputes. The proffers here are inadequate to meet any burden of admissibility. The government\nshould not be alloued to refer to the exhibit prior to the establishment of an adequate foundation;\nand Ms. Maxwell requests a pretrial evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n\nC.

If the Defense\nanticipated calling a witness who refuses to testify, the Defense would have the same tools at its\ndisposal as does the Government to compel that witness’s atendance at trial. The Defense could\nhave, for example, subpoenaed a witness under Rule l7. If the witness resides abroad, the\nDefense could have sought a leter rogatory under 28 U.S.C. § l78l, which is a mechanism that\nthe Second Circuit has repeatedly emphasized. See, e.g., United States v. Brennerman, 8l8 F.\nApp’x 25, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2o) (citing § l78l as a mechanism for a criminal defendant to “secure\ntestimony from the United Kingdom’’); United States v. Lee, 723 F.3d l34, l42 n.6 (2d Cir.\n2ol3). These mechanisms ensure that pseudonyms are not necessary to secure a reluctant\nwitness’s testimony and the Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting pseudonyms.\n\nThird, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for a witness that works as a plain\nclothes law enforcement officer, citing in support a large body of case law in which anonymity\nwas granted for testifying law enforcement officers. Def. Leter at 5. But as the Government\nnotes, the cases relied on by the Defense uniformly involve officers that work undercover such\nthat revealing their true name to the public would subject them to violent retaliation by the\ndefendant or other individuals, or would frustrate their ability to remain undercover. E.g., United\nStates v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8); United States v. Hernandez, No. Sl\nl2 CR 8o9 PKC, 2ol3 WL 3936l85 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2ol3). Even further afield, the Defense\ncites in support a case in which a covert CIA officer testified under a pseudonym. United States\nv. Schulte, 436 F. Supp. 3d 698 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o). These cases are inapplicable to the present\nrequest as proffered to the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document59o _ Filed o2/ol/22 Page5of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See Silver, 2ol6\nWL l572993, at *5 (citing United States v. Doe, 63 F.3d l2l, l28 (2d Cir. l995) (“Compelling\ninterests may include the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”)). Sealing is warranted to protect a\ndefendant's fair trial rights if the Court makes specific findings that “first, there is a substantial\nprobability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that [sealing]\nwould prevent, and, second, reasonable alternatives to [sealing] cannot adequately protect the\ndefendant’s fair trial rights. /d. at *8 (quoting Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court of California for\nRiverside Cty., 478 U.S. l, l4 (l986) (citations omited) (“Press-Enterprise IT’)).\n\nAlthough cases addressing this point have focused on the need to seal to prevent the\nprejudicial effects of pretrial publicity on a defendant’s right to a fair trial, rather than the effects\nof post-trial disclosure on a defendant’s motion for a new trial, the principle at stake is the same.\nMs. Maxwell vigorously asserts that she did not receive a fair trial because of Juror 5o’s presence\non the jury (and potentially the presence of other jurors who were the victims of sexual abuse).\nThrough her Motion, Ms. Maxwell is seeking to vindicate her right to a fair trial and to remedy the\nstructural error that occurred during the voir dire process. Ms. Maxwell’s fair trial rights must be\nprotected post-trial just as vigorously as they are <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>. To do that, it is necessary to keep the\nMotion temporarily sealed.\n\n2o873o6.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008895.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 594 _ Filed o2/o4/22 Page3of5\nPage 3\n\nThere is no need to litigate the Defense Motion under seal just because the Court and the\nparties are contemplating a hearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. Throughout the course of\nthis case (as in most if not every case), the parties have publicly litigated evidentiary issues\nimplicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their counsel could access the briefing if they\nso wished. In this case, the parties publicly filed significant <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> briefing, including <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nmotions and motions in /imine, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in\nmotions in limine, the parties litigated the legal contours of the testimony of the witness who\ntestified under the pseudonym Kate, as well as the circumstances of Carolyn’s identification of the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 387, 392, 397. Neither the Government nor the defendant sought\nto file such documents under seal; the defendant certainly did not claim that such documents should\nbe temporarily sealed because Government witnesses could access such filings (or news articles\nabout such filings) and accordingly tailor their trial testimony. There is no reason that the Defense\nMotion should be treated differently and litigated entirely under seal.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the public docketing of the Defense Motion will enable\nJuror 5o to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only inconsistent with the foregoing practice\nin this (like every) case, but it is also unsupported by any legal authority. (Def. Leter at 2). The\ndefendant’s reliance on cases involving <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> publicity is inapposite. Those cases concern the\nright to a fair ‘rial, and, in those cases, sealing is proper upon specific findings that, inter alia,\n“there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by\npublicity ....” United States v. Silver, No. l5 Cr. 93 (VEC), 2ol6 WL l572993, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. l4, 2ol6) (quotations and citations omited). But in such a posture, the potential prejudice is\nthat the jury—the relevant finder of fact—will learn prejudicial information that they otherwise\nwould not. /d. Here, by significant contrast, the Court is the relevant finder of fact, and the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8895\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594_ Filed o2/o4/22 Page4of5\nPage 4\nobviously will be reading the Defense Motion prior to any hearing. The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\n<span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court).

(Def. Mot. at 23-24). As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, the use of grooming\ntechniques is common among perpetrators of child sexual abuse. (See Tr. 7l3). But using a\ncommon tool among sexual offenders does not render the distinct conspiracies here multiplicitous;\nif that were true, presumably many federal crimes against children would be multiplicitous.\n\nThe Government was clear at trial that, while the defendant and Epstein commited crimes\ntogether for years, they did so through different schemes, in violation of different laws.

The Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Her Conviction and Dismiss the Indictment\nBased on Alleged Improper <span class=\"highlight\">Pre-Trial</span> Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should vacate her conviction and dismiss the\nIndictment because the Government’s allegedly excessive delay in bringing the charges violates\nher due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 25). The defendant’s contention should be swiftly rejected.\nThe Court has twice evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and twice\nconcluded that the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a\nclaim that any alleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7;\nDkt. No. 3l7 at lo). Her arguments fare no beter post-trial.\n\nThe defendant has not and cannot successfully establish a violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment.

Hoo, 825 F.2d 667, 67l (2d Cir. l987))). Indeed, some version of the phrase “deliberate\ndevice” and “tactical advantage” is found in nearly every Second Circuit decision on the issue.\nSee, e.g., Alameh, 34l F.3d at l76 (“intentionally used delay to gain unfair tactical advantage”);\nCornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (requiring “intentional device” to gain “tactical advantage”); Lawson,\n683 F.2d at 694 (delay not “engineered by the government for an improper purpose, such as gaining\na tactical advantage”); Snyder, 668 F.2d at 689; United States v.

Hillegas, 578 F.2d 453, 46o (2d Cir. l978).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nBecause the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the\ndefendant’s specious arguments that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment\ndelay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o, at *5. In any event, in denying the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions and supplemental pre-\ntrial motions, the Court noted the absence of “evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing\nthese charges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Dkt. No. 2o7 at\nl7; Dkt. No. 3l7 at lo). That remains true.\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR- oooo96o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 47 of5l\n\nAs the Government explained in its memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s twelve\n<span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions, dated February 26, 2o2l (Dkt. No. 2o4 at 4l-59), and in its memorandum in\nopposition to the defendant’s supplemental motions, dated May 2l, 2o2l (Dkt. No. 295 at l3-l6),\nthe Indictments in this case were brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s collection of\nevidence to support the charges. Any suggestion that the Government intentionally delayed\nobtaining the Indictments to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in fact, and for good\nreason: itis not true. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay,\nmuch less an intentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nIn her current motion, the defendant offers no additional argument or factual claims\nwhatsoever in support of her argument that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-\nindictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. Indeed, she\nignores the second prong of the pre-indictment delay standard and refers the Court back to her\nprior briefing, which this Court has twice considered and rejected. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7; Dkt. No.\n3l7 at lo). If anything, the trial record undermined the defendant’s argument on this prong. In an\neffort to shou the victims’ supposed financial motivations for testifying, the defendant repeatedly\nfocused the jury’s atention on the fact that victims only recently agreed to cooperate with the\nGovernment. That same evidence precludes any argument of intentional delay by the Government.\nThe defendant’s renewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon\npre-indictment delay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643-l Filed o3/ll/22 Page4of6\n“None of that relates to traumatic memory,” he said.

This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o.

As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror SO is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “‘believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt.

In the :\nevent the Court determines it would benefit from Maxwell’s commentary as to a discrete aspect\nof these transcripts, the Court stands ready to make that excerpt, or a synopsis thereof, available\nto her counsel to facilitate counsel’s briefing, But there is no justification for Maxwell to obtain\nthe extraordinary relief of plenary access to the grand jury transcripts in her case.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release\non bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court\nDENIES the Defendant’s motion.\nIn light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that\nshould not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose\nany redactions to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by reference to\nthe Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir.\n2oo6). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted,\nthe Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.\nThis Order provides the botom line of the Court’s resolution. On July l4, 2o2o, this\nCourt conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> detention was warranted\nbecause the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance at future proceedings. Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if\nthe Court finds “that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool97l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019714.jpg": "Case L2G d4lo633o-ccImeDozuie h? LOL l Filed TR8282o9ePagfe2 of 2\nnone of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a\nmaterial bearing on the Court’s determination that she poses a flight risk.\n\nFurthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention\nwas warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release\ncan reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings. In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> detention continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

The Constitution’s “prohibitions on the deprivation of liberty\nwithout due process and of excessive bail require careful review of\npretrial detention orders to ensure that the statutory mandate [of the\nBail Reform Act] has been respected.” United States v. Motamedi, 767\nF.2d l4o38, l4o5 (9th Cir. l985) (Kennedy, J.). Because the consequence\nof error — the unjust deprivation of liberty from an individual who is\npresumed innocent — is contrary to our Constitution, “doubts regarding\nthe propriety of release should be resolved in favor of the defendant.” Id.\n\nEven where the government is able to prove that an accused is an\nactual flight risk, pretrial detention generally remains inappropriate.\nUnited States v. Berrios-Berrios, 79l F.2d 246, 25l (2d Cir. l986) (“the\npresumption in favor of bail sti// applies where the defendant is found to\nbe a risk of flight”) (emphasis added). Where the only question is\nwhether the defendant is a risk of flight, “the law still favors <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nrelease subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination\nof conditions, that the court determines will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oool9856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019888.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDISSCUAUN Distant &Pitdd BPFH Pager S2o\n\nThe government bears a dual burden in seeking <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> detention. First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020180.jpg": "CaSast: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePageBlGhl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">Pre-Trial</span> Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020185.jpg": "CaSede2Zo ep Qo33ouAUNIt BibCu trent l7o2 lFiteb 83228 /2 49g PaGeoly Ob l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nMarch l4\" 2o2l\n\nRe: Additional opinion on the extradition of nationals by the French government\n\nl.

Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020235.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page of 25\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n|}\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n: Dkt.

(Ex. I). After considering multiple writen\nsubmissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another writen\nopinion. (Ex. L).\n\n24. Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that detention was warranted\nin light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

(/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll).

No\nadditional delay is necessary or in the interests of justice. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer and by May lo, 2o2l, they shall jointly propose a trial\nstart date for the Court to request of the Clerk's Office (as is required by COVID\nprotocols).

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> disclosures accordingly.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Government has moved for an order requiring\nDavid Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l follouing an op-ed that he\nauthored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 3o9. Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that \"presumptively involve a substantial\nlikelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.\" S.D.N.Y.\nLocal Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated\nwith the pending case are nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the\npurview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to\nMr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and\ncounsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair\ntrial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters\nheading touard trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those\nassociated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they\nrisk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of\nthe upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h). In addition to the\nimpact it could have on this mater, failure to comply could also result in atorney\ndiscipline. Id. Rule 23.l(4).

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

In this opinion, the Court addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennet\nGershman based on the parties' current proffers....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion\n& Order ***]... TI. Conclusion. The Court therefore grants the Government's motion\nto preclude Gershman's expert testimony. Because this is a preliminary <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at trial would alter the Court's\nanalysis.

Br., Ex. l (\"Notice\"). Two of\nthose experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer opinions\nthat rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The\nGovernment on November 8, 2o2l, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony\nof Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that\nmotion. On November l5, 2o2l, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude\nthe testimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November\nl9, 2o2l. The Court addresses the motion to preclude Dr. Hall in this separate opinion.\nIt will address the other five experts in public rulings....[*** See this Memorandum\nOpinion & Order ***]... III. Conclusion. The Court therefore grants the Government's\nmotion to preclude Dr. Hall's expert testimony. Because this is a preliminary <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at trial would alter the Court's\nanalysis. In that event, the Defense must re—raise its request to admit Dr. Hall as an\nexpert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

ENDORSEMENT: The\nCourt grants in part the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is\nguided by the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put\nforward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties\nand alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions. See United States v.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o526\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020527.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page4l of 92\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995).

Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office as\nthe trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent\nwith the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury.\nHouever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur\nduring the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the\nGovernment's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> schedule. So that the\nCourt can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial\ncommencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in\nadvance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29.

No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

Nevertheless, the Court urges\nthe MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be reduced.

ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants in\npart the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

Id. at ll92o.\nIn balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds\nthat the arguments the Government has put forward in this leter, including the need to\nprotect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly\ntailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995).\nSimilarly, the Court concludes that the Government has shoun that Exhibits E, F, G, H,\nand I should be filed under seal.

The Government has moved for an order requiring\nDavid Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l follouing an op-ed that he\nauthored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 3o9. Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and the Court declines to\nconsider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect to\nwhether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule provides\nillustrative examples of statements that \"presumptively involve a substantial likelihood\nthat their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the\ndue administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.\" S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal\nRule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated with the pending case\nare nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the purview of Local Criminal\nRule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to Mr. Markus. This Court has\npreviously noted that counsel[,] agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nmust take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No.\n28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters heading touard trial are especially\nsensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those associated with this case must act to ensure\nthe case is tried solely in court or else they risk being deemed responsible for any trial\ndelay or for undermining the integrity of the upcoming trial. See $.D.N.Y. Local Criminal\nRule 23.l(h). In addition to the impact it could have on this mater, failure to comply\ncould also result in atorney discipline. Id. Rule 23.l(i).

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worn\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v.

Loftus said herself\nthat she had never conducted a study on whether these tactics would\nwork with memories of sexual abuse, David recalled.\nSince the trial, there has been speculation that the fact a juror had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse could be used by Maxwell as grounds for appeal.\nSpeaking separately to MailOnline, David said he could not remember the\ndetails of the 5o question <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> questionnaire each potential juror was\nasked about whether they were a victim of sexual abuse or a relative ora\nfriend of a victim, but felt he had answered all questions honestly.\nDavid told The Independent that the accusers’ testimony was\ncorroborated by a significant amount of evidence.\nHe specifically mentioned Kate — an accuser who testified but was not\nalloued to be considered for the actual charges because she was over the\nage of consent in the UK when she was abused — and said her testimony\npouerfully corroborated the other accusers’ stories.\n“She was able to shou us that this was a patern.” David said. “We knew\nwe couldn't use her testimony to convict Maxwell, but she shoued the\npatern of hou those girls were groomed.\n“She shoued us the patern that happened to all of these girls.\n“It was about confusing their boundaries.” he said. “For Jane, it started\nwith seeing Maxwell topless. For Annie Farmer, it started with Maxwell\nshouing her hou to give Epstein a foot massage.\n“The patern is that Ghislaine talks to you like she is also a teenager. Then\nit moves into massage. She tries to make you comfortable, to see what\nthey can get away with.\n“What she did was wrong.”\nAnnie Farmer's story was backed up by her teenage diary, as well as her\nhigh school bovfriend. That was important to the jury, he said.\nCarolyn’s story was backed up by Shawn, her ex-boyfriend who testified\nthat he used to drive her to Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o87l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020978.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel52 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garmered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span>. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror 5o is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt.

Scopo, 86l F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. l988) (internal quotations omited).\nWhile there “is no mechanical test with respect to requests for a continuance or adjournment,”\nUnited States v. Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential <span class=\"highlight\">pre-trial</span> motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022111.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 42 Filed o9/l4/2o Pagelofl\nThe Law Offices of\nMONTELL FIGGINS,.c\nl7 Academy Street, Suite 3o5\nNewark, New Jersey o7lo2\nPhone: (973) 242-47oo\nFax: (973) 242-47ol\nwww.figginslaw.com BRANCH\npu a\nl4o East Ridgewood Avenue 3o Wall Street 8\" Floor\nParamus, NJ o764o | | New York, NY loo5\nReply to Newark Office [X]\nOf Counsel\nDouglas Mitchell, Esq.\nLinda Childs, Esq.\nSeptember l4, 2o2o\nSENT VIA ECF\nHonorable Analisa Torres\nU.S. Southern District of NY\n5oo Pearl Street\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: USA v Michael Thomas, et al.\nDocket No.: l:l9-cr-oo83o\nRequest for Emergency Out of State Travel\nYour Honor,\n\nThis firm represents Defendant, Michael Thomas, in the above-captioned mater.
