Any reasonable, intelligent, jury cannot be instructed to ignore the follouing:\n\ne = Ms. Maxwell was sued for defamation by an alleged victim because she called the\nalleged victim a liar.\n\ne The government necessarily believes that Ms. Maxwell, not the alleged victims in\nthis case, is a liar, which is why the government charged her with perjury.\n\ne By implication, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers here, arguing that she is innocent, should not\nbe believed because they were complicit in the perjury.\n\ne In considering whether the jury should convict Ms. Maxwell of enticing girls to\ntravel to perform illegal sex acts the jury should ignore all of the underlying facts\nrelated to the defamation action including, for example, the 3o alleged victims,\nEpstein’s setlement, the CVRA litigation, Epstein’s, and Ms. Maxwell’s non-\nprosecution agreement.\n\nIn addition, the government glosses over, via a footnote, enormous prejudice atendant to\nthe perjury charges: Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice for five years also represented her in the\ndefamation action. The deposition transcript and the perjury charges place the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell’s lawyers at issue. The government obfuscates hou it intends to establish materiality of\nthe statements, but it is probable that the government will atempt to do so through the testimony\nof the civil lawyers who prosecuted the defamation action. Any rational jury would want, as a\ncounter, testimony from the defending lawyers on the same topic. The government suggests that\nthis is no problem, at least for the prosecutors, under NY RPC 3.7.
