This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997).

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately <span class=\"highlight\">activated</span> a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse. A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR\non Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant. At approximately 6:39 a.m., Epstein was placed on a stretcher and\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023437.jpg": "because he did not conduct any rounds within the SHU on August 9 and he did not recall signing the form.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant confirmed that she conducted her round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said she went up to the\nlo South Unit and then back doun to the SHU because she needed to sign the round sheets. Contrary to\nBOP training for new Lieutenants, which she atended in 2oll, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\ntold the OIG, “We are not required to go to each individual cell and look at the inmates. When we make\nrounds, we get with the officers.” The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said she did not conduct a\nround to observe the inmates when she visited the SHU. Noel confirmed that the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant visited the SHU but did not walk doun the tiers.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the\nOIG determined that at approximately 4 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nbriefly visited the SHU as part of her supervisory duties and conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were\nseated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU. Noel told the OIG that at\napproximately 5:3o a.m., Thomas went to the lo South Unit, which was adjacent to the SHU, to relieve CO 3,\nand that CO 3 briefly walked through the SHU common area as he left and returned from his break. The\nOIG's review and analysis of the video footage revealed that, aside from those two officers, no one entered\nthe SHU and no one conducted any counts or rounds.\nVI. Epstein’s Death on August lo\nA. Discovery of Epstein Hanged in Cell and Emergency Response\nOn August lo, 2ol9, shortly after 6 a.m., the doorbell to the SHU rang, indicating that a delivery of breakfast\ncarts had arrived at the SHU. Noel and Thomas retrieved the breakfast carts from the double-locked\nentrance to the SHU and brought them inside the SHU. At the time, Thomas and Noel were the only officers\nin the SHU. At approximately 6:3o a.m., MCC New York security camera video recordings shou Noel and\nThomas walking touard the L Tier. Noel and Thomas told the OIG that at this time they were entering the\nL Tier, in which Epstein was housed, to deliver breakfast to the inmates. As discussed previously, between\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, the OIG did not observe\non the available recorded video any COs or other individuals approach the L Tier where Epstein was housed\nfrom the common area of the SHU.\nNoel told the OIG that she unlocked the door to the L Tier so Thomas could deliver the breakfast trays.\nThomas told the OIG that he knocked on Epstein’s cell door, saw a portion of Epstein through the windou\nbut could not make out what he saw, so he said to Epstein, “Come to the door, come to the door.” Thomas\nsaid he did not observe any movement or hear a response, so he unlocked the cell door, entered the cell,\nand saw Epstein hanged as described further belou. Thomas said he immediately yelled for Noel to get\nhelp, and that Noel <span class=\"highlight\">activated</span> a body alarm, signaling a medical emergency, and began taking the steps\ndescribed belou.\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023452.tif": "Only two cameras in the vicinity of the SHU area were recording to DVR l at the time of Epstein’s death.”\nOne camera was located on the upper-level entrance to the lo South Unit, a housing unit adjacent to the\nSHU, near the door MCC New York staff referred to as the “46 door.” That camera captured video of a large\npart of the common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways\nleading to the different SHU tiers, including the tier containing Epstein’s cell. Thus, anyone entering or\natempting to enter the L Tier from the common area of the SHU on August 9 and lo would have been\npicked up by the video recorded by that camera. Epstein’s cell door, houever, was not in that camera’s field\nof view. The other camera that was recording was located in one of the ninth floor’s two elevator bays and\nprovided video of the ninth-floor fire exit and two of the floor’s four elevators.\nThe available video shoued that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted touard the\nL Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge. At approximately\nlo:39 p.m., an unidentified CO appeared to walk up the L Tier stairway, and then reappeared within view of\nthe camera at lo:4l p.m. This is believed to be the last time anyone entered L Tier before approximately\n6:3o a.m. on August lo. Between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and just before 6:3o a.m. on\nAugust lo, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video any CO or other individual enter any of the SHU\ntiers, which is consistent with CO Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas's admissions to the OIG\nthat the SHU rounds and counts were not conducted during that time frame. At approximately 6:28 a.m., an\nunidentified officer was observed on the L Tier stairway, presumably to deliver breakfast food trays.\nBetween 6:28 a.m. and 6:32 a.m., an unidentified officer, believed to be Noel, moved back and forth several\ntimes between the L Tier stairway and the SHU Officers’ Station. At approximately 6:33 a.m., additional\nofficers entered the SHU and ascended the L Tier stairway, presumably after Noel <span class=\"highlight\">activated</span> her body alarm\nwhen Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell.\nAs noted above, the camera at the end of the L Tier was providing a live video feed at the time of Epstein’s\ndeath but the video was not being recorded. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that certain MCC\nNew York personnel, including the Control Center, SIS personnel, the Warden, most Lieutenants, and the\nElectronics Technician, had access to the live video feed of the institution’s security cameras. He explained\nthat to view the live feed of a particular camera an employee with access would need to key in the specific\ncamera into the security camera system to call up the live feed. The Correctional Systems Officer, who was\nworking in the Control Center on August lo from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant both told the OIG that the only live feed from the SHU on their screens was video from the\ncamera shouing the SHU common area, and they did not perceive a need to take the necessary steps to see\nthe live feed from the SHU L Tier from either of their duty stations on the evening Epstein died.\n53 One additional camera located at the lo South Officers’ Station was recording on August lo, 2ol9. That camera is not\ndepicted in Figure 4.l2 because neither the SHU nor the SHU entrances were within the field of view of that camera.\n“4 The OIG found the video captured by the camera at the entrance to the lo South Unit to be of lou quality. Due to the\nvideo's lou quality and the distance between the camera and the SHU common area, the OIG was able to observe\nmovement of individuals within the SHU but was not always able to conclusively identify the individuals. The OIG was\nalso not always able to determine the specific destinations of the individuals seen in the video given that the camera\nonly captured partial views of the stairways to the various SHU tiers. The OIG found that movements captured on the\nvideo were generally consistent with employee actions described by multiple witnesses and certain actions documented\nin BOP records.\n\n85\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023609.jpg": "Re: Jeffrey Epstein, 763l8-o54\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nDate 2ol9/o8/o7 l3:ll\n\nSubject: Re: Jeffrey Epstein, 763l8-o54\n\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nal\n| will notify Unit Team of the belou. | understand he has had two calls so far, but am not sure his phone\naccount was fully <span class=\"highlight\">activated</span> yet.\nThank you,\n\n> > PO @gmail.com> 8/5/2ol9 8:46 AM >>>\nMr. PO ene)\n| understand that Mr. Epstein has not yet had the opportunity to establish a telephone\naccount.

These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.
