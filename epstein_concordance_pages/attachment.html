If visiting\nindependently, representatives must follou the requirements set\nforth in the “Legal Representatives” section belou. See Section\n8.\nAtorneys are ordinarily not permited to bring material\nwitnesses into the Visiting Room. Prior approval to do soa must\nbe received from the Warden and requires a court order. Writen\nrequests for such approval should clearly outline the specific\nclrcumstances requiring this type of visit. Visits will not be\napproved if alternative arrangements are avallable to defense\ncounsel.\n7. Dress Code\nAll visitors, including atorneys, are required to dress ina\nmanner appropriate for a correctional environment. Excessively\nprovocative, immodest or revealing atire is reason to deny\nvisiting. Visitors over the age of l2 will not be alioued into\nthe institution in short skirts, mini skirts, shorts or dresses\nexceeding three inches above the kneecap in length. See-through\nclothing, halter-tops, tube tops, tank tops, any top that\nreveals the midriff area, lou-cut shirts or blouses, revealing\nfront and/or backless clothing, skin-tight clothing, spandex\nclothing and sweat pants are not alloued. Furthermore, clothing\nwhich may impede identification {e.g., hoods) or easily hide\ncontraband (e.9., coats) present security concerns and are also\nprohibited. All visitors are required to wear shoes (no shouer\nshoes, flip-fiops, toe-revealing or backless shoes of any kind)\nand undergarments (including bras for females). The Warden has\ndelegated to the Institution Duty Officer the ultimate decision—\nmaking authority regarding what atire is appropriate inside the\nVisating Room. If the Buty Officer is not available, the\nOperations Lieutenant will make the final decision. A\nmemorandum containing clothing guidelines is posted in the lobby\nof MCC New York. It is the responsibility of visitors to\nfamiliarize themselves with this memo and watch for updates.\n8. Legal Representatives\nAtorneys are alloued to visit their clients upon providing\nevidence of their professional status. Houever, atorneys often\nneed other individuals, e.g., paralegals, interpreters,\nmitigation specialists, private investigators, to visit their\nclients in connection with legal representation. These\nindividuals do not receive the same entry privileges granted to\natorneys and must first submit an application (See <span class=\"highlight\">ATTACHMENT</span>\nA) signed by a sponsoring atorney and pass a background check\nbefore being granted permission to enter MCC New York.\nPage 7 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2375o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023751.tif": "Once approved, the individual will be included on a list\nmaintained in the lobby and alloued to enter the institution for\none year with appropriate government issued IB. The entry\napplication may be requested from and mailed to the Legal\nDepartments of either MCC New York or MDC Brooklyn. Once\napproved the individual may enter both institutions.\nFor mitigation specialists, every time they visit the\ninstitution For a new inmate, they must submit a court order to\nthe Legal Department which authorizes them to enter the\ninstitution to visit with that specific inmate. Upon reapplying\nat the end of their one year entry period, mitigation\nspecialists and doctors are required to produce a new order,\nreflecting the new year.\n9. Polygraphs\nThe Warden may permit polygraph tests in connection with state or\nfederal criminal felony investigations. See 28 C.F.R. $55l.7l.\nPolygraph tests in connection with misdemeanor offenses, civil\nproceedings, or any other maters are generally disapproved,\nabsent a federal court order. See Id.
