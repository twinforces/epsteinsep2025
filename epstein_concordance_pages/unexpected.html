Accordingly, the Rule requires the defense to provide\n(l) “notice of the expert’s qualifications which in turn will permit the requesting party to\ndetermine whether in fact the witness is an expert within the definition of Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2;” (2) a “summary of the expected testimony,” which “permit[s] more complete\npretrial preparation by the requesting party;” and (3) “a summary of the bases of the expert’s\nopinion.” Jd.\n\nThe content of the expert notice must actually “summarize the experts’ opinions.”\nUnited States v.

A young person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in\nby Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try to piece together a life in the aftermath\nof this trauma that left them feeling distrustful and fearful. Most of these individuals had families\nwho were also negatively impacted as they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved\none’s losses and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure.\n\nMaxwell had many opportunities to come clean, but instead continued to make choices that\ncaused more harm. When my sister and I first spoke out to the media about what happened to us,\nMaxwell lied about us and threatened Maria, thus helping shut doun investigations into Epstein’s\nbehavior so they could together continue to harm children and young women. After this atempt\nto alert people to Epstein and Maxwell’s abusive behavior, I avoided being public about it for\nalmost two decades. My shame told me that I should hide this fact because it was embarrassing.\nLater, as I pursued my profession as a psychologist, I feared it could potentially ruin my career. I\nworried clients would not want to work with me if I was associated with this story wrongly labeled\nas one of “child prostitution.” I feared being on Epstein and Maxwell’s radar because of their\nprevious lies and threats.\n\n2 of 3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo6o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document674 _ Filed o6/24/22 Page3of 29\nBSF\n\nthemselves.

In addition to the way I was impacted as an individual, there was the pain I experienced\nas a sister due to hou Maria was abused by Maxwell and Epstein, and the harm caused to the rest\nof my family due to these events. My sister’s abuse—the sexual assault, Maxwell’s threats that\nstole her sense of safety and her career, the way they used her to get to me—had devastating effects\non her and as my family watched her grou more isolated and more physically ill from the stress\nof all of it, we all felt pouerless. It was heartbreaking and infuriating, and we later learned hou\noften this patern was repeated. A young person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in\nby Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try to piece together a life in the aftermath\nof this trauma that left them feeling distrustful and fearful. Most of these individuals had families\nwho were also negatively impacted as they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved\none’s losses and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure.\n\nMaxwell had many opportunities to come clean, but instead continued to make choices that\ncaused more harm. When my sister and I first spoke out to the media about what happened to us,\nMaxwell lied about us and threatened Maria, thus helping shut doun investigations into Epstein’s\nbehavior so they could together continue to harm children and young women. After this atempt\nto alert people to Epstein and Maxwell’s abusive behavior, I avoided being public about it for\nalmost two decades. My shame told me that I should hide this fact because it was embarrassing.\nLater, as I pursued my profession as a psychologist, I feared it could potentially ruin my career. I\nworried clients would not want to work with me if I was associated with this story wrongly labeled\nas one of “child prostitution.” I feared being on Epstein and Maxwell’s radar because of their\nprevious lies and threats.\n\n2 of 3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page3of7\nopinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Fed.

Discussion\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defense argues that the Government’s motion is\n“premature” because the Government’s arguments are about the relevance and prejudice of the\nwitnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the reliability of their methods under Rule 7o2.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011182.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 3 of lo\ndefendant claimed that the Government’s supplemental leter was untimely and simultaneously\nsupplemented the defendant’s expert notice for Forensic Examiner Robert Kelso. Notwithstanding\nthe anticipated objections, the defendant waited more than a week and filed a motion to preclude\nat approximately 9:45 p.m. the night before Flatley is expected to testify.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\n“The Federal Rules of Evidence allou the admission of fact testimony so long as the\nwitness has personal knouledge, while opinion testimony can be presented by either a lay or expert\nwitness.” United States v. Cuti, 72o F.3d 453, 457-58 (2d Cir. 2ol3). “The initial question is\ntherefore whether the contested testimony should be characterized as fact or opinion,” which is a\ndistinction that is “at best, one of degree.” Jd. at 458. The admission of fact testimony is governed\nby Federal Rule of Evidence 6o2, which requires that the witness have “personal knouledge of the\nmater.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o2. The admission of expert testimony is governed by Rule 7o2, and\napplies to witness who offer opinions who are “qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill,\nexperience, training or education.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nWhere a witness will offer expert testimony, the Federal Rules require the proponent to\n“describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s\nqualifications.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G), (b)(l)(C). As the l993 amendments to Rule l6 note,\nthe Rule is meant to “minimize surprise that often results from <span class=\"highlight\">unexpected</span> expert testimony,\nreduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the\nmerit of the expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Jd. l993 Amend. “Ifa party\nfails to comply with Rule l6, the district court has broad discretion in fashioning a remedy ... .”\nUnited States vy. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, ll5 (2d Cir. 2ol7), abrogated on other grounds by\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 8 of lo\nthe lines of the defense expert notice.\n\nFourth, preclusion of any of Flatley’s testimony is an improper remedy. As set forth above,\nFlatley’s testimony does not constitute expert opinion, and thus no notice was required. But even\nif some aspect of Flatley’s testimony were considered expert opinion, the Government’s notice\nwas sufficient, for the reasons set forth above. Furthermore, the purpose of Rule l6’s expert notice\nrequirement is to “minimize surprise that often results from <span class=\"highlight\">unexpected</span> expert testimony, reduce\nthe need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of\nthe expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G),\n(b)(l)(C), l993 Amend. Here, the Government’s notices have clearly served the purpose of the\nrequirement. The defendant cannot seriously claim surprise: When the Government first provided\nnotice of Flatley’s testimony in September, the defendant did not object to its sufficiency or file a\nmotion to preclude, but instead noticed her oun counter-expert to Flatley on November l, 2o2l,\nstating that he would testify about substantially the same subjects. Moreover, the first time the\ndefendant raised any complaint about notice, the Government responded in great detail within\nthree days, and the defense then chose to wait until the night before Flatley’s testimony to raise\nany further complaint with the Court. Thus, any need for a continuance—and there is none—is\nthe product of the defendant’s gamesmanship. Preclusion is an extreme remedy, see Ulbricht, 858\nF.3d at ll7; Canada, 858 F. App’x at 439; Ganier, 468 F.3d at 927 (“District courts should\nembrace the ‘least severe sanction necessary’ doctrine, and hold that suppression of relevant\nevidence as a remedial device should be limited to circumstances in which it is necessary to serve\nremedial objectives.”); United States v.

Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\nrecreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, <span class=\"highlight\">unexpected</span> incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC.
