September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.”°’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOIA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”””8 Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy. The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”*??

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l75 of 375\n\nAmerican Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, Chicago, IL\n\n2oo7 Forensic Psychiatry Review Course\nAmerican Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, Miami Beach, FL\n\n2oo8 Florida Forensic Examiner Training\nUniversity of South Florida College of Behavioral and Community\nSciences, Ft.

They do not reveal new sources\nof their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein’s death. They do not reveal\nthe path of the Government’s investigation.\n\nInsofar as the motion to unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine\nlode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they definitively are\nnot that. A “public official,” “lawmaker,” “pundit,” or “ordinary citizen” “deeply interested and\nconcerned about the Epstein mater,” Motion to Unseal at 3, and who reviewed these materials\nexpecting, based on the Government’s representations, to learn new information about Epstein’s\nand Maxwell’s crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed\nand misled. There is no “there” there.\n\nThis case is thus a far cry from every reported case applying the Second Circuit’s\n“special circumstances” doctrine. In each such case, the petition to unseal, whether granted or\ndenied, sought unique, undisclosed information. That information generally consisted of\nfirsthand testimony from a public figure or a witness to an important event. See, e.g., In re\nBiaggi, 478 F.2d at 49o-9l (granting petition to unseal grand jury testimony of New York City\nmayoral <span class=\"highlight\">candidate</span> Mario Biaggi); /n re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol (denying petition to unseal l948\ngrand jury testimony of Harry Dexter White, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury accused of\nbeing a Communist spy); /n re Petition of Nat’l Sec.

None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral <span class=\"highlight\">candidate</span>, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\nAmendment. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 25 of 3l\ntestimony of mayoral <span class=\"highlight\">candidate</span> exposing as false his representation to the public that he had\nanswered all questions before grand jury). And the Government’s stated rationale for its motion\nbears no resemblance to any “grounds that justify disclosure under the existing exceptions listed\nin Rule 6(e).” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nIn arguing that this factor favors disclosure, the Government makes broad proclamations\nabout the public’s interest in learning more about the Epstein-Maxwell investigation. See Gov’t\nMem. at 5 (“Many questions remain unanswered, and the public’s interest remains.” (quoting Jn\nre AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 294)). That interest is undeniable. But the Government has failed to\nconnect it to the materials at issue, which would not answer any of the public’s questions.\n\nThis factor decisively weighs against unsealing.\n\n4, What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\n“The specificity of the data sought is significant in at least two ways.” In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6.\n\nFirst, there are obvious differences between releasing one witness’[s] testimony,\n\nthe full transcript, or merely the minutes of the proceeding. And, second, it is highly\n\nrelevant whether the disclosure is general or limited to a specified number of people\n\nunder special circumstances.\n\nId. at lo6—lo7 (citation omited).\n\nHere, the Government does not seek tailored disclosure of discrete items within a grand\njury record. Nor does it seek leave to disseminate grand jury materials to a specified audience.\nIt seeks disclosure to the public at large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury,\nsubject only to redactions aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nThis factor weighs against unsealing. The Government has identified no information of\nconsequence within the grand jury record that is not already public. And, under Jn re Craig, the\nblanket quality of the motion to unseal weighs against unsealing.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021407.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 333 3536o38, Page235 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 233 of 348\nA, September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.”””’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOIA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”?”> Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy.

Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate.

Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024660.jpg": "Page ll\nee a 54-year-old White Male.

Cellmate Assignments:\nInmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department\nhead meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings. The Captain, Associate Wardens,\nWarden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s\natorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health. Psychology Services are involved in making\nrecommendations regarding the types of cellmates with whom inmates at-risk for suicidality should celled.\nPsychology Services takes into consideration the suicide risk factors involved with a particular inmate and shares\ntheir knouledge with Executive Staff.\nThe psychological reconstruction team suggests MCC New York Executive Staff did not take into account Mr.\nEpstein’s sex offender-specific needs in assigning him a cellmate in SHU. Houever, that is not correct. MCC New\nYork Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein,\nincluding but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.\nPrior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology\nstaff, assessed all the inmates in SHU at that time and narroued the list doun to the most appropriate candidates.\nthe other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be\nhoused with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses? \"© ]was deemed\ndangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narroued the\npossibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-o54, was placed in SHU for claims\nhe was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.\nBased on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate\nin SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York\nExecutive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators\nwho are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.\n4.

Many of\n7 the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n7 of l8 commits @ felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberio Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.

The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.””? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”°°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... I am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\ncoordinate hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.

The SHU\nLieutenant confirmed that a BOP psychologist told him that Epstein had to be housed with a cellmate when\nEpstein returned to the SHU and said that he passed the directive doun to the SHU staff.\nAdditionally, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9, 2ol9, said he and all other SHU staff were\naware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. MCC New York Psychology Department personnel told the OIG\nthat MCC New York staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement because it was discussed during\nstaff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and during required\nstaff training.\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l said she explained to the\natorney that Epstein needed to have a cellmate because he was housed in the SHU and he was a\nsex offender.\nVI. Selection of Epstein’s Cellmate After Psychological Observation\nThe Captain told the OIG that he compiled a list of possible cellmates for Epstein, veted those inmates, and\nprovided the list of names to the MCC New York Warden. The Warden told the OIG that he identified two\npotential cellmates and tentatively decided on Inmate 3. The Warden said he passed this information on to\nthe BOP Director's Chief of Staff and later received word that he should assign Inmate 3 to be\nEpstein’s cellmate.\nThe Warden told the OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to replace Inmate 3 if he left MCC New York. The\nWarden and the Captain told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would\nhave had to review a new list of potential cell mate candidates to ensure that Epstein was housed with an\nappropriate inmate. According to the Warden and the Captain, if Inmate 3 was no longer detained at MCC\nNew York, SHU staff should have informed a Lieutenant on duty, who should have informed the Captain,\nwho would have ensured that the process of selecting a new cellmate for Epstein would begin.\nVil. Epstein’s Cell Assignment from July 3o to August lo\nAs a result of Epstein’s cellmate requirement, on July 3o, 2ol9, follouing his release from psychological\nobservation, Epstein was initially assigned to cell Zo4-2o6 with Inmate 3 in the J Tier of the SHU.2° A BOP\n26 SENTRY, which is BOP’s database of information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline,\nand programs of inmates, inaccurately reflected that this move from his psychological observation cell to the SHU\noccurred the previous day (July 29, 2ol9). The investigation revealed that Epstein was originally scheduled to return to\nthe SHU on July 29, 2ol9, but, at his request, he remained on psychological observation until July 3o, 2ol9.\nSENTRY was not updated to reflect either the actual date of Epstein’s transfer back into the SHU or the cell to which he\nand Inmate 3 were assigned after the initial cell change necessitated by the electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device.\nThe administrative error in BOP’s SENTRY records regarding Epstein’s cell assignment had no effect on the events the\nOIG investigated and reviewed.\nAccording to OIG interviews with MCC New York staff members, it does not appear that there were any checks to ensure\n\nContinued\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023468.tif": "shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.®° The OIG found that the failure of these\nindividuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been\non suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance\nfailure.\n3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cell mate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cell mate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028902.tif": "wesc THE PALM BEACH POST = * WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 2oo6 55\nPolice key h on h airpc ifted through trash\n-Folice kept watch on home, airport, sifted through tras\nsaid.

Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epsiein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n: of l8 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.
