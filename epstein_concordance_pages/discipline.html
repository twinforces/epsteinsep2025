Nathan\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool43o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l5-3 Filed o7/o8/2o Page 2 of 2\n\nappearing before this Court are subject to the Local Rules of this Court, including the Rules\ngoverning <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> of atorneys.\nDate:\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nAlison J.

No. 42 at 5. In a footnote, the\ndefense clarifies that “[a]s long as Ms. Maxwell is monitored in the same manner, and receives\nthe same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is not necessary to move her to the general\npopulation.” Dkt. No. 42 at 5 n.4.\n\nThe Court sees no basis for granting the Defendant’s request for an order directed to\nBOP. First, the Government has assured the Court that “[a]s with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff,” thereby ensuring that Ms. Maxwell’s ability to communicate with her counsel is in\nno way interfered. Dkt. No. 4l at 4n.5. And as to the more general implementation of\nsurveillance procedures, the Court credits BOP’s duty to ensure the safety and security of the\nDefendant as justifying the measures BOP has adopted. See Bell v. Wolfish, 44l U.S. 52o, 547\n(l979) (‘Prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption\nand execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\norder and <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> and to maintain institutional security.”). Nor does the Defendant provide\nany basis for the Court to conclude that the level of surveillance is punitive. Dkt. No. 42 at 5.\nThough pretrial detainees “may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance\nwith due process of law,” Wolfish, 44l U.S. at 535, it does not follou that surveillance measures\nare punitive just because the Defendant deems them “onerous.” Dkt. No. 42 at 4. The\nDefendant has provided the Court with no evidence, and no reason to believe, that the\nsurveillance measures are motivated by improper purposes.\n\nAs aresult, Defendant’s request is denied. To ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to\ncontinue to adequately participate in her defense, houever, the Court hereby ORDERS the\nGovernment to provide writen status updates every 9o days detailing any material changes to the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool745\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document l82-4 Filed o3/26/2l Page 2 of 2\n\nAll atorneys appearing before this Court are subject to the Local Rules of this Court, including\nthe Rules governing <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> of atorneys.\nDated:\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR- oooo333l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l57 of 348\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004020.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 248 Filed o4/26/2l Page3of9\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So, 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?° Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l58 of 349\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l5 Filed o7/3o/2l Page2of3\nCourt. Dkt. No. 3l4. Rule 23.l is not so superficial nor easily circumvented. Nothing in the\nrule limits its application to lawyers who have formally noticed an appearance. To the contrary,\nas the text throughout the rule makes clear, it applies to statements made by lawyers (and others)\n“associated” with “pending or imminent criminal litigation.” S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule\n23.l(a) (last updated Oct. 29, 2ol8); see also Rule 23.l(b) (“a lawyer participating in or\nassociated with the investigation’); Rule 23.l(c) (“lawyer or law firm associated with the\nprosecution or defense”). An atorney need not be of record in order to be sufficiently\n“associated” with a case as to justify application of disciplinary rules regarding extrajudicial\nstatements. Lawyers who have not filed a formal notice of appearance may still possess\ninformation that lends a perception by the public that their remarks on a pending case hold\ngreater authority. See In re Hinds, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (N.J. l982); see also People v. Butafuoco,\n599 N.Y.S.2d 4l9 (Nassau Cty. Ct. l993).\n\nSuch is the case with Mr. Markus’s role in the pending mater. As noted, Mr. Markus has\natended a proceeding in this Court, after which he spoke to the press on Ms. Maxwell’s behalf.\nHe has represented Ms. Maxwell on appeals of this Court’s pre-trial bail determinations.\nMoreover, Mr. Markus has identified himself as Ms. Maxwell’s appellate lawyer in a published\nop-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case. These facts mean that the public, which\nincludes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an authoritative source of information\nregarding the pending mater and may readily consider his remarks to be accurate and reliable.\nMr. Markus is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and\nthe Court declines to consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity\nwith respect to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l5 _ Filed o7/3o/2l Page3of3\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that “presumptively involve a substantial likelihood\nthat their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due\nadministration of justice within the meaning of the rule.” S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23(d).\n\nGoing forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated with the pending case are nou\nclearly on notice that their conduct falls under the purview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed,\nthe above concerns do not apply only to Mr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that\n“counsel[,] agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses” must take care to “protect\nthe Defendant’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.” Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant\nthat criminal maters heading touard trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All\nthose associated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they risk\nbeing deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of the upcoming\ntrial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h). In addition to the impact it could have on this\nmater, failure to comply could also result in atorney <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>. /d.

There are cameras on her constantly, most are stationary,\nbut one camera follous her as she moves throughout the facility, and is constantly surveilling\nher, even during confidential atorney-client conferences. Ms. Maxwell has reported to counsel\nand the BOP that she has been threatened by corrections officers that she will be subject to\n<span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> if she is ever out of, or anything interferes with, the camera’s view.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subject to numerous pat searches per day, despite being completely\nisolated, during which she alleges to have been touched in a sexually inappropriate manner by\ncorrections officers on multiple occasions. She declines recreation time to avoid being searched,\nwhich has negatively impacted her physical health. She was denied an extra blanket in the\nwinter, and, on more than one occasion, an officer took one of her blankets from her after her\nrequest for an extra blanket was granted. She was not provided a proper food regimen for the\nfirst few months she was incarcerated, wherein she was provided with small, inadequate portions\nor roten food. She has lost at least l5 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair\nloss. Currently, she suffers from headaches and back pain and general physical weakness.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s guards shine flashlights on the ceiling of her cell in l5-minute intervals\nand have done so every night since she has been incarcerated. As reported by the government,\n“MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes because the defendant, while not on\nsuicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule because MDC has identified a number of\nfactors that raise heightened safety and security concerns with respect to this defendant.” (Dkt.\n27o.) This response provides further support that Ms. Maxwell is overmanaged because of the\nintense criticism sustained by the Department of Justice over the Bureau of Prison’s blunders that\nresulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein, an event that preceded the arrest and prosecution of Ms.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 373 of 375\nCURRICULUM VITAE\nJennifer L.

The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. <span class=\"highlight\">Discipline</span> was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary.

Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. <span class=\"highlight\">Discipline</span> was reversed.”\nl2.

Quite the contrary. The policies and actions\nimplemented to detain Ms. Maxwell violated clearly established rights of inmates to be free from\npunishment and unreasonable searches. Courts have been confronted with cases challenging\nconditions of confinement in the MDC. See Turkman v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 2l8 (2d Cir. 2ol5), which\ninvolved many of the same challenges to conditions of confinement.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Ms. Maxwell’s detention was far more arduous and constituted\na more serious penalty than conventional detention is general population. While the hardship of\nimprisonment is normally measured in quantitative terms, i.e., by the length of the prison term, the\nhardship and deprivations experienced by Ms. Maxwell also had a qualitative aspect. The\ndifference between Ms. Maxwell’s isolation and typical prison conditions is so pronounced that\nthey differ not only in degree but in nature.

She ls\ncurrently housed in segregation from all other inmates, reportedly with a team of lo correction\nofficers at a time — three officers are on duty from 7am until 8pm, and two officers from 8pm\nuntil 7am — groups of which rotate on a bi-weekly basis and many of the officers are reportedly\noften hostile touard her. here are cameras on her constantly, some are stationary and one\ncamera is on wheels and follous her as she moves throughout the facility. Ms. Maxwell\nreported that she has been threatened by correction officers that she will be subject to\n<span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> if she is ever out of the camera’s view.\n\nMs. Maxwell reported that she is subject to numerous pat searches per day, despite\nbeing completely isolated, during which she alleges to have been touched in a sexually\ninappropriate manner by correction officers on multiple occasions. Ms. Maxwell reported that\nin January of 2o2l, a correction officer grabbed her breast with intense pressure during a\nroutine pat search, causing her significant discomfort and pain. She reported that she often\nrefuses to go to recreation to avoid being searched, which has negatively impacted her physical\nhealth because she is unable to get fresh air or exercise. She was reportedly denied an extra\nblanket in the winter and on more than one occasion an officer took one of her blankets from\nher after her request for an extra blanket was granted. She further reported that she was not\nprovided a proper food regimen for the first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she\nwas provided with small, inadequate portions or roten food. She has reportedly lost at least\nl5 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair loss. She reported that currently,\nshe suffers from constant headaches and back pain.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subject to flashlights being shined on the ceiling of her cell in l5-minute\nintervals every night since she has been incarcerated. A leter authored by U.S. Atorney\nAudrey Strauss states, “...

Ms. Maxwell reported that these flashlight checks have\nsignificantly hindered her ability to sleep, as she frequently wakes up every time the guards\nshine the flashlight into her cell.

Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in\norder to determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations,\ndeemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l). (See, e.g., Commercial Standard\nTitle Co. v. Superior Court (l979) 92 Cal.App.3d 934, 945 [l55 Cal.Rptr.393].)\nLawyer-client confidentiality encompasses the lawyer-client privilege, the work-product\ndoctrine and ethical standards of confidentiality\n[2] The principle of lawyer-client confidentiality applies to information a lawyer\nacquires by virtue of the representation, whatever its source, and encompasses maters\ncommunicated in confidence by the client, and therefore protected by the lawyer-client\nprivilege, maters protected by the work product doctrine, and maters protected under\nethical standards of confidentiality, all as established in law, rule and policy. (See /n the\nMater of Johnson (Rev. Dept. 2ooo) 4 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. l79; Goldstein v. Lees\n(l975) 46 Cal.App.3d 6l4, 62l [l2o Cal.Rptr. 253].) The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion. Thus, a lawyer may not\nreveal such information except with the informed consent* of the client or as authorized\nor required by the State Bar Act, these rules, or other law.\n\nNarrou exception to duty of confidentiality under this rule\n[3] Notwithstanding the important public policies promoted by lawyers adhering to\nthe core duty of confidentiality, the overriding value of life permits disclosures otherwise\nprohibited by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).\nParagraph (b) is based on Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(2), which narrouly permits a lawyer to disclose information protected by Business\nand Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) even without client consent.\nEvidence Code section 956.5, which relates to the evidentiary lawyer-client privilege,\nsets forth a similar express exception. Although a lawyer is not permited to reveal\ninformation protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) concerning a client’s past,\ncompleted criminal acts, the policy favoring the preservation of human life that underlies\nthis exception to the duty of confidentiality and the evidentiary privilege permits\ndisclosure to prevent a future or ongoing criminal act.\nLawyer not subject to <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span> for revealing information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited under this rule\n[4] Paragraph (b) reflects a balancing between the interests of preserving client\nconfidentiality and of preventing a criminal act that a lawyer reasonably believes”* is\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Pagellof l4\nlikely to result in death or substantial* bodily harm to an individual.

Among the factors to be considered in determining\nwhether to disclose information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) are the\nfollouing:\n\n(l) the amount of time that the lawyer has to make a decision about\ndisclosure;\n\n(2) whether the client or a third-party has made similar threats before and\nwhether they have ever acted or atempted to act upon them;\n\n(3) whether the lawyer believes* the lawyer's efforts to persuade the client or\na third person* not to engage in the criminal conduct have or have not\nbeen successful;\n\n(4) the extent of adverse effect to the client’s rights under the Fifth, Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and analogous\nrights and privacy rights under Article | of the Constitution of the State of\nCalifornia that may result from disclosure contemplated by the lawyer;\n\n(5) the extent of other adverse effects to the client that may result from\ndisclosure contemplated by the lawyer; and\n\n(6) the nature and extent of information that must be disclosed to prevent the\ncriminal act or threatened harm.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l4 of l4\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognizes the concern that informing a client about\nlimits on confidentiality may have a chilling effect on client communication. (See\nComment [l].) To avoid that chilling effect, one lawyer may choose to inform the client\nof the lawyer’s ability to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l)\nas early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform\na client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within\nparagraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer\natempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7]. In each situation, the\nlawyer will have satisfied the lawyer’s obligation under paragraph (c)(2), and will not be\nsubject to <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>.\n\nInforming client that disclosure has been made; termination of the lawyer-client\nrelationship\n[ll] When a lawyer has revealed information protected by Business and Professions\nCode section 6o68, subdivision (e) as permited in paragraph (b), in all but extraordinary\ncases the relationship between lawyer and client that is based on trust and confidence\nwill have deteriorated so as to make the lawyer’s representation of the client impossible.\nTherefore, when the relationship has deteriorated because of the lawyer’s disclosure,\nthe lawyer is required to seek to withdraw from the representation, unless the client has\ngiven informed consent* to the lawyer’s continued representation. The lawyer normally\nmust inform the client of the fact of the lawyer’s disclosure. If the lawyer has a\ncompelling interest in not informing the client, such as to protect the lawyer, the lawyer’s\nfamily or a third person* from the risk of death or substantial* bodily harm, the lawyer\nmust withdraw from the representation. (See rule l.l6.)\nOther consequences of the lawyer's disclosure\n[l2] Depending upon the circumstances of a lawyer’s disclosure of information\nprotected by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as\npermited by this rule, there may be other important issues that a lawyer must address.\nFor example, a lawyer who is likely to testify as a witness in a mater involving a client\nmust comply with rule 3.7. Similarly, the lawyer must also consider his or her duties of\nloyalty and competence. (See rules l.7 and l.l.)\nOther exceptions to confidentiality under California law\n[l3] This rule is not intended to augment, diminish, or preclude any other exceptions\nto the duty to preserve information protected by Business and Professions Code section\n6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognized under California law.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll42o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 787-3 Filed o7/2l/25 Pageiofl\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, l:2o-CR-oo33o-PAE\nVS.\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL.\na\nPROPOSED ORDER FOR ADMISSION PRO HAC VICE\n\nThe motion of David Oscar Markus, for admission to practice Pro Hac Vice in\nthe above captioned action is granted.\n\nApplicant has declared that he is a member in good standing of the bar of the\nstate of Florida; and that his contact information is as follous:\n\nDavid Oscar Markus\nMARKUS/MOSS PLLC\n\n4o NW 38RD STREET, PHl\nMIAMI, FL 33l28\nTelephone: (3o5) 379-6667\nFax: (3o5) 379-6668\ndmarkus@markuslaw.com\n\nApplicant having requested admission Pro Hac Vice to appear for all purposes\nas counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell in the above entitled action;\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Applicant is admited to practice Pro Hac Vice\nin the above captioned case in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020429.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page43 of 9l\nfile those exhibits on the public docket without redaction by July 2, 2o2l (Signed by\nJudge Alison J.

[d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts.

Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n7o4 OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022033.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page lo of 38\nDe Any and all internal investigative reports created by the BOP as to both\ndefendants, including, any and all supporting memorandums, writen\nstatements, photos, videos, and incident reports\n| To date, the government has disclosed a multitude of discovery documents but those\n\ndocuments only relate to witness statements, video and incident reports concerning the events of\nAugust lo, 2ol9.

The defense believes that only one of four officers in that case was given only a minor\n(l4) day suspension. Moreover, although the government will argue that this incident is far\nremoved from the current incident, the defendant disagrees. Mr. Thomas knew some of the\nindividuals in that incident and he was well aware that their conduct did not lead to their\nindictment or incarceration. In fact, many of those officers did not receive as much as a\nreprimand for falsifying the same documents that Mr. Thomas is nou charged with a federal\ncrime for submiting. This goes to Mr. Thomas’ defense in this case. The defendant’s state of\nmind is always a material and relevant fact in any criminal case.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nI. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York.

MCC New York Psychology Department personnel told the OIG\nthat MCC New York staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement because it was discussed during\nstaff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and during required\nstaff training.\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l said she explained to the\natorney that Epstein needed to have a cellmate because he was housed in the SHU and he was a\nsex offender.\nVI. Selection of Epstein’s Cellmate After Psychological Observation\nThe Captain told the OIG that he compiled a list of possible cellmates for Epstein, veted those inmates, and\nprovided the list of names to the MCC New York Warden. The Warden told the OIG that he identified two\npotential cellmates and tentatively decided on Inmate 3. The Warden said he passed this information on to\nthe BOP Director's Chief of Staff and later received word that he should assign Inmate 3 to be\nEpstein’s cellmate.\nThe Warden told the OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to replace Inmate 3 if he left MCC New York. The\nWarden and the Captain told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would\nhave had to review a new list of potential cell mate candidates to ensure that Epstein was housed with an\nappropriate inmate. According to the Warden and the Captain, if Inmate 3 was no longer detained at MCC\nNew York, SHU staff should have informed a Lieutenant on duty, who should have informed the Captain,\nwho would have ensured that the process of selecting a new cellmate for Epstein would begin.\nVil. Epstein’s Cell Assignment from July 3o to August lo\nAs a result of Epstein’s cellmate requirement, on July 3o, 2ol9, follouing his release from psychological\nobservation, Epstein was initially assigned to cell Zo4-2o6 with Inmate 3 in the J Tier of the SHU.2° A BOP\n26 SENTRY, which is BOP’s database of information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, <span class=\"highlight\">discipline</span>,\nand programs of inmates, inaccurately reflected that this move from his psychological observation cell to the SHU\noccurred the previous day (July 29, 2ol9). The investigation revealed that Epstein was originally scheduled to return to\nthe SHU on July 29, 2ol9, but, at his request, he remained on psychological observation until July 3o, 2ol9.\nSENTRY was not updated to reflect either the actual date of Epstein’s transfer back into the SHU or the cell to which he\nand Inmate 3 were assigned after the initial cell change necessitated by the electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device.\nThe administrative error in BOP’s SENTRY records regarding Epstein’s cell assignment had no effect on the events the\nOIG investigated and reviewed.\nAccording to OIG interviews with MCC New York staff members, it does not appear that there were any checks to ensure\n\nContinued\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023754.tif": "An atorney may not call an inmate.

Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassigned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability.

Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring.
