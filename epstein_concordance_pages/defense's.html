SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000849.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defense's</span> papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE TESTIMONY ABOUT ANY ALLEGED\n“RAPE” BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN\nThe government argues that the expected testimony of [J that she was raped\nby Jeffrey Epstein is admissible to shou the “ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims” and is necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Resp. at\n79-8o. The government offers no explanation, houever, for why testimony of an alleged rape\nwould prove the relationship “between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when gay\nhas never claimed in her prior statements to the FBI or anywhere else that Ms. Maxwell knew of,\nfacilitated, or participated in the alleged rape in any way. Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes.

Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes.

The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v.

In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2l of l27 2l\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The defense also seeks to elicit evidence of the\n\n2 public outcry and scrutiny that preceded the decision to charge\n3 the defendant. The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases. Admiting testimony on the investigation would confuse\n24 the jury once it's received that instruction.\n25 Second, these lines of argument are likely to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007073.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 22 of l27 22\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl substantially confuse and delay the trial. The evidence\n\n2 outlined in the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> papers, including who was interviewed\n3 and when, what documents were subpoenaed and other details of\n\n4 investigations in two different states and different time\n\n5 periods would substantially expand the scope of the trial.\n\n6 Exactly what steps investigators took is not a simple question,\n7 of course. The government would likely present a contrary\n\n8 account of events, leading to trials within trials on what law\n9 enforcement did over the course of years. This prejudice would\nlo substantially outweigh any minimum probative value that might\nll be gained from such a far-flung endeavor.\n\nl2 Third, as to prejudice, the evidence would be\n\nl3 cumulative, demonstrating that an investigation was \"hasty\" and\nl4 not thorough is at best repetitive of the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> arguments\nl5 that the government collected insufficient evidence of guilt.\nl6 That point is made most clearly and directly by focusing on the\nl7 evidence or lack of evidence and credibility or lack of\n\nl8 credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.\n\nl9 The second piece of guidance I can provide nou is that\n2o the Court will exclude much of the evidence outlined in the\nal <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> papers of the government's alleged motives for\n22 investigating and charging Ms. Maxwell. This evidence includes\n23 but is not limited to the Miami Herald article, statements from\n24 Atorney General William Barr and the like.\n25 The evidence presented by the government in this trial\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007074.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 23 of l27 23\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl is the relevant basis for the jury's determination of guilt or\n2 innocence. Why and when the government conducted the\n\n3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the\n\n4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell or somehou fabricating evidence or suborning\n\n6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the\n7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.\n\n8 See, Regan, lo3 F.3d lo82. Absent that, the law is clear that\n9 for purposes of the jury, \"the government is not on trial.\"\n\nlo United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly suggestive of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular investigative step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 37 of l27 37\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl information including e-mails between the defendant and Jeffrey\n2 Epstein. It is difficult for the government to determine in\n\n3 the abstract what the defense might point to, but that night\n\n4 include, for example, a false exculpatory statement.

Al Farekh, 8lo F.App'x 2l, (2d Cir. 2o2o), the\n25 defense argued the government shouldn't be able to offer\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page loo of l27 loo\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl the defense to engage in the full set of questions that counsel\n2 has indicated, but for purposes of the in limine motion, it's\n\n3 denied.\n\n4 Defense l9. Here, the defense seeks to suppress\n\n5 alleged Victim-4's identification of Ms. Maxwell on the ground\n6 that the government used unduly suggestive photo array\n\n7 procedures that violate due process rights.\n\n8 I am prepared to deny this motion. Eyewitness\n\n9 identifications should be excluded when improper police conduct\nlo created a substantial likelihood of misidentification. Perry\nll v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, (2ol2).\n\nl2 I follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the\n\nl3 admissibility of identification evidence. First, I must\n\nl4 determine whether the pretrial identification procedures were\nl5 unduly suggestive. Some examples of suggestive procedures\n\nl6 include using a very small number of photographs, making\n\nl7 suggestive comments, or the display of the accused in a way\n\nl8 that so stood out from all other photographs to suggest to an\nl9 identifying eyewitness that the person was more likely to be\n2o the culprit. See, United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369,\n2l (2d Cir. l992).\n22 Looking at the photo array, neither the photos used or\n23 the procedure itself was unduly suggestive. The array\n24 contained a sufficient number of photos larger than many arrays\n25 that courts have held were not unduly suggestive. <span class=\"highlight\">Defense's</span>\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007165.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page ll4 of l27 ll4\nLBl5max4\n\nl accurate?\n\n2 THE DEFENDANT: Oh sorry.

I don't think that is\n\nll practical but I think especially because, in some instances, we\nl2 may be uploading to the defense through a file sharing program\nl3 certain disclosures on one day and they may be meeting with the\nl4 defendant in person the very next day, they certainly have the\nl5 ability to talk about those materials with the defendant, to\n\nl6 provide her with paper copies if they wish, and I think that is\nl7 more than sufficient.\n\nl8 THE COURT: Well, you are not suggesting that instead\nl9 of government sending the materials to the facility and working\n2o with the facility to facilitate timely movement of the\n2l materials to Ms. Maxwell, are you?\n22 MS.

In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 9 of 24 2l\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The defense also seeks to elicit evidence of the\n\n2 public outcry and scrutiny that preceded the decision to charge\n3 the defendant. The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases. Admiting testimony on the investigation would confuse\n24 the jury once it's received that instruction.\n25 Second, these lines of argument are likely to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page lo of 24 22\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl substantially confuse and delay the trial. The evidence\n\n2 outlined in the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> papers, including who was interviewed\n3 and when, what documents were subpoenaed and other details of\n\n4 investigations in two different states and different time\n\n5 periods would substantially expand the scope of the trial.\n\n6 Exactly what steps investigators took is not a simple question,\n7 of course. The government would likely present a contrary\n\n8 account of events, leading to trials within trials on what law\n9 enforcement did over the course of years. This prejudice would\nlo substantially outweigh any minimum probative value that might\nll be gained from such a far-flung endeavor.\n\nl2 Third, as to prejudice, the evidence would be\n\nl3 cumulative, demonstrating that an investigation was \"hasty\" and\nl4 not thorough is at best repetitive of the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> arguments\nl5 that the government collected insufficient evidence of guilt.\nl6 That point is made most clearly and directly by focusing on the\nl7 evidence or lack of evidence and credibility or lack of\n\nl8 credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.\n\nl9 The second piece of guidance I can provide nou is that\n2o the Court will exclude much of the evidence outlined in the\nal <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> papers of the government's alleged motives for\n22 investigating and charging Ms. Maxwell. This evidence includes\n23 but is not limited to the Miami Herald article, statements from\n24 Atorney General William Barr and the like.\n25 The evidence presented by the government in this trial\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page ll of 24 23\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl is the relevant basis for the jury's determination of guilt or\n2 innocence. Why and when the government conducted the\n\n3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the\n\n4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell or somehou fabricating evidence or suborning\n\n6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the\n7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.\n\n8 See, Regan, lo3 F.3d lo82. Absent that, the law is clear that\n9 for purposes of the jury, \"the government is not on trial.\"\n\nlo United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly suggestive of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular investigative step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document558 Filed l2/l9/2l Page2of5\n\nAt the outset, it bears noting that the public interest in viewing the parties’ presentations is\nmarginal.

You'll see it\nl3 doesn't change anything I've said. Jane's lawyer told the\nl4 prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying\nl5 would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help\nl6 her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that\nl7 prosecutor occurred in 2o2l, long after Jane's civil case was\nl8 setled, long after she already received her award from the\nl9 fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the Lawyer meant\n2o by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any\n2l financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money\n22 to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell\n23 you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome\n24 of this trial.

They concede that the sexual contact happened with\n\n4 Epstein, but the theory is, Maxwell just had no part in it,\n\n5 wasn't involved. So the theory is that all four of these women\n6 had a massive false memory event that just happen to include\n\n7 details of the defendant grooming them in the same way using\n\n8 the same playbook. Your common sense tells you that didn't\n\n9 happen. The <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> oun expert, Professor Loftus, confirmed\nlo that the core memories of trauma are solid.

She\n22 was the core memory, she was essential to this scheme. And to\n23 distract you from the remarkable clarity with which these women\n24 remember those core details, the defense primarily points to\n25 hou Jane and Carolyn have described aspects of their\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l7o of 257 3oo4\nLCKCmax7 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl What year was it that I ruined that pie and it was salty? Just\n2 because you can't remember exactly hou old you were, which\n\n3 Thanksgiving it was, does that mean it didn't happen? Of\n\n4 course not.\n\n5 The same is true of Jane and Carolyn. The abuse\n\n6 stands out in their mind because it was formative, but it\n\n7 happened so often that the details run together.

It's less like Thanksgiving\n\nl5 for her and more like a sweet l6 party, something unique that\nl6 only happens once, so it stands out much more clearly in every\nl7 detail.\n\nl8 For Jane and Carolyn, even though some of those\n\nl9 peripheral details got jumbled, they have solid memories of the\n2o core events. And you knou from the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> oun expert that\n2l when an event you're remembering is traumatic, not just some\n22 holiday, the memory is going to be even stronger.\n23 Like Jane, she remembers Maxwell being in the room.\n24 The presence of a woman that she had looked up to like an older\n25 sister during this horrifying sexual abuse is a traumatic core\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7l9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017200.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l79 of 257 3ol3\nLCKVMAX8 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl Maxwell was exactly who Alessi said she was.

The <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> only explanation for why\n\n5 they would perjure themselves on that stand is money. But the\n6 facts just do not support that.

You'll see it\nl3 doesn't change anything I've said. Jane's lawyer told the\nl4 prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying\nl5 would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help\nl6 her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that\nl7 prosecutor occurred in 2o2l, long after Jane's civil case was\nl8 setled, long after she already received her award from the\nl9 fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the Lawyer meant\n2o by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any\n2l financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money\n22 to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell\n23 you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome\n24 of this trial.

I received a leter\n\n2 briefing over the weekend regarding the government's request\n\n3 for a limiting instruction with respect to the next anticipated\n4 witness. The witness will testify under the pseudonym Kate.\n\n5 As the government has indicated, because Kate was over\n6 the age of consent in all relevant jurisdictions at the time\n\n7 that she alleges sexual conduct with Epstein took place, she's\n8 not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment. On this\n9 basis the defense moved pretrial to exclude her testimony as\n\nlo irrelevant and prejudicial. I denied that request. I\n\nll concluded based on the government's proffer that she has\n\nl2 relevant testimony that is direct evidence of the Mann Act\n\nl3 counts and evidence that is otherwise admissible under 4o4(b).\nl4 To avoid jury confusion and prejudice, houever, I\n\nl5 concluded that her testimony should be limited in the\n\nl6 description of details of the sexual conduct that does not form\nl7 a basis of the charged counts and that a Limiting instruction\nl8 was required.\n\nl9 Over the weekend, the government asked for me to\n2o include in the limiting instruction a statement that I\n2l instructed the parties not to ask about details of the sexual\n22 conduct that the witness will testify occurred with\n23 Mr. Epstein.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019703.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagelo of l9\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defense's</span> papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019755.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2o-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defense's</span> papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defense's</span> papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019805.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt.

But when\n2l you review the totality of the circumstances -- the defendant's\n22 extensive international ties, her conduct over the past year,\n23 her unknoun finances and unwillingness to be more candid with\n24 the court about her resources to flee, her specific bail\n25 proposal which provides absolutely no security to the court --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9996\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020012.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel53 of 2oo 9o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl evidentiary hearing within one week. In contrast, the\n\n2 defendant is in the same position as any newly indicted\n\n3 defendant who is incarcerated in terms of the need to access\n\n4 counsel. Indeed the <span class=\"highlight\">defense's</span> logic, all pretrial detainees\n\n5 currently incarcerated at MDC and any federal facility would\n\n6 need to be released to prepare their defense. To the contrary,\n7 the MDC has continued to develop procedures to ensure\n\n8 atorney-client access at the facility, and the defendants\n\n9 detained at MDC are able to conduct video and phone conferences\nlo with their atorneys. There is ongoing litigation before\n\nll Judge Brodie in the Eastern District of New York about the\n\nl2 adequacy of atorney-client access at the MDC. That is case\n\nl3 No. l9 Civ. 66o. Public filings from the court-appointed\n\nl4 mediator in that case describe the availability of legal phone\nl5 calls and video calls, video conferences for the purposes of\n\nl6 reviewing discovery between detained defendants and their\n\nl7 counsel, and that same report indicates that MDC is currently\nl8 developing a plan to resume in-person atorney-client visits in\nl9 the near future.\n2o At this stage in this case and at this point in the\n2l pandemic in New York City, these measures are sufficient to\n22 ensure Ms. Maxwell has access to her counsel.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defense's</span> papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel4 of 9l\n\nlo/o7/2o2o | 62 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 6o Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court approve the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure of these Materials...

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defense's</span> papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020501.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel5 of 92\n\nlo/o7/2o2o 62 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 6o Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court approve the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure of these Materials...

These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defense's</span> papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
