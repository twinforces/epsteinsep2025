On both points, we disagree and hold that\nthe District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the\ncharges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to\ndismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.”°\n\nFirst, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly\napplied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that\nCongress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific\n© l8 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nunder the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, or for\nten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”\n2o United States v.

In 2oo3, Congress\namended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would\notherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years shall\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.”*° The text of\n§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it\nprevent the application of any statute of limitations that would\notherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nThe statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend\nthe time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as\nthe prior statute of limitations was inadequate.

Counts Three and Four thus qualify as\noffenses, and § 3283 applies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four,\nand Six of the Indictment are barred by the statute of\nlimitations because the extended statute of limitations\nprovided by the 2oo3 amendment to § 3283 does not\napply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v.

For statutes dealing with\nprior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves\n‘practical’ purposes: It promotes judicial and adminis-\ntrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past\nconvictions in minitrials conducted long after the fact.”\nMoncrieffe v.

Maxwell\nnonetheless contends that using a _ case-specific\napproach for § 3283 would be impractical because the\nGovernment would need to prove conduct beyond the\nelements of the offense. It may be true that this\napproach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense\npresents factual issues (including, at least, when the\nalleged conduct took place). This is not a serious\npractical problem and does not justify seting aside the\nstatute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States,\n346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this Court to cast\nWeingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges\naddressed a statute that extended the limitations\nperiod for defrauding the United States during the\nSecond World War. In that case, the Supreme Court\nfirst concluded that making false statements at an\nimmigration hearing was not subject to the extended\nlimitations period because it lacked any pecuniary\nelement as required by the statute. Id. at 22l. Then, as\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000129.jpg": "66a\n\nan alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential\ningredient.” Jd. at 222.

Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In\npassing recent statutes related to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse,\nincluding extensions of the § 3283 limitations period,\nCongress ‘evinced a general intention to “cast a wide\nnet to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”” Id. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at\nl96 (quoting United States v.

The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of\nlimitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged\nconduct took place before the PROTECT Act’s enactment,\nthat statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations\napplicable to her alleged offenses.

Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a _ two-step\nframework to determine whether a federal statute\napplies to past conduct. See Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994). Courts look first to\nthe language of the statute. If the statute states that\nit applies to past conduct, courts must so apply it.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute\napplies to past conduct unless doing so would create\nimpermissible retroactive effects. Id.\n\nThe Court begins with Landgraf’s first step. To\nassess a statute’s meaning here, courts must consider\nthe text of the statute along with other indicia of\ncongressional intent, including the statute’s history\nand structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC,\nSec. Litig. v. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol,\n4o6 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act,\nbroadly states that “[nlo statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping,\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years shall preclude such\nprosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” The statute\nlacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this\nparticular statute. See Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at 923.\nThe statute’s plain language unambiguously requires\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool3o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000131.jpg": "68a\n\nthat it apply to prosecutions for offenses commited\nbefore the date of enactment. Instead of simply\nproviding a new limitations period for future conduct,\nCongress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses\nwill apply. That is, it prevents the application of any\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise apply to\npast conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other\nstatutes employing similar language. The Eighth\nCircuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283,\nwhich alloued prosecution of sex crimes against\nchildren until the victim reached age twenty-five,\napplied to past conduct. See United States v. Jeffries,\n4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second\nCircuit has observed that the Higher Education\nTechnical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26,\nlo5 Stat. l23, illustrates language that requires a\nstatute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That\nstatute eliminated the statute of limitations for claims\non defaulted student loans by stating that “no\nlimitation shall terminate the period within which suit\nmay be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is\nquite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to\napply the extended limitations period as broadly as the\nConstitution allous. With each successive amendment\nto the statute, Congress further extended the limitations\nperiod, recognizing that sex crimes against children\n“may be difficult to detect quickly” because children\noften delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the\nlimitations provision of the PROTECT Act because it\nfound the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000132.jpg": "69a\nin many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-63, at 54\n(2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped\na <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> could not be prosecuted beyond this extended\nlimit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified\nhim as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned\n25.” Id.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s\ntext. Instead, she contends that because the House\nversion of the bill included an express retroactivity\nprovision absent from its final form, the Court should\ninfer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply\nto past conduct. Houever, the legislative history makes\nclear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have\nproduced unconstitutional results. The Supreme Court\nhas explained that a law that revives a time-barred\nprosecution violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the\nConstitution, but a law that extends an un-expired\nstatute of limitations does not. Stogner v. California,\n5389 U.S. 6o7, 632-83 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who\ncosponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in\na commitee report that the proposed retroactivity\nprovision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it\n“would have revived the government’s authority to\nprosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.”\nl49 Cong. Rec. $5l87, S5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3)\n(statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the\nprovision shortly thereafter for this reason. The\nremoval of the express retroactivity provision shous\nonly that Congress intended to limit the PROTECT\nAct to its constitutional applications, including past\nconduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of\nlimitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s\namendment to § 3283 reflect that it applies Maxwell’s\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool32", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000133.jpg": "7oa\nconduct charged in the $l superseding indictment.\nThe Court could stop here. Houever, it also concludes\nthat even if the statute were ambiguous, it would\nproperly apply to these charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether\napplication of the statute to past conduct would have\nimpermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has\npresumptively impermissible retroactive effects when\nit ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a\nnew duty, or ataches a new disability, in respect to\ntransactions or considerations already past.” Weingarten,\n865 F.3d at 56 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o).\nThus, applying a new statute of limitations to pre-\nviously time-barred claims has an impermissible\nretroactive effect.

Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within\nthe statute of limitations when Congress enacted the\nPROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any\nvested rights. Maxwell contends that it is unfair to\nallou the Government to prosecute her nou for\nconduct that occurred more than twenty years ago, but\nthere is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set\na lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at\nall. It has done so here, judging that the difficulty of\nprosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on\nchildren outweighs a defendant’s interest in repose.\nMaxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress's\npolicy judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive\napplication of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool33", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000137.jpg": "74a\n\n(2d Cir. l975).

See, e.g., July ll, 2oo8 Hr’g Tr. at 6-7\n(seeking an “[o]rder that the [non-prosecution] agreement that was negotiated is invalid” so that\nPetitioners can exercise the right to confer with the government); id. at l9-2o, 24; l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(5); see also DE l at 2 7 5 (claiming that Petitioner was “denied her rights” under the\nCVRA because she “received no consultation with the atorney for the government regarding the\npossible disposition of the charges”’).\n\nNotwithstanding the Non-Prosecution Agreement, Petitioners are and have been free to\nconfer with atorneys for the government about the investigation and potential prosecution of\nEpstein. At least one atorney for the government (Assistant United States Atorney Villafafia\nfrom the USAO-SDFL) had spoken to Petitioners about the offenses commited against them by\nEpstein prior to the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, see, e.g., July ll, 2oo8 Hr’g Tr.\nat 22 (acknouledging that prosecutors spoke to Petitioners “about what happened” to them); DE\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo3l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000317.jpg": "Case Si eae ese NDE See Ee driled S7/ DdeRet d7ans/aGief IBage l3 of\nbeen curtailed by the Non-Prosecution Agreement — to discuss the possibility of pursuing federal\ncriminal charges against Epstein.'* Nothing precludes Petitioners from doing so, and there is\nnothing to indicate that Petitioners’ wishes to confer with government atorneys in those districts\nwould be rebuffed in any way. Indeed, it would be rank speculation by Petitioners to contend\notherwise.\n\nHere, Petitioners have acknouledged that the best relief they can hope to obtain through\nthese proceedings is the ability to confer with the atorneys for the government. See, e.g., July\nll, 2oo8 Hr’g Tr. at 7 (agreeing that “the best [Petitioners] can get” is the “right to confer’’).\nYet, under the circumstances, a claim that Petitioners have been denied the opportunity to confer\nwith the atorney for the government about the filing and disposition of criminal charges against\nEpstein is premature and constitutionally unripe. “This is plainly the type of hypothetical case\nthat [a court] should avoid deciding.” Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc.\nv. Conger, 899 F.2d ll64, ll66 (llth Cir. l99o). Any speculation by Petitioners that they might\nprospectively be denied the opportunity to confer with the government about still-legally-viable\nfederal charges against Epstein simply cannot ripen Petitioners’ claims. See id. (recognizing that\ncourts “do not generally decide cases based on a party’s predicted conduct”).\n\nFor these reasons, Petitioners’ claims in these proceedings should be dismissed for lack\nof subject mater jurisdiction. See, e.g., In re Jacks, 642 F.3d l323, l332 (llth Cir. 2oll)\n(holding that claims that are “based on events that may take place in the future” are to be\n“dismissed for lack of jurisdiction”) (citing Greenbriar, Ltd. v.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000351.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page9oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\nharassed both [redacted] in connection to this atempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process\nall in violation of l8 USC l5l2(d)(l).”> Doe v.

Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000758.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 68 Filed o8/o4/25 Page 2 of 2\nAugust 4, 2o25 Page 2\nThank you so much for your time.\nI have atached the portion of the DOJ’s memo and link to their statement.\n[Consistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one\nthousand victims.

This includes specific details such as victim\nnames and likenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment\nhistory.\nOne of our highest priorities is combating <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation and bringing justice to victims.\nPerpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\nTo that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding\nEpstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is the\ndetermination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no\nfurther disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.]\nhtps ://www, justice .gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl? inline\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo758", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000773.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\nTailoring.\n\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, § 377l (a)(8)\nand the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 35o9(d)\nprinciples.\n\nWI. Requested Relief\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA 8§ 377l (a)(5), (c)(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo773", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000779.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document l-2, o7/23/2ol9, 26l4667, Page3 of 7\nEmail: mscavelli@steptoe.com\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Retained\nReid Weingarten\nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC)\nll4 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY loo36\n(2o2)—5o6—39oo\nFax: (2l2)-5o6—-395o\nEmail: rweingarten@steptoe.com\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Retained\nPending Counts Disposition\nl8:37l.F SEX TRAFFICKING\nCONSPIRACY\n(l)\nl8:l59l.F SEX TRAFFICKING\nOF CHILDREN OR BY FORCE,\nFRAUD OR COERCION\n(2)\nHighest Offense Level\n(Opening)\nFelony\nTerminated Counts Disposition\nNone\nHighest Offense Level\n(Terminated)\nNone\nComplaints Disposition\nNone\nPlaintiff\nUSA represented by Alex Rossmiller\nU.S. Atorney's Office, Southern District of\nNew York\nl St. Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\n(2l2)—637-24l5\nEmail: alexander.rossmiller@usdoj.gov\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nPRO HAC VICE\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Assistant US Atorney\nAlison Gainfort Moe\nUnited States Atorney's Office, SDNY\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\n(2l2)—637-2225\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo779", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000796.jpg": "Cas@-4Sol4-4646o- RM DbeuMenPsH l Pileg KV lsusaged gets oF 33 |\n|\n*lo (D.D.C.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo962", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000972.jpg": "Case F- 26-4 BOBSHAUR ID SeuMEeN IE Hied GPAB72o Pagers Gf 26o\nl.

Since Epstein’s arrest, she has been mentioned in\nliterally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content.

A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read:\n“WANTED: The Sun is offering a £lo,ooo reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal\nGhislaine Maxwell.”!° And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media\nreports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid\nquestioning by the FBI.'!

Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001180.jpg": "CaSese 2ot-ef o32os Aden (Decne) loo2l , RileiB 2ol d72Ge Rage Hof 2\nimportant to her than being connected.

As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l6 of 26\nl. Ms. Maxwell’s Personal History and Characteristics\nDemonstrate That She Is Not a Flight Risk\na. Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has\nSignificant Ties to the United States and the New York Region\nMs. Maxwell’s history and characteristics do not “strongly support detention,” as the\ngovernment contends (Gov. Mem. at 6), but instead demonstrate that she is firmly rooted in\nthis country and that her appearance can be reasonably assured with appropriate bail\nconditions. Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty-\nfive-year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the\npresent. Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this\ncountry for almost 3o years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2oo2. Ms. Maxwell\nalso has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign\nher bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-bom\ncitizens. Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with\nthem, as well as with her nieces and nephews. Ms. Maxwell also has numerous close\nfriends and professional colleagues who reside in this country. In sum, the United States has\nbeen Ms. Maxwell’s home for decades.\nb. Ms. Maxwell Has Actively Litigated Civil Cases in this District\nand Has Not Left the United States Since Epstein’s 2ol9 Arrest\nMs. Maxwell has never once atempted to “hide” from the government or her\naccusers, and has never shoun any intent to leave the country. To the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct\nrelated to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully\nintends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her. For example,\nsince 2ol5, and continuing through today, Ms. Maxwell has actively litigated several civil\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool596", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l9 of 26\ntake to protect herself, her family members, her friends and colleagues, and their children,\nfrom unrelenting and intrusive media coverage, threats, and irreparable reputational harm.\n\nEver since Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell has been at the center of a crushing\nonslaught of press articles, television specials, and social media posts painting her in the\nmost damning light possible and prejudging her guilt. The sheer volume of media reporting\nmentioning Ms. Maxwell is staggering. Since Epstein’s arrest, she has been mentioned in\nliterally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content. The media\natention also spawned a carnival-like atmosphere of speculation about her whereabouts. In\nNovember 2ol9, the British tabloid, The Sun, even offered a £lo,ooo bounty for information\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s location. A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read:\n“WANTED: The Sun is offering a £lo,ooo reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal\nGhislaine Maxwell.”'° And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media\nreports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid\nquestioning by the FBI.'’ She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in\nthe bushes. Indeed, since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o, her counsel has been flooded\nwith hundreds of media inquiries and solicitations from members of the public.\n\nThe “open season” declared on Ms. Maxwell after Epstein’s death has come with an\neven darker cost — she has been the target of alarming physical threats, even death threats, and\nhas had to hire security guards to ensure her safety. The media feeding frenzy, which has only\nintensified in recent months, has also deeply affected her family and friends. Some of Ms.\nMaxwell’s closest friends who had nothing whatsoever to do with Epstein have lost their jobs or\n\"© See htps:/Avww.the-sun.com/news/74ol8/the-sun-is-offering-a-loooo-reward-for-information-on-jeffrey-epstein-\npal-ghislaine-maxwell/.\n\n\" See, e.g., htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/ article-8444l37/Jeffrey-Epsteins-fugitive-madam-Ghislaine-\nMaxwell-hiding-luxury-Paris.html.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool599", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l3 of l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

These\nindividuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who\nhave been permited to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.\n\nThe presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest\nin details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that\nwould be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed. See id.

These\nindividuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who\nhave been permited to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.\n\nThe presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest\nin details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that\nwould be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nYour Honor:\nThis statement is in support of Guislaine Maxwell's request for bail and her character.\nee\nI have maintained a\nfairly close relationship with the entire family for most of my life. I not only got to knou the senior\nMaxwells but also got to knou very well their children including Ghislaine, since my age of l5.\nThough I was spending more of my time with the older siblings ee | also\nchose deliberately to spend time with Ian, Kevin and Ghislaine, who were soon going to prep school\ntogether during term-time. You need to knou that their father was narcissistic, highly controlling and\ndemanding as a father, and let them knou early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity.\nSo all the kids knew they had to “make it on their oun” despite the wealth and privilege in which they\nwere grouing up.\nAs I got to knou each of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one\nworked very hard at their jobs, as neither parent, Bob nor Bety. would easily bear any idleness, and\neach strove for their father's and mother's respect through that their intelligence and that hard work. So\nit didn't surprise me that in her prep school classes, as well as her bachelor's and master's work at\nOxford, where she'd folloued her elder siblings, Ghislaine produced exemplary grades and a reputation\nas a serious student. I also noticed that personally, Ghislaine was quick-wited, full of initiative and\ngood humor, sincerely caring touards everyone she knew.\nI've maintained a fairly close relationship with the entire Maxwell clan for most of my life. I didn't\ncontinue to visit them regularly in England, but I stayed in touch by phone, especially with Philip,\nIsabel, Bety and Christine from l962 through the present. I spent time with Bety, Mrs Maxwell, as\nshe needed support, having suddenly been left after the death of Robert Maxwell. Later on, I wrote a\nbook explaining my gratitude to Bety for all she'd taught me about goodness and maturity. When she\nwas finally on her deathbed with Parkinson's in 2ol3, I was glad Isabel, who was caring for her, read\nher my book.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-ll Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3 of 3\nSo I am in a position to speak to Guislaine's character. | had goten to knou her vital personality quite\nwell when she was young. And even though | wasn't in direct touch with her later on, all these Maxwell\nchildren are quite “tight” - they've always stayed closely in touch with each other. Thus whenever I'd\nspeak to any of her elders — Philip, Anne, Isabel and Christine, I'd also hear reports not just about their\noun lives and activities, but also Kevin's and Ian's, as well about Ghislaine's life. Her siblings\nconsistently reported for about a decade that she was enjoying life while starting her oun charity.\nSo what kind of a character is Ghislaine? I can testify without the least doubt that she is mature,\nsensitive, thoughtful, honest and, like all her siblings, strong-willed, determined and quite obviously\ngrounded in good human values. She does not lie. She is no “chicken” - it would be totally unlike her\nto run away from the charges leveled against her by the Government. In fact, the idea of not “facing the\nmusic” is totally against the values of every single Maxwell, because both their parents always\nemphasized personal responsibility — specifically to face Bob's temper. These people consider running\naway their greatest shame. Furthermore, in facing their father's criticisms, they were trained, over and\nover, to defend themselves with real courage. So I have no doubt that not only did Ghislaine — despite\nthe blaring headlines in the press and the governments’ oun opposition to bail alleging incorrectly that\nshe is a “flight risk” — made absolutely no atempt to leave the US at any time in 2ol9, but has stayed\nto fight the civil accusations against her starting earlier. Nor do I have any doubt whatsoever that she\nfully intends to defend herself to the limit of her energy based upon her actual innocence and that above\nall she wants to go to trial and she is categorically not a flight risk.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-24 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of 2\nThe Honourable Alison ] Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NYlooo7\nDear Your Honour,\n2™ November 2o2o\n| am sending this character reference in the knouledge that it will be presented to the court at\nGhislaine’s bail hearing.

Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l77", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo-l Filed l2/l8/2o Page l of 2\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\nes FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l98", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002199.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo-l Filed l2/l8/2o Page 2 of 2\nimportant to her than being connected.

Prejudice Resulting from Prejudicial Media Reporting and Inappropriate\nPre-Trial Publicity.\n\nBeginning in 2oo5 and escalating in 2oll through the present, Ms. Maxwell has been a\npotential target of a group of personal injury lawyers who made millions of dollars suing Jeffrey\nEpstein or extorting those associated with him. The playbook was relatively simple: File\nincendiary pleadings in court to avoid defamation claims; provide the pleadings and background\ninformation to various media organizations; obtain alleged victim’s names and police reports\nfrom law enforcement; share information with potential claimants who hire the lawyers after\nreading or hearing the reports; file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein; get money from Mr. Epstein or\nassociates to setle; repeat. Once Mr. Epstein had setled all of these claims against himself and\nthe other individuals alleged to have been involved, a new play was necessary - try to invalidate\nthe NPA; and at the same time drum up litigation against Maxwell with the expectation that\neither Mr. Epstein would setle any new litigation to avoid being dragged into yet another case\nthat would further tarnish the reputation he was trying to rebuild or result in money directly from\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nFrom 2oll to 2ol9, Ms. Maxwell was the subject of millions of media stories, posts,\nblogs, podcasts, and comments that simply republished the same allegations that she correctly\nidentified as “obvious lies” in 2ol5. Once New York passed L. 2ol9, ch. ll, knoun as the <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nVictims Act, the door was open to claimants who wanted to take advantage of Mr. Epstein’s\nvulnerability to file new lawsuits on stale allegations. At that point it easy to make copycat\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2522", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002650.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are time-barred even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 amendment to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 amendment to apply\nretroactively. To the contrary, the conference commitee considered and rejected an express\nretroactivity provision in the House version of the bill, and one of the bill’s original Senate co-\nsponsors acknouledged on the Senate floor that the omission was intentional. Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive application would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an exception to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.

Because none of the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell has been charged\nnecessarily entails or requires the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, § 3283 does\nnot apply here.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\n\nCounts One through Four of the indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell violated and\nconspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 242l-2424. These\ncounts are based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997.\n\nCount One of the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell violated l8 U.S.C. § 2422 (nou\n§ 2422(a))' by conspiring to entice “one or more individuals” to travel in interstate and foreign\ncommerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” Indictment {fj 9-lo. Count Two charges Ms. Maxwell with a substantive § 2422(a)\nviolation, claiming she “persuaded, induced, enticed, and coerced” an individual identified as\nMinor Victim-l to travel from Florida to New York “with the intention that Minor Victim-l\nwould engage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law,\nSection l3o.55.” Jd. ¥ l3.\n\nCount Three alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to transport “an individual” in interstate\nand foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Indictment §] l5-l6. Count Four charges\nMs. Maxwell with a substantive § 2423(a) violation, claiming she “arranged for Minor Victim-l\nto be transported from Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention\n' Prior to February 8, l996, the provision at issue constituted the entirety of § 2422; it became § 2422(a) as a result\nof the enactment of additional subsections as of that date. Telecommunications Act of l996, PL lo4-lo4, Feb. 8,\nl996, Title V, § 5o8, llo Stat. 56. Thus, the provision is referred to herein as § 2422(a).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2656", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002657.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 25\nthat Minor Victim-l would engage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of\nNew York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Id. § l9.\nARGUMENT\n\n“Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,” a non-capital criminal offense must be\n\ncharged “within five years next after such offense shall have been commited.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3282(a); see l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (l994) (same). Because Counts One through Four charge Ms.\nMaxwell with offenses that were completed no later than l997, and because the indictment was\nnot returned until July 2o2o, these counts are time-barred unless “otherwise expressly provided\nby law.” Id.\n\nFor two independent reasons, § 3283, on which the government relies (see Government’s\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (““Gov. Mem.”), Dkt. No. 4, (filed Jul. 2, 2o2o), at 5),\ndoes not save Counts One through Four. First, under the version of § 3283 that was in effect at\nthe time of the alleged offenses, the limitations period expired when the accuser reached the age\nof 25, which indisputably occurred many years ago here. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While\nCongress amended the statute in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period to “during the life of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,” see Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of\n2oo3 (PROTECT Act) (the “2oo3 Amendment”), PL lo8-2l, April 3o, 2oo3, § 2o2, ll7 Stat.\n65o, 66o, that amendment cannot apply to conduct that occurred during the l99os. Second, by\nits plain terms, § 3283 applies only to offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. But the sexual or physical abuse or kidnaping of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is not an element of any of the offenses charged here. Accordingly, § 3283—regardless of\nwhich version is considered—simply does not apply.\n\nI. The 2oo3 Amendment Does Not Apply Retroactively.\nAt the time of the alleged offenses, § 3283 provided as follous:\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2657", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 25\n\nNo statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\n\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years shall\n\npreclude such prosecution before the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> reaches the age of 25 years.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). Thus, if an individual commited an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse of a l6-year-old person on June l, l994, and the victim reached age l7 on July l,\nl994, then the statute of limitations as to that offense would have expired on July l, 2oo2, when\nthe victim reached age 25—-such that an indictment in 2o2o would be time-barred. There is no\ndispute that all three of the accusers here turned 25 long ago, and thus the statute of limitations in\neffect at the time of the offenses has expired.\n\nIn 2oo3, houever, Congress amended the statute and extended the time in which a\nprosecution could be brought to within the life of the victim. See 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.7 l8\nU.S.C. § 3283, as amended in 2oo3, provided as follous:\n\nNo statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\n\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of\n\nl8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). While the government would apply the 2oo3 Amendment retroactively\nto offenses Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited years earlier, nothing in the text suggests\nthat the statute may be applied retroactively.\n\nTo the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed a strong “presumption against\nretroactive legislation” that is “deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prod.,\n5ll USS. 244, 265 (l994) (emphasis added). “[T]he principle that the legal effect of conduct\nshould ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has\ntimeless and universal appeal.” /d. (internal quotation omited). “Retroactivity is not favored in\n° The statute was amended again in 2oo6 to its current version, which further modifies the limitations period to the\nlife of the victim or lo years after the offense, whichever is longer. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Because all three of the\nalleged victims identified in Counts One through Four are alive, the 2oo6 amendment does not affect the analysis\nhere. Moreover, the government relies on the 2oo3 Amendment. Gov. Mem. at 5-6.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2658", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 25\nretroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment; it actually considered and rejected such a\nprovision, signaling its clear intent that the amendment not be retroactive. Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). Here, the\nlegislative history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,\nwhich would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity\nprovision. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. llo4, lo8th Cong. § 2o2 (2oo3) (“The\namendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense commited\nbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section.”). The Senate version contained no\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo266o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 25\nIl. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nEven if the 2oo3 Amendment could be retroactively applied to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct during the l99os, Counts One through Four would still be time-barred for a separate and\nindependent reason: Section 3283 does not apply to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is\ncharged. Section 3283 extends the statute of limitations only for “offense[s] involving the sexual\nor physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, but none\nof the offenses charged in Counts One through Four is such an offense.’\n\nA. Section 3283 applies only to offenses that necessarily entail the sexual or\n\nphysical abuse, or kidnapping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nA long line of cases establishes that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain\nconduct means an offense that “necessarily requir[es]” that conduct. Shular v. United States, l4o\nS. Ct. 779, 785 (2o2o) (internal quotations omited). Those cases date back at least to Bridges v.\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which construed the Wartime Suspension of Limitations\nAct’s extension of statutes of limitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud\nagainst the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 3287 (l95o) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held\nthat that extension was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud\nthe United States is an essential ingredient of the offense charged.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 22l.\nThus, the Court held that charges that the defendant knouingly made and conspired to make\nfalse statements in a naturalization proceeding, and that he aided and abeted a fraudulent\ncertificate of naturalization, were subject to the general statute of limitations and not the\nexception, because “fraud is not an essential ingredient” of such offenses, and “[t]he offense is\ncomplete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it.” Jd. at 222.\n\n’ The words “or kidnaping” were added as part of the 2oo3 Amendment. 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 25\nId. Similarly, an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under\nthe age of l8 years” is an offense in which such sexual abuse, physical abuse, or kidnapping is an\nelement of the offense.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit concluded as much in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th\nCir. 2oll). There, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a charge of possession of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\npornography. /d. at 8l7-l8. The court clearly looked to the elements of the statute, as the facts\nof the case did involve the sexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, including the production and possession of\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. /d. at 8l3-l4. Yet the court held that, on the same set of facts, the offense of\npossession of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography did not involve sexual abuse and thus was subject to the general\nstatute of limitations, but the offense of production of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography did involve sexual\nabuse and was subject to § 3283: “That a producer of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography will possess it at the\ntime of the abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\npornography itself does not involve an act against a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, i.e., the sexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” Jd. at\n8l7.\n\nCoutentos demonstrates that the “offense involving” language of § 3283, as with other\nstatutes, requires the court to look to the elements of the offense, rather than the facts of a\nparticular case, to determine whether a particular offense “involves” the sexual or physical abuse\nor kidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. /d. at 8l7. This approach makes practical sense: If the applicability of\n§ 3283 depended on the facts of a particular case, rather than the elements of the offense, the\ngovernment would effectively be required to prove conduct beyond the elements of the\noffense—i.e., that sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping occurred—in order to prove that its\ncharges are not time-barred.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2668", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 25\n\nSuch a “necessarily entails” or “elements of the offense” approach is particularly\nappropriate for three additional reasons here. First, like the Wartime Suspension Act in Bridges,\n§ 3283 creates an “exception” to the general five-year limitations period of § 3282, and such\nexceptions should be “narrouly construed.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-l6 (citing United States v.\nMcElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639 (l926)); see also Comm ’r v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (l989) (“we\nusually read the exception narrouly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision,”\nparticularly when the exception is “somewhat ambiguous”). Second, § 3282 itself requires that\nany exception to the five-year rule be “expressly provided by law.” l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (emphasis\nadded). Nouhere does § 3283 “expressly” purport to cover offenses that could (but need not) be\nproved by facts involving sexual or physical abuse of a minor. And third, under the rule of\nlenity, ambiguity with respect to criminal statutes should be construed in favor of the defendant.\nBurrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4); see also United States v. Valle, 8o7 F.3d\n5o8, 523 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“where, as here, the Government and the defense both posit plausible\ninterpretations of a criminal statute, the rule of lenity requires us to adopt the defendant’s\nconstruction”). To do otherwise would violate the “longstanding congressional ‘policy of\nrepose’ that is fundamental to our society and our criminal law.” See Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-\nl6; see also Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (‘criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose” (internal quotation omited)).*\n\nB. The offenses charged in Counts One through Four do not necessarily entail\n\nthe sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nUnder the “necessarily entails” approach, § 3283 does not apply: None of the charged\ncounts “necessarily” entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” See l8\n® Nor has the Second Circuit held otherwise. In Weingarten, because the issue arose in the context of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, the court concluded only that it was “not obvious” that § 3283 required an elements-\nbased approach. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 53, 58-59.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2669", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 22 of 25\nU.S.C. § 3283. Counts One and Two arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), which, at the time of the\nalleged conduct, provided that a person could be charged with a criminal offense if she\n“knouingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to travel in interstate or\nforeign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, to engage in\nprostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996) (emphasis added). That statute criminalizes enticing\n“individual[s],” not necessarily children, to cross state lines to engage in sexual activities. In\nother words, the act that violates § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail the enticement of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nto travel, because the enticement of an individual of any age satisfies the statute.\n\nFurther, § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail “sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283. A substantive § 2422(a) offense is complete when an individual is\n“nersuade[d], induce[d], entice[d], or coerce[d]” to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity,\nand a conspiracy to commit such an offense is complete when an agreement to “persuade[],\ninduce[], entice[], or coerce[]” an individual to engage in such travel is reached and a single\novert act is commited in furtherance of the agreement. It is immaterial to either offense whether\nany unlawful sexual activity subsequently occurs. Moreover, the intended unlawful sexual\nactivity required to establish a § 2422(a) offense need not involve “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping”; § 2422(a) is frequently, if not primarily, invoked in prosecutions involving the\nenticement of adults to travel to engage in prostitution, including on a voluntary basis. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rashkovski, 3ol F.3d ll33, ll35-37 (9th Cir. 2oo2). For all of these reasons,\nCounts One and Two do not charge offenses involving the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and thus are not subject to § 3283.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo267o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 25\n\nNor does § 3283 apply to extend the statutes of limitations under Counts Three and Four.\nThose counts arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), which prohibits “transporting” minors across state\nlines “with intent that the [minor] engage in . . . any sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” (emphasis added).? Neither that offense nor a conspiracy to\n“transport” a minor with such intent necessarily entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Instead, as with § 2422(a), the offense is a “crime of\nintent and a conviction is entirely sustainable even if no underlying criminal sexual act ever\noccurs.” United States v. Broxmeyer, 6l6 F.3d l2o, l29 n.8 (2d Cir. 2olo). For this reason,\nCounts Three and Four are not subject to § 3283’s extended statute of limitations.\n\nIt does not mater that the particular facts alleged in the indictment fall within § 3283.\n“The embellishment of the indictment does not lengthen the time for prosecution.” Bridges, 346\nU.S. at 222. Nor does it mater that sexual abuse of a minor may “often accompan[y]” the\noffenses charged. See id. “[U]nder the statute[s] creating the offense[s],” physical or sexual\nabuse of a minor, or kidnapping, is not “an essential ingredient.” /d. Thus, § 3283’s extension\nfor “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of\nl8 years” does not apply.\n° l8 U.S.C. § 2423 was amended effective September l3, l994, to add a subsection (b) and make cosmetic\nadjustments, immaterial here, to what is nou subsection (a). Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of\nl994, PL lo3-322, Sept. l3, l994, Title XVI, § l6oool(g), lo8 Stat. l796.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo267l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l6\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years” could be brought\nuntil the victim reached age 25. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While Congress amended the statute\nin 2oo3 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the\nvictim, l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in a. and thus the\nstatute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the amendment. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any\nevent,’ it is black-leter law that retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539\nU.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-\n3.\n\nB. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged\n\nConspiracies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice or cause\none or more individuals to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in unlawful\nsexual activity. Because, as shoun above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to\nallege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even\narguably alleges such a conspiracy are Accuser-l and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding\nAccuser-3, houever, have nothing to do with any conspiracy as to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.\n\nWhile the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as “overt acts”\nin furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not. The “scope of\nthe conspiratorial agreement” is the key to determining whether “an overt act may properly be\nregarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp. 2d 299,\n3ll (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2), aff'd sub nom. United States v.

It is for the jury to decide\nwhether the defendant commited perjury, and the motion should be denied.

Seventh, the Indictment\nindisputably alleges each element of every offense charged and provides the defendant with ample\nnotice of the charges against her. Eighth, the Indictment is properly pled and there is no basis to\nstrike any portion of it as surplusage.

To the extent\nthe defendant seeks discovery under Rule l6, she has failed to meet her burden.

Maxwell contends that Section 3283 should not be applied to conduct\nthat predated its amendment in 2oo3 (Def. Mot. 2), but that argument is contrary to the text of the\nstatute, Congress’s clear intent when extending the statute of limitations, and the decisions of other\ncircuits and district courts in this Circuit. In effect, the defendant’s motion asks this Court to break\nnew ground, and become the first court to hold that Section 3283 applies only prospectively.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2984", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 239\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell argues that Section 3283 is inapplicable because the offenses\ncharged in the Indictment do not “involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse .. . of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” (Def.\nMot. 2 at l2-l4). Yet her argument runs contrary to the weight of authority that has adopted the\ncommon-sense view that crimes that necessarily entail the sexual or physical abuse of children\n“involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” This Court should do the same and deny the\nmotion.\n\nA. Statutory Background\n\nBetween l99o and 2oo6, Congress passed a series of laws that expanded the statute of\nlimitations for prosecutions of crimes against minors, ultimately extending the statute of\nlimitations to the lifetime of the minor victim and, for certain offenses, eliminating the statute of\nlimitations entirely. These laws reflect a virtually unbroken congressional policy that the default\nfive-year statute of limitations for federal crimes, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, is inadequate for such\noffenses. An extended statute of limitations is necessary because “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse offenses . . .\nmay be difficult to detect quickly,” in part because children often first report their abuse long after\nit occurs. Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (citing, e.g., David McCord,\nExpert Psychological Testimony About <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Complainants in Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 77 J.\nCrim. L. & Criminology l, 6o-6l (l986)).\n\nIn l99o, Congress enacted a new statute of limitation for certain crimes against children,\nwhich stated: “No statute of limitation that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years shall preclude such a\nprosecution before the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> reaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control Act of l99o, Pub. L. No.\nlol-647, tit. II, § 225(a), lo4 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k) (l99o)). In l994,\nCongress re-codified this provision, moving it to l8 U.S.C. § 3283 with identical language.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2985", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 52 of 239\nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of l994, Pub.

Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3)). Accordingly, in April 2oo3, Congress\namended Section 3283 to permit the prosecution of sex offenses against minors at any time during\nthe lifetime of the minor victim. Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of\nChildren Today Act (“PROTECT Act”) of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, tit. II, § 2o2, ll7 Stat. 65o,\n66o (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3)) (“No statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under\nthe age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.”).\n\nIn January 2oo6, Congress further amended Section 3283 to its current form to permit the\nprosecution of such offenses during the lifetime of the victim or ten years after the offense,\nwhichever is longer. Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of\n2oo6, Pub. L. No. lo9-l62, tit.

L. No. lo9-248, l2o Stat. 587. That statute\neliminated the statute of limitations entirely for certain crimes involving the sexual exploitation of\nminors. /d. tit. I], § 2ll(l), l2o Stat. at 6l6 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 3299).\n\nB. The 2oo3 Amendment to Section 3283 Applies Retroactively\n\nCounts One through Four of the Indictment charge crimes that occurred between l994\nand l997. At the time of the offense conduct, the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3283 (l994), ran until “the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> reaches the age of 25.” Houever, in 2oo3, while the statute of\nlimitations had not yet run for the crimes charged in the Indictment,!? Congress amended the\nstatute, extending the limitations period to permit a prosecution at any time “during the life of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). Because the victims are all alive, the Indictment is timely under\nthe 2oo3 amendment.\n\nPut simply, the 2oo3 amendment applies to any conduct that could have been charged at\nthe time of its enactment. The legislative purpose behind Section 3283 and a plain reading of the\nstatute compel this conclusion, and courts have repeatedly held that the 2oo3 amendment applies\nretroactively, provided that the statute of limitations had not run for the offense at the time of the\namendment. See, e.g., United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Because Congress evinced a clear intent to extend, rather than shorten, the statute of limitations\napplicable to sexual abuse crimes, and because there is no ex post facto problem here, the\nprosecution was timely.”) (citing United States v.

June 7, 2olo) (holding that the 2oo3 amendment of Section 3283 applies to pre-\nenactment conduct, and rejecting the argument “that the lack of a savings clause in the 2oo3\nversion of section 3283 is fatal to extending the statute of limitations.”); United State v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 624-3o (E.D. Va. 2ol9) (holding that the 2oo3 amendment of Section 3283\napplies to pre-enactment conduct).\n\nIn Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244 (l994), the Supreme Court set forth a\ntwo-part framework for determining whether a statute applies retroactively. At step one of the\nanalysis, “if Congress ‘expressly prescribed’ that a statute applies retroactively to antecedent\nconduct, ‘the inquiry ends[] and the court enforces the statute as it is writen,’ save for\nconstitutional concerns.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55 (quoting Jn re Enter. Mort. Acceptance\nCo. Sec. Litig. (“Enterprise”), 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o5-o6 (2d Cir. 2oo4)).

For the reasons set forth belou, the 2oo3 amendment of\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 satisfies both steps of Landgraf, and should be applied to pre-enactment conduct.\n\nl. The 2oo3 Amendment Satisfies Step One of Landgraf\n\nAt step one of the Landgraf analysis, the question is whether Congress has “expressly\nprescribed the statute’s proper reach.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. When evaluating Congress’s\nintent at step one of the Landgraf inquiry, the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the legislative history. Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o6-o8. In this case, the amended\nversions of Section 3283 evince Congress’s express intent to extend the statute of limitations. The\ntext and history of Section 3283 firmly establish that, with each amendment of the statute of\nlimitations, Congress intended to repeal and replace the prior version of the statute and thereby\nextend the time to bring live charges of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse.\n\nThe 2oo3 amendment, like the l994 version of the statute, specifically states that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution of such offense during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3).\nClaims that were live in 2oo3 were, at the time, subject to the then-existing statute of limitations,\nwhich ran until the victims reached the age of 25. Whenever that statute of limitations ran, it would\n“otherwise preclude prosecution.” Instead, that statute of limitations was replaced by the 2oo3\namendment.\n\nThe Eighth and Ninth Circuits have both held that Congress intended to extend the statute\nof limitations for live claims of sexual abuse. In United States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682 (8™ Cir.\n2oo5), the Eighth Circuit reasoned that “both the title and wording of § 35o9(k) indicate that\nCongress intended by it to extend the general statute of limitations. . . . § 35o9(k) was later\nrecodified at § 3283 and continued to extend the statute of limitations in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse cases.” Jd. at\n684 (citing United States v. Johns, l5 F.3d 74o, 743 (8th Cir. l994) (holding that an earlier version\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2989", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 239\nof § 35o9(k) applied to conduct predating its enactment in l99o)). The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse, but the legislative history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> could not be prosecuted\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\nidentified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express intention was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 amendment extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Broun, 8oo F. App’x 455, 46l (9th Cir. 2o2o) (2ol4 indictment charging,\namong other crimes, sex trafficking offenses dating to 2ooo and 2ool), cert. denied, No. 2o-5o64,\n-- 8. Ct. -- , 2o2l WL 78235 (Jan. ll, 2o2l); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM),\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo299o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 239\nthe resurrection of time-barred prosecutions, in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.'4 But that\nconcern is entirely separate from extending the statute of limitations for live claims, which is what\nCongress did here. Critically—and as discussed in greater detail belou—there is no Ex Post Facto\nClause issue in this case, because the statute of limitations for Counts One through Four had not\nyet expired when the limitations period was extended in 2oo3.\"\n\nAccepting the defendant’s argument would undermine Congress’s plain purpose in\nextending the limitations period. In l99o, 2oo3, and 2oo6, Congress extended—and ultimately\nabolished—the statute of limitations to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex\nabuse victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay. Applying the 2oo3 statute\nonly prospectively subverts that purpose by exempting all past offenders. According to the\n‘4 Moreover, the fact that Congress considered, but ultimately omited, retroactivity language does\nnot end the Landgraf inquiry, as the defendant suggests. Indeed, Landgraf itself makes this clear.\nIn that case, the statute at issue had a predecessor, which contained a retroactivity provision. That\nversion was vetoed by the President, and the final version of the statute omited the retroactivity\nprovision. As the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he omission of the elaborate retroactivity\nprovision of the l99o bill—which was by no means the only source of political controversy over\nthat legislation—is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was\nstruck in the l99l Act.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256. Indeed, “[i]t [was] entirely possible—indeed,\nhighly probable—that, because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of\nthe l99o legislation, Congress viewed the mater as an open issue to be resolved by the courts.”\nTd. at 26l.\n\n'S Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 were both younger than 25 in 2oo3, when Congress\nextended the limitations period. Minor Victim-3 was not, but this does not alter the inquiry,\nbecause the Indictment does not contain any counts that relate to Minor Victim-3 alone. Instead,\nshe is one of multiple victims of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. The inclusion\nof the overt acts relating to Minor Victim-3 in an otherwise timely conspiracy count does not\nrender that count untimely. To the contrary, for conspiracy counts, the Government is only\nrequired to prove that one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred within the limitations\nperiod. United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2ool). Thus, the defendant is incorrect\nto assert that the government is “barred” from prosecuting the defendant for any offense against\nMinor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 2 at lo, n.3). Instead, there is no statute of limitations issue here so\nlong as the jury is properly instructed at trial that it must find at least one overt act within the\nlimitations period—i.e., one overt act that does not relate to Minor Victim-3.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2992", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002997.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 239\nToussie to the Landgraf analysis, see United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7), and that case, which did not concern Section 3283, relied extensively on a pre-Landgraf\nopinion requiring a clear statement of congressional intent in favor of retroactivity. See id. at 655\n(citing United States v. Richardson, 5l2 F.2d lo5 (3d Cir. l975)). That clear-statement rule is\ninconsistent with the analysis required by Landgraf step two. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l\n(rejecting an identical argument relying on Toussie and Gentile).\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to break new ground and become the first court to hold that\nSection 3283 applies only prospectively. The Court should reject this invitation. For the reasons\nset forth above, the weight of authority holds that Section 3283 applies retroactively, in keeping\nwith Congress’s express intent to expand prosecutions of individuals who sexually exploit\nchildren. The Indictment is timely, and the motion should be denied.\n\nC. The Defendant’s Crimes Involved the Sexual Abuse of Minors\n\nThe defendant next argues that Section 3283 does not apply at all, and she asks the Court\nto conclude that the crimes of sexual abuse alleged in the Indictment did not involve sexual abuse.\nHer argument runs contrary to both the case law and common sense. Her motion is meritless and\nshould be denied.\n\nBy its terms, Section 3283 applies to any “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse,\nor kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. As discussed above, when\nthe statute was first enacted, it was located at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k). The definition of the term\n“sexual abuse” is located in a neighboring provision within that same section:\n\nFor purposes of this section . . . the term ‘sexual abuse’ includes the\nemployment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2997", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 239\n\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form\n\nof sexual exploitation of children, or incest with children.\nl8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). The term “sexually explicit conduct” is in turn defined to mean, among\nother things, “sexual intercourse, including sexual contact”; and the term “sexual contact” means\n“the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast,\ninner thigh, or butocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse\nor gratify sexual desire of any person.” Jd. § 35o9(a)(9)(A). Courts have looked to the definition\nof “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a) to determine whether the statute of limitations of\nSection 3283 applies to an offense. United States v.

May 8, 2ol4) (applying the definition of “sexual abuse” set forth in\nSection 35o9(a)).\n\nAs is evident from its plain text, the definition of “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a)\nincludes not only actual “sexual contact,” but also the “the employment, use, persuasion,\ninducement, enticement, or coercion of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to engage in, or assist another person to engage in,”\nsexual contact. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a). The breadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s\nuse of the word “includes.” The Supreme Court has held that Congress’s choice of the word\n“includes” is “significant because it “makes clear that the examples enumerated in the text are\nintended to be illustrative, not exhaustive.” Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S.\nl42, l62 (2ol2) (citing Burgess v. United States, 552 U.S. l24, l3l n.3 (2oo8)). Thus, sexual\nabuse “as defined here encompasses a wider set of behavior than just rape or other unwanted sexual\ntouching.” United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86, l97 (3d Cir. 2ol5). In keeping with that\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2998", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 239\nbroad definition, courts have held that Section 3283 “does not require that an offense consist of a\nsexual act between a defendant and a specific <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,” Vickers, 2ol4 WL l838255, at *ll, but\ninstead reaches offenses involving the transportation of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity.\nSee Sensi, 2olo WL 235l484, at *2-3 (collecting cases interpreting the term “sexual abuse” to\nencompass “all crimes that would logically relate to the common understanding of sexual abuse\neven when found in chapters llo (‘Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and ll7\n(‘Transportation of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related Crimes’) of title l8”); Schneider, 8ol F.3d\nat l96-97 (holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant convicted of traveling with the purpose\nof engaging in sex with a minor victim, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b)); Vickers, 2ol4 WL\nl838255, at *ll-l2 (holding that violations of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) were crimes involving sexual\nabuse under Section 3283).\n\nThe defendant’s motion does not engage with these authorities at all. Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\nSuspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4). But Bridges is inapposite,\nsince it concerned a statute “[t]he legislative history of [which] emphasize[d] the propriety of its\nconservative interpretation” and “indicate[d] a purpose to suspend the general statute of limitations\nonly as to” certain narrouly defined offenses. Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l6. There is no corresponding\nindication that Congress intended the “essential ingredients” test to apply to Section 3283. As the\nThird Circuit has explained in rejecting an identical argument:\n\nWhile Bridges did adopt an “essential ingredient” test, the\nlimitations-extending statute at issue was a narrouly drafted\nexception specifically intended to target frauds related to war\nprocurement. Unlike the WSLA, § 3283 has no such restrictive\nlanguage or legislative history suggesting congressional intent to\nlimit its application to a specific subset of circumstances.

United States, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. Rejecting the claim, the Second Circuit observed that none of the\ncriteria for applying the categorical approach are met in the context of Section 3283. Jd. The\ncategorical approach—which focuses on the elements of the offense—is generally only used in\nsetings like sentencing and immigration, where a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a\nprior conviction. /d. at 59. In such a context, a court atempting to examine the facts of the prior\nconviction to determine the present punishment or immigration consequences would encounter\nlogistical and constitutional obstacles. /d. (noting an Apprendi problem and “daunting practical\ndifficulties and potential unfairness”). None of those concerns is present here, where the relevant\nfacts will be proved at trial.\n\nThe Weingarten court also specifically rejected the argument Maxwell nou asserts: that\nthe words “offense involving” require a categorical approach. “[T]hat Congress used the word\n‘involving’ in § 3283 does not necessarily mean it intended to trigger the categorical approach.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ooo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003001.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6/7 of 239\n‘Involving’ .. . is equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” 865 F.3d at 6o n.ll\n(citing Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 38 (2oo9) (applying the circumstances-specific approach\nto a statute containing the word “involves”)). Moreover, as the Weingarten court observed, the\nSupreme Court has applied the categorical approach to statutes containing the word “involving”\nwhere the statutes at issue also referenced “elements” of offenses, or specific prior “convictions,”\nin a manner that referred to specific convictions, as opposed to particular offense conduct. 865\nF.3d at 59 (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (l99o); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l\n(2oo4)). By contrast, the phrase “sexual abuse” in Section 3283 refers to specific conduct, and not\nthe statutory offenses charged in the Indictment.\n\nIn Weingarten, the Second Circuit further noted that applying the categorical approach to\nSection 3283 would run contrary to Congress’s intention to “cast a wide net to ensnare as many\noffenses against children as possible.” 865 F.3d at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96). On\nthis point, it bears emphasizing that the interpretation the defendant advances would lead to absurd\noutcomes, as many federal crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors do not contain, as an\nelement, a requirement that the defendant commit a sex act with a minor. It would run contrary to\nCongress’s intent to interpret Section 3283 in a manner that would exclude many—if not most—\nsexual offenses against children.\n\nThe lone Section 3283 case the defendant cites, United States v. Countentos, 65l F.3d 8o9\n(8th Cir. 2oll), is easily distinguishable on its facts. In that case, the Eighth Circuit considered,\namong other issues, whether the crime of possessing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography involved sexual abuse\nwithin the meaning of Section 3283. /d. at 8l6-l8. In analyzing that question, the court discussed,\namong a variety of factors, the elements of the crime. But it did not consider the categorical\napproach, or purport to apply an “essential ingredients” test, as the defendant implies. Instead, the\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003002.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 239\ncourt resolved the issue by answering a common sense question: “Does someone who merely\npossesses <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography sexually abuse the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> portrayed in the images?” /d. at 8l7. This\ninquiry has no relevance here, as this case does not involve the possession of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography.\n\nThe crimes charged in the Indictment plainly involved the sexual abuse of minors. First,\nthe Indictment clearly alleges that the minor victims were subjected to actual, physical sexual\ncontact as part of the defendant’s crimes. See Indictment at {{ 4 (alleging that conduct touard\nminor victims involved sexual abuse), 5 (alleging that “Epstein’s resulting abuse of minor victims\nincluded, among other things, touching a victim’s breast, touching a victim’s genitals, placing a\nsex toy such as a vibrator on a victim’s genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he\nmasturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein’s genitals.”), 7 (describing paterns of sexual\nabuse). Moreover, the Indictment alleges that the defendant persuaded, induced, enticed, and\ntransported minors for purposes of engaging in criminal sexual activity, and that she conspired to\ndo the same. As discussed above, the offenses charged in the Indictment accordingly involved the\nsexual abuse of minors as defined in Section 35o9(a) and incorporated into Section 3283.\n\nBecause the defendant’s crimes involved sexual abuse, the expanded statute of limitations\nset forth in Section 3283 applies to the crimes charged in Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment and her motion should be denied.\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment Based on Alleged Improper Pre-\n\nTrial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Indictment should be dismissed because the Government’s\ndelay in bringing the charges violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. (Def. Mot.\n7). The defendant has not and cannot successfully establish such a violation. First, the defendant\nhas not established that any alleged pre-indictment delay caused actual prejudice to the defense.\nHer speculative assertions about lost witnesses and records are hardly the sort of evidence that she\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3oo2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 239\nchoices reflected in the criminal discovery rules.” Jd. Second, doing so “risks invading ‘the\ninviolable function of the jury’ in our criminal justice system.’” /d. at 28l (citation omited).\nAccordingly, if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined with a\ndefendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” Jd.\n\nThe exception to this rule is “extraordinarily narrou” because, in the normal course, the\n“government must make a detailed presentation of the entirety of the evidence before a district\ncourt can dismiss an indictment on sufficiency grounds,” which the Government is not required to\ndo at the motion-to-dismiss stage. /d. at 282 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). That\npoint is underscored by United States v. Nitsche, 843 F. Supp. 2d 4 (D.D.C. 2oll), on which the\ndefendant relies. There, the district court dismissed an indictment in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> enticement case for\ninsufficiency of the evidence. First, houever, the court explained that the question was ripe\nbecause “(l) Defendant has stipulated to the entire record that is relevant to Count I; (2) the\nGovernment has had several opportunities to make a proffer of any additional facts, to conduct\nany subsequent investigation, and to ask the Court for further delay to seek more evidence; and (3)\nbecause the record is limited to the chat.” Jd. at 9. Accordingly, “[t]he transcripts themselves\nprovide the Court with all of the relevant undisputed facts to decide the motion.” /d. Here, of\ncourse, that is simply not the case and, in particular, there is no stipulation as to the entire relevant\nrecord.\n\nUnder the relevant legal standard, the defendant’s statements were material if they could\nhave led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the factfinder in the defendant’s\ncivil case. Evaluating that standard necessarily implicates facts beyond the deposition testimony\nitself and Judge Preska’s unsealing order,*’ such as identification of the allegedly defamatory\n°° The defendant observes that Judge Preska redacted some of the statements that form the basis\nof Count Six, stating that the “testimony is . . . far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of\nthe civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a\npseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider\nGiuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\nconviction); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting instruction to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 239\nasserts that the crimes charged in Counts One through Four require additional specificity without\nciting any authority in support of such a broad claim. (See Def. Mot. l2 at 2). In particular, the\ndefendant suggests that the failure to identify each minor victim by name, the presence of a date\nrange rather than specific dates, and the use of certain language that the defendant claims not to\nunderstand render Counts One through Four so deficient that they must be dismissed. Because the\ndefendant cites no authority indicating that violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 37l, 2422, or 2423 fall into\nthe rare exception to “the rule that ‘an indictment need do litle more than to track the language of\nthe statute charged,’” her motion should be denied. United States v. Murgio, 2o9 F. Supp. 3d 698,\n7l6 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (Nathan, J.) (quoting Stringer, 73o F.3d at l24).\n\nFirst, the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged conduct does not\nwarrant dismissal of the Indictment. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l24 (affirming sufficiency of fraud\nindictment “[n]Jotwithstanding its failure to specify the names of persons whose identifying\ndocuments were used” in scheme where prosecution provided victims’ names in advance of trial).\nThe identity of a victim is not required to be included on the face of a charging instrument, and the\n“lack of any identity or date of birth information of the alleged victims does not warrant dismissal”\nof charges alleging sexual abuse. United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp.3d 364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9).\nThe defendant cites no law to the contrary and has not identified a single indictment in this District\nthat includes the full names of minor victims of sexual abuse. Indeed, it makes good sense that a\ncharging instrument alleging sexual abuse of minors would not include the full names of minor\nvictims, whose privacy Congress has emphasized should be protected. See l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)\n(delineating privacy protections for <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims and witnesses).\n\nJudge Marrero’s decision in Kidd, which denied a motion to dismiss a sex trafficking\ncharges in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l where the indictment referred to victims by pseudonyms,\nl53\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003116.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l82 of 239\nl838255, at *l, 4-6 (W.D.N.Y.

Indeed, “[b]Jecause minors often are not capable of\nremembering the exact dates when the alleged acts occurred, ‘fairly large time windous in the\ncontext of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse prosecutions are not in conflict with constitutional notice requirements.’”\nYoung, 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (quoting Valentine v. Konteh, 395 F.3d 626, 632 (6th Cir. 2oo5)).\nThe same is true here. The minor victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the\nexact dates when particular instances of abuse took place during their adolescence. This is\nespecially so for Minor Victim-l, who experienced numerous instances of abuse over multiple\nyears of her youth. Providing the approximate ranges of dates during which the offenses took\nplace fully satisfies the requirements of an adequately pled charging instrument. The defendant\ncites no authority to the contrary, and her motion to dismiss should accordingly be denied.\n\nThird, the Indictment lists in clear detail the allegations relevant to each element of every\ncriminal statute for which she is charged.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 348\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher. Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafaia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 42 of 348\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.’\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 57 of 348\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.’ Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.8 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\nae Dershouitz had jomed Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 348\nOn that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than... everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\n\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can rightly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”~\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office. With\nrespect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say\nthat disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the\nforgoten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified\nas a lapse in judgment.

If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”°\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation often possessed <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3248", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 73 of 348\nequipment.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003255.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 348\nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\nZ Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalm Beach County State Atorney’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, in violation of FI.

The\n\ncontemporaneous emails shou that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered\nmultiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the\nstate plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear\nthat as the negotiations intensified in September 2oo7, the prosecutors became increasingly\nfrustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and\nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.\nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3255", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls.

FEBRUARY — JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'® Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 348\n\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes, 78\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last! Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.’ The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA| applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement personnel shall ensure” that victims\nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the\nvictim[.]” Fla.

Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed”’ On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”?*\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo343o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out ina leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised.\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 289 of 348\nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*!?\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The 2oo3 Amendment expands the statute of limitations\nfor an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.

While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary. Consideration of such authority compels application of § 3283 by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue, and even under the definition of “sexual abuse” the\ngovernment proposes, none of the elements of either § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) constitutes sexual\nabuse.\n\nl, The 2oo3 Amendment Does Not Apply Retroactively.\n\nThe government does not dispute that Landgraf is the appropriate framework for\ndetermining whether a statute applies retroactively. Opp. 27. Under Landgraf, the first step is\n“to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach”; if it has,\nthere is no need to proceed further. 55l U.S. at 28o. Ifit has not, the court must determine\n“whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a\nparty possessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties\nwith respect to transactions already completed.” Jd.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3659", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9of22\n\nthat Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,’\nCongress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision\naltogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 22\nthus did not decide the issue (and in which Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nnot discussed), and Nader, in which the court incorrectly excluded legislative history from its\nLandgraf analysis. If Landgraf is correctly applied, and legislative history is given its proper\nweight in the analysis, it is clear from Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision that it did\nnot intend the 2oo3 Amendment to be retroactive. Counts One through Four are therefore time-\nbarred.\n\n3. The government cannot prevail at step one.\n\nMeanwhile, the government’s claim that it should prevail at step one can be easily\ndispensed with. The government relies on the language in the 2oo3 Amendment that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). While the\ngovernment argues that this language refers to the pre-amendment version of § 3283, the Second\nCircuit recognized in Weingarten that “there is a more natural interpretation of that phrase that\ndoes not address retroactivity—that Congress intended the language in the 2oo3 version of\n§ 3283 to clarify that the statute prescribes a statute of limitations for applicable offenses that is\ndifferent from the default five-year limitations period under federal law.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d\nat 55. See also Miller, 9ll F.3d at 644 (suggesting that “otherwise preclude” language “may\nrefer only to preclusion by the five-year federal default statute of limitations”); Nader, 425 F.\nSupp. 3d at 626 (interpreting same language to “merely ‘signal the drafter’s intention that the\nprovisions .. . override conflicting provisions of any other section,’” rather than the pre-\namendment version of § 3283) (quoting Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 5o8 U.S. lo, l8\n(l993)).\n\nThis interpretation is bolstered further by the presence of the same “[n]o statute of\nlimitation[s] that would otherwise preclude” language in the l99o statute that originally created\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3664", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 22\nthe expanded statute of limitations for <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse crimes. See Opp. Mem. 24 (quoting\nCrime Control Act of l99o, Pub. L. No. lol-647, tit. II, § 225(a), lo4 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified\nat l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k) (l99o)). In l99o, “the only existing limitations period to which the\nlanguage could have referred was the [five-year] default limit set forth in [l8 U.S.C. § 3282].”\nMiller, 9ll F.3d at 644. That is the logical reading of the same provision here.\n\nThe government cannot prevail on step one. If step one is not resolved in Ms. Maxwell’s\nfavor, the inquiry must proceed to step two.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s Alleged\n\nOffenses Would Have Impermissible Effects.\n\nEven if the Landgraf inquiry were to proceed to the second step—whether retroactive\napplication would have impermissible effects—Ms. Maxwell should prevail. In arguing\notherwise, the government effectively claims that in the retroactivity context, Landgraf permits\nthe Court to ignore the bedrock principle that “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally\ninterpreted in favor of repose.’” TYoussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting\nUnited States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 5l8, 522 (l932)). But nothing in Landgraf, a civil case,\npurports to limit that principle, let alone abrogate it.\n\nThe government asserts that no court has held that retroactively extending a filing period\nfor live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under Landgraf (Opp. 35),\nbut that is not so. In United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649 (D.N.J. 2ol7), the court held\nthat it would be impermissible to retroactively extend a statute of limitations for live charges\n“absent clear legislative intent” to apply the expanded limitations retroactively. Jd. at 655. In\ndoing so, the court read Landgraf in conjunction not only with Toussie but also with Hughes\nAircraft Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 52o U.S. 939 (l997), a post-Landgraf opinion in which the\nSupreme Court reiterated the law’s presumption against retroactivity and reiterated that “we\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 22\nno dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for\nlive charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.’\nRather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute\nare such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that\nCongress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a conclusion here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 22\noffenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged do not require the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nA. Section 3283 Applies Only to Offenses that Necessarily Entail the Sexual\n\nAbuse or Physical Abuse, or Kidnapping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>.\n\nAs demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly\nand consistently that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense\nthat necessarily entails or requires that conduct. See, e.g., Shular v. United States, l4o S. Ct.\n779, 782 (2o2o) (“a court should look to the state offense’s elements” rather than case-specific\nfacts); United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (rejecting argument that “offense\nthat .. . involves” provision permited court to look to case-specific facts, even if necessary to\nsave provision from unconstitutional vagueness); Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484\n(2ol2) (interpreting “offenses that involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that\nnecessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct”) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4) (stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to\nlook to the elements and the nature of the offense . . rather than to the particular facts” at issue);\nBridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 2l7 n.l5, 22l (l953) (limiting extended statute of\nlimitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud against the United States” to\n“offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud the United States is an essential\ningredient of the offense charged”). The government’s atempt to limit this clear line of cases is\nunpersuasive.\n\nThe government claims that a “necessarily entails” approach (or, as the government\ndescribes it, a “categorical” approach) is “only used in setings like sentencing and immigration,\nwhere a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a prior conviction.” Opp. 39. While one\nwould expect the government to support such a statement with citations to Supreme Court cases\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3668", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 22\noutside the sentencing and immigration context in which the “necessarily entails” approach has\nbeen rejected, it fails to offer any.” Nor does the government respond to the case law cited by\nMs. Maxwell in which courts have interpreted “offense involving” language in a venue statute,\nwhich has nothing to do with sentencing, immigration, or prior convictions, to refer to the\nelements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4)\n(“The most natural reading of § 3237(a) 4 2 is to construe ‘any offense involving’ by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue.”) (emphasis in original); United States v. Ayo, 8ol F. Supp.\n2d l323, l33l (S.D. Ala. 2oll) (“The Eleventh Circuit has employed the second paragraph of\nSection 3237(a) when such transportation, or use of the mails, is an element of the offense\ncharged.”). The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the “necessarily entails”\napproach simply do not exist.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2oo9)—the only\nSupreme Court case the government cites in which the Court applied a fact-based approach to an\n“offense involving” statute—does not break this line of cases at all. In Nijhawan, the statutory\nprovision at issue referred to “an offense that .. . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\nvictim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo.” 557 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § llol(a)(43)(M)(i))\n(emphasis added by Court). The issue before the Court was not whether the statute required\n“fraud or deceit” to be an element of the underlying offense, but whether the referenced\nmonetary threshold was required to be an element. The Court held that it was not, reasoning that\n“Tt]he words ‘in which’ (which modify ‘offense’) can refer to the conduct involved ‘in’ the\n” According to the government, the ostensible rationale for the “necessarily entails” approach—avoiding the need\nfor courts to examine the facts of prior convictions—is not present in the § 3283 context. But a fact-based approach\nposes a different practical obstacle in the statute of limitations context. Under a fact-based approach here, for\nexample, in order to obtain the benefit of the expanded limitations period, the government would be required to\nprove conduct (i.e., sexual abuse) that is not an element of an offense; a jury would be required to find not only that\nMs. Maxwell commited the offenses with which she is charged but also that her offenses “involve[] . . . the sexual\nor physical abuse .. . of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>”; and only after the jury has returned its verdict would it be knoun which statute of\nlimitations—§ 3283 or the default provision under § 3282—applies to this prosecution.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3669", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 22\ncommission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense.” /d. at 39\n(emphasis added by Court). Because § 3283 contains no such modification to the words “offense\ninvolving,” Nijhawan is entirely consistent not only with the Supreme Court cases that interpret\n“offense involving” language as referring to elements of the offense, but also with a similar\ninterpretation of the language as it appears in § 3283.'°\n\nThe Eighth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll),\nsquares perfectly with this approach. In Coutentos, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a\ncharge of possession of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography, even though the facts of the case involved conduct\nthat went beyond the elements of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography and, according to the court, constituted\nsexual abuse. 65l F.3d at 8l7. The government’s atempt to distinguish Coutentos on the\nground that “this case does not involve the possession of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography” (Opp. 4l) misses\nthe point: In determining whether § 3283 applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual\nsexual abuse and instead confined its focus to the elements of the offense of possession of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\npomography. In other words, it used the “necessarily entails” approach. Similarly, § 3283\nrequires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard\nallegations of conduct beyond those elements.\n\nFinally, the government atempts to distinguish Bridges, in which the Supreme Court\nused the equivalent of a “necessarily entails” approach specifically with respect to a statute of\nlimitations, and argues that Bridges is an outlier based on its legislative history. But the\ngovernment fails to identify a single statute of limitations other than § 3283 in which a fact-\n\n° The government cites the Second Circuit’s statement in a footnote in Weingarten that the “offense involving”\n\nlanguage is “equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” Opp. 39-4o (quoting Weingarten, 865 F.3d at\n6o n.ll). Houever, Weingarten relied exclusively on Nijhawan for that proposition; like the government, it cited no\ncase in which a fact-based approach had been used to apply an “offense involving” statute other than § 3283. In any\nevent, the Second Circuit did not hold that a fact-based approach applies to § 3283; it held only, in the context of an\nineffective assistance claim, that it was “not obvious” which approach applies. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo367o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 22\nbased approach has been applied, let alone one that uses “offense involving” language.'’ Given\nthe Supreme Court’s consistent interpretation of such language to require a “necessarily entails,”\nelements-based approach, § 3283 should be similarly interpreted—particularly given the\nobligation under the rule of lenity to construe any ambiguity in criminal statutes in favor of the\ndefendant, Burrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4), and the principle that “criminal\nlimitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(internal quotations and citation omited).\n\nB. The Offenses Charged in Counts One Through Four Do Not Necessarily\n\nEntail the Sexual or Physical Abuse or Kidnapping of a <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>.\n\nThe government appears to argue that even under the “necessarily entails” approach,\n\n§ 3283 applies to the Mann Act offenses at issue here, because § 2422(a) and § 2423(a)\nsomehou necessarily entail the sexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. The government bases this argument on\nits contention that the applicable definition of “sexual abuse” is the definition found at l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35o9(a)(8), because that definition “includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement,\nenticement, or coercion of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of\nchildren, or incest with children.” l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). But even under such an expansive\ndefinition, neither § 2422(a) nor § 2423(a) necessarily entails the sexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nSection 2422(a) does not necessarily entail any act concerning a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, let alone the\n“employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” to engage in any\nsex-related conduct. Rather, § 2422(a) requires only the enticement of an individual—of any\n\" The government also cites United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86 (3d Cir. 2ol5), in which the court rejected the\ndefendant’s comparison of § 3283 to the statute in Bridges. To the extent that the Third Circuit rejected a\n“necessarily entails” approach to § 3283, it appears to have done so without considering the line of Supreme Court\ncases interpreting the “offense involving” language as requiring such an approach—a line that has since expanded to\ninclude Davis and Shular.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo367l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003672.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 22\nage—to travel with the requisite intent. l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a). Section 2423(a) requires only the\ntransportation of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with the requisite intent, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a); it does not necessarily\nentail “the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” to do\nanything other than travel.

If a defendant transports a minor with the intent (unbeknounst to the minor) that\nthe minor will engage in sexual activity, no sexual activity occurs, and there is no “employment,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion” to engage in sexual activity, a § 2423(a)\noffense has been commited, but no sexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> has occurred.\n\nWhile the government cites several cases in which courts have found § 3283 applicable to\nparticular statutes, it cites only one case in which either a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense has\nbeen held to involve “sexual abuse” within the meaning of § 3283. In United States v. Vickers,\nNo. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA) (HKS), 2ol4 WL l838255 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4), the court held that a\n§ 2423(a) offense involved sexual abuse, but it did not hold that § 2423(a) necessarily entails\nsexual abuse; instead, the court used a fact-based approach. /d. at *ll (“defendant Vickers is\ncharged with transportation of a minor in violation of [§ 2423(a)] and it is alleged that the\ndefendant did have sexual contact with Victim I”) (emphasis added). No court has held that\neither the enticement of an individual to travel or the transportation of a minor necessarily entails\n“sexual abuse” within the meaning of § 3283. It does not.

The indictment is timely\n\nA. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations\n\nFederal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. l8\nU.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children,\nCongress has provided a longer limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping” of a minor. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2oo3, the operative version\nof § 3283 alloued prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five.\nCongress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-\n2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, to allou prosecution any time during the life of the victim.\n\nThe parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act,\nbut untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2oo3\nversion of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the\ngeneral statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2oo3 version of § 3283\napplies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2oo3. The Court concludes that statute of\nlimitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely.\n\nl. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors\n\nMaxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the Sl superseding indictment involve\nthe sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the\nalleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for\nthat purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view,\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3683", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003685.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 34\nTo the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is\ninappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that... . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3685", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”’” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3686", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\n\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3688", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “‘inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3689", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003690.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 34\nHouever, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to\nthese charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past\nconduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively\nimpermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or ataches a new disability, in\nrespect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to prosecute her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is ‘the\nprimary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.’” United States v.

Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d\n364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir.\nl987)). “This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse\nof underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses.” United States v.\nYoung, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK), 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8) (collecting\ncases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time,\nand witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when\nabuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct.\n\nMaxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges\nimpermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the\nindictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of\nthe crime. 7ramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The language of the Sl superseding indictment does so.\nThe Government’s decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell’s argument that some of the conduct alleged is\nnot inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government’s case, not the specificity of the\ncharges.\n\nFinally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not\nprovide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged\nvictims’ names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally\nneed not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United\nStates v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l27 (2d Cir. 2ol3); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364,\n369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9).

Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A, 2ol4 WL l838255, at *l (W.D.N.Y. May 8,\n2ol4), also does not help the government. This case concerned a one count indictment in 2ol3. It\nis patently clear from the opinion by the district court that the statements from the alleged victim\ndetailing the allegation had been provided to the defendant and the court which noted that the\nlengthy recitation of facts in the opinion “are taken from the allegations set forth in the Affidavit\nof Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Jennifer Jayne Amo submited in support of the\nMay l6, 2ol3 Criminal Complaint (Dkt.# l), the Indictment (Dkt.# 8), and the government's\nresponse to the instant motions (Dkt.# 2o).” 2ol4 WL l838255, at *3 n.l.

These date ranges are well within the boundaries\npermited by the Second Circuit and other federal courts, and have been supplemented with\nadditional details provided by the Government. Id., at *4 (emphasis added).\n\nTo date, the only time the government has “supplemented” any information about the\naccusations is when it is atempting to excuse some failure.\n\nHere, the accusers have given statements to the government.

This is a\nsituation where the government has refused to provide basic necessary information in an atempt\nto prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s defense.\n\n“Third,” the indictment is not “clear” (Resp. at l55); it was purposely drafted to\nmaximize charges and minimize clarity. For example, the photograph of Ms. Maxwell in the\nindictment is not from the time-period alleged.

For instance, in United States v.

(See Section I supra). The\ngovernment cannot make a contrary shouing. Accordingly, prosecuting Epstein for Counts Five\nand Six would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. And because Epstein negotiated immunity\nfor Ms. Maxwell and any other “potential co-conspirators” as part of the terms of the NPA, Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be prosecuted for those crimes either.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 33 of 349\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 43 of 349\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nWi.

May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 45 of 349\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 52 of 349\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 57 of 349\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 58 of 349\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.’ Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, ““Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.*8 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\nae Dershouitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4355", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6l of 349\nOn that same day, Villafatia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia recetved any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can nghtly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged ln sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida ““with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4358", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 63 of 349\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 72 of 349\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office. With\nrespect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say\nthat disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the\nforgoten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified\nas a lapse in judgment. This Office should seek to foster spirited\ndebate about the law and the use of prosecutorial discretion... .\n[M]y first and only concern in this case (and my other <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nexploitation cases) is the victims.

If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou. ”°\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.””, Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4369", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation often possessed <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 74 of 349\nequipment.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo9 of 349\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l29 of 349\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou.

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®” Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4427", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l39 of 349\n\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes, 78\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last!

The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask.

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary.

The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime.

With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

(Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4562", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29o of 349\nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.\"!3\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne § Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafaia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\noa According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4587", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 325 of 349\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

Losada, 674 F.2d l67, l69 (2d Cir. l982).4\nThere, as here, any barrier to prosecution of the defendant arose from the agreement with the\nprosecution, not the Double Jeopardy Clause. And, as described above, the NPA presents no\nbarrier. Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six should be denied.\n\nIl. Counts Five and Six Are Timely\n\nCounts Five and Six are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse . . .\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” at any time “during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,” and the victim identified in Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment remains alive. The crimes alleged in Counts Five and Six plainly involved\nthe sexual abuse of minors, meaning the § 3283 limitations period applies to both charges. See S2\nIndictment 4 9(d) (discussing the sexual abuse of Minor Victim-4).\n\nIn her motion, the defendant argues that § 3283 only applies if the elements of the crime\nof sex trafficking “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of minors. (Def. Mot. at 2o-2l). In other\nwords, the defendant claims that the “categorical approach” or “essential ingredients” test applies\nhere. The Court has already considered and rejected this argument. (Apr. Op. at 9-l3). As this\nCourt has held, “[t]o the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts,\nit is inappropriate here.” (Apr. Op. at ll). Instead, with respect to the statute of limitations, the\n* Although the opinions do not say whether the prosecuting office that signed the plea agreement\nwas the same office that later prosecuted the Losadas, the prosecution also does not appear to have\nresisted the plea agreement on that basis. See Cambindo-Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638.\n> In her previous motions, the defendant argued that Counts One through Four were untimely,\nclaiming that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively. The Court rejected this argument. (Apr. Op.\nat l3-l6 (analyzing the applicability of § 3283 to pre-2oo3 conduct under Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994))). In her current motion, the defendant does not appear to\nassert retroactivity arguments with respect to Counts Five and Six. Nor could she. Because Counts\nFive and Six involve conduct up to and including 2oo4, application of the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not require the Court to engage in a retroactivity analysis.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4722", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page8ofl4\n\nThe Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its\nApril l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call fora\n“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULB.C, § 3299,\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgraf v. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Tn]Jotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to prosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4982", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005121.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-2 Filed o9/o7/2l Page 9 of 2l\nas his lawyer Marty Weinberg would earnestly characterize Epstein’s\nbehavior modification at his bond hearing in federal court in New York on\nJuly l5, 2ol9.

CERTAIN EVIDENCE OR ARGUMENT THAT MINOR VICTIMS\n\nCONSENTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE MAY BE ADMISSIBLE.\n\nThe government seeks blanket preclusion of evidence or argument that the accusers\n“consented to sexual abuse.” It bears noting that the Indictment does not charge sexual abuse.\nThe charged offenses allege “sexual activity” (Counts One through Four) and “sex trafficking”\n(Counts Five and Six).\n\nThe age of consent for sexual contact purposes varies by jurisdiction. The offenses\ncharged in the S2 Indictment allege sexual activity with minors and focus on age, rather than\nmental or physical incapacity. Accordingly, to qualify as sexual activity with a minor, the statute\nmust prohibit sexual acts based at least on age of the purported victim. See Esquival-Quintana v.\nSessions, l37 S. Ct. l562 (2ol7). As the Supreme Court noted, “state criminal codes aid our\ninterpretation of ‘sexual abuse of a minor’ by offering useful context.” /d. at l577 n.3. For\npurposes of sexual activity alleged in this case, the definition of “minor” varies among states and\nnations: New York defines “minor” as a person under the age of l77%; Florida: under the age of\nl8°; United Kingdom: under the age of l6°°; France: under the age of l5.7! New Mexico does\nnot have a specific age of consent statute but criminalizes all sexual contact of a minor under the\nage of l3 when no coercion or force is involved.*” In the context of the charged offense focusing\n°8 NY Penal Law Ann. § l3o.o3(3)(a).\n\n»?

The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or\nUsing First Names, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits\nThe Government seeks limited, narrouly tailored relief to protect the victims in this case.\nCertain of the Minor Victims have not publicly identified themselves as victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse by the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein, or have not done so in the same level of detail as they\nare expected to provide at trial. Consistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, see l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8), and the regular practice in this District and the Eastern District, (see Gov’t Mot. at 6-\n8 (citing twelve cases)), the Government asks the Court to permit those Minor Victims to testify\nusing either pseudonyms or first names, and for related relief regarding other witnesses and\nexhibits to protect the identities of the same Minor Victims. To the extent this request presents\nlogistical concerns, they are readily solvable in this case, as they were in United States v. Kelly,\nNo. l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.), United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y.),\nand numerous other recent sex trafficking trials, including high-profile sex trafficking trials and\nones in which victims had made prior public statements. The Government has not sought to\nwithhold the identities of the Minor Victims from the defense or the jury, so this request has no\neffect whatsoever on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.\n\nThe defendant’s primary response is to Fy\neee\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5558", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 Filed lo/29/2l Page5of4o\nee. That misses the point entirely. The Court must decide whether to protect the\nprivacy of four victims who will testify in a criminal trial, for the first time in their lives, about the\npainful details of the sexual abuse they were subjected to as children. The answer to that question\nis emphatically yes.\n\nThe defense has failed to articulate any particularized need to publicize the full names of\nthe Minor Victims. Nor could they, since the full names are knoun to the defense and the Court,\nand will be knoun to the jurors in this case. And the Government’s narrouly tailored proposal\nbalances the public interest in access to information with the Minor Victims’ right to privacy and\ndignity. The Court should grant the motion.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Government explained in its motions (Gov’t Mot. at 4-9), if the Government\nprovides a reason to “limit disclosure of identifying information in open court,” the defendant must\n“demonstrate a ‘particularized need’ for disclosure . .. which the court weighs against the risks to\nthe witness.” United States v. Marcus, No. o5 Cr. 457 (ARR), 2oo7 WL 33o388, at *l (E.D.N.Y.\nJan. 3l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Marti, 42l F.2d l263, l266 (2d Cir. l97o); United States v.\nBennet, 4o9 F.2d 888, 9ol (2d Cir. l969)), aff'd, 628 F.3d 36, 45 n.l2 (2d Cir. 2olo)); see United\nStates v. Urena, 8 F. Supp. 3d 568, 572-73 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (permiting an undercover law\nenforcement officer to testify under a pseudonym, after balancing the relevant interests); cf’ United\nStates v. Cavallaro, 553 F.2d 3oo, 3o4 (2d Cir. l977) (“[W]here the government voices a\nlegitimate concern for a witness’ safety, the trial court must balance the potential danger to the\nwitness against the need of the defense for the information.”).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5559", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 4o\na\nevery reason to believe that, if the Court orders that Minor Victims be permited to testify under\npseudonyms, many major publications will honor that request and not rebroadcast the Minor\nVictims’ names should they surface elsewhere. The Government does not assume that the\nmainstream press would reveal the identity of a victim against her wishes, particularly if the victim\nis testifying under Court-ordered protections to preserve her anonymity. Furthermore, the\nGovernment’s understanding from conferring with prosecutors in similar cases is that the\nmainstream press did not, in fact, reveal the identities of victims who testified under court-ordered\nprotections. And in any event, even marginally reduced exposure is significant to the Minor\nVictims.* There is a very meaningful difference between the names of victims appearing in some\ndark corner of the internet, and the names of the victims appearing in the news outlets that will be\nviewed by the friends, families (including children), and employers of the Minor Victims.\n\nD. The Defendant Has No Countervailing Interests at Stake, Much Less a Particularized\n\nNeed for Disclosure.\n\nIn the context of the disclosure of witness identifying information, the Second Circuit has\nidentified two primary interests of defendants: “(l) obtaining information needed for in-court and\nout-of-court investigation of the witness; and (2) enabling defense counsel to elicit information\nee\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo557l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 4o\nprivate rather than public,” which avoids “catering” to “sensational” interests. (Gov’t Mot. at l6\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995); United States v. Cohen, 366\nF. Supp. 3d 6l2, 626-627 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (alterations and internal quotation marks omited)).\nThis limited sealing request is significantly protective of the interests of the Minor Victims, who\nwere sexually abused as minors, and minimally burdensome to the public. See Paris, 2oo7 WL\nl484974, at *2 (concluding that the interest in protecting victim identities outweighs the public\ninterest in access to information because “the public and press will be able to hear the Jane Does’\nand Minors’ testimony in full’); cf. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9 (d)(2) (permiting any papers that disclose\nthe name of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to be filed under seal without the necessity of a court order). !”\n\nAlthough the defense argues that this request is “contrary to well-established Second\nCircuit Law” (Def. Opp. at 23), the cases it cites concern the strong presumption in favor of access\nassociated with public dissemination of records that are already shared publicly at trial. See United\nStates v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l49 (2d Cir. 2ool); Application of National Broadcasting Co.,\n635 F.2d 945, 95l-52 (2d Cir. l98o). Both cases also recognize that no such presumption applies\nfor evidence submited under seal, “because with respect to that item of evidence, the session of\ncourt was not public.” Graham, 257 F.3d at l49 (quoting Application of National Broadcasting\nCo., 635 F.2d at 952 n.4). Here, the Government is not seeking a limitation on information shared\nin open court, so these cases are inapposite.\n\nTo the extent the defense wishes to make arguments about particular exhibits, (see Def. Opp. at\n22-23), the Government is happy to address that on a document-by-document basis at trial.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5575", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of24\nUnited States v.

Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\n?

To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the conclusion\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee’s Note to the 2ooo\nAmendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual molestation, especially those by compliant <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3 (precluding “grooming” testimony from\npsychologist in prosecution for traveling in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in sex\nwith a minor because psychologist’s “experience in the field of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abusers and their\nvictims is one-sided, as it is limited to therapeutic sessions with victims of sexual abuse,” and\nbecause she did “not treat or diagnose adult abusers of children”). Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l-NGG-\nVMS, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see also Celebrity Cruises Inc. v.\nEssef Corp., 434 F.

Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 594. Rocchio’s opinions are\ngrooming-by-proxy are nothing but prejudicial speculation. See Wehling v.

Rocchio’s grooming opinions will not assist the trier of fact.\n\nNone of Rocchio’s opinions about grooming will “assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 59l (“‘Fit’ is not always obvious,\nand scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated\npurposes.”’). As in Raymond and United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does not propose\nto have [Rocchio] relate [her] general opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts\nin this case.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3. Expert testimony about general principles is\nhelpful only when it “describe[es] widely recognized and highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena.” Raymond, 7oo F.

Roccio’s grooming opinions are substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is also inadmissible under Rule 4o3. For one thing, it will\n“radically simplify” an otherwise complex case. See United States v. Burns, No. o7 CR 556,\n2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2oo9) (criticizing the “grooming theory” in in the\ncontext of a sentencing guidelines calculation). As the Court explained in United States v. Burns,\nRocchio’s “grooming theory” can “foist a damning teleology on a series of actions each of which\nmight have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all. . . radically simplifyi[ng] the\nmess of .. . competing feelings, urges, and needs over the course of [a] relationship into the neat\ndichotomy of victim and predator.” Jd. See Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (to describe the\nso-called “atributes of a sexual predator” is to “invite the jury to so label a defendant” a sexual\npredator).\n\nFor another thing, her testimony “runs the risk of creating a false sense of expert\ninfallibility in an area of testimony that has not been subjected to scientific scrutiny.” Gonyer,\n2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (citing Raymond, 7oo F.Supp.2d at l5o (“a toxic mixture of purported\nexpertise and common sense”)). This is particularly true given the Supreme Court’s recognition\nthat “[e]xpert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in\nevaluating it.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nWere there any doubt about the reliability or relevance of Rocchio’s grooming opinions,\nwhich there isn’t, the Court should still exclude her testimony under Rule 4o3.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo564o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d.

Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5646", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 2\n7/94 - 7/95 Pre-Doctoral Intern in Psychology\nYale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT\nNew Haven Hospital and Yale Psychiatric Institute\n9/93 - 5/94 Clinical Psychology Extern\nCounseling Center, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI\n5/9l - 5/94 Clinical Psychology Trainee\nPsychological Consultation Center, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI\n9/92 - 5/93 Clinical Psychology Extern\nPsychological Services, Broun University, Providence, RI\n6/9o - 8/9o Family Service Student Counselor\n7/9l - 8/9l Pre-Natal Clinic, St. Joseph's Hospital\nDepartment of Family Service, Providence, RI\nTRAINING AND CONSULTATION EXPERIENCE\n2ooo - 2oo2 Psychological Consultant\nNorth Providence School Department\nPerformed comprehensive psychological evaluations of elementary school students\nto determine the impact of psychological difficulties on school performance and\nfunctioning.

Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l2 of 84\nthat bonds victims to their abusers and prevents victims from disclosing that they have been\nabused. !\n\nThese opinions stem in part from Dr. Rocchio’s personal familiarity and experience\ntreating victims of sexual abuse for decades. She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology. Cf Bosco v. United States, No. l4 Civ. 3525 (JFK),\n2ol6 WL 53762o5, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6) (expert testimony about “common knouledge\namong urologists” require the expert to “draw upon the defining characteristics that make him a\nmember of that community: his training as a urological surgeon, his practical experience\nperforming several hundred ureteroscopies, and his knouledge as a clinical instructor of surgery”).\n\nThese opinions also stem from the relevant literature. This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the literature of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Alternatively, offenders may\ntarget children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation\nomited)).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 957, 964-68 (2ol4) (reviewing the literature on\nthe prevalence of various grooming techniques); Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children:\nReview of literature and theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6)\n(“[R]etrospective identification of sexual grooming, l.e. after a sexual offence has been commited,\nis much easier than prospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence”). To be clear, houever,\nher review of the literature—and therefore the basis of her testimony—extends beyond these\narticles.\n\nAccordingly, Dr. Rocchio came to her opinions through her clinical experience on this\nspecific issue, as informed by her education and study of the relevant literature. That is a sufficient\ndemonstration of “hou the expert came to [her] conclusion and what methodologies or evidence\nsubstantiate that conclusion.” Riegel v.

See supra pp. 7-8. Courts\nhave also specifically authorized expert testimony on the subject of grooming. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

Halamek, 5 F 4th lo8l, lo87-89\n(9th Cir. 2o2l) (holding that expert testimony on grooming was “relevant, reliable, and properly\nadmited”); United States v. Isabella, 9l8 F.3d 8l6, 833 n.l5 (loth Cir. 2ol9) (“Grooming can be\nestablished by use of an expert witness who testifies about psychological tactics that are common\nin cases of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse.”); United States v. Hit, 473 F.3d l46, l58 (Sth Cir. 2oo6) (affirming\nexpert testimony on the “grooming process”); Morris v. State, 36l S.W.3d 649, 656-69 (Tx. Ct.\nCrim.

Cabrera, l3 F.4th l4o (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(noting that evidence of grooming supported the jury’s verdict).\n\nAgainst this weight of authority, the defendant relies principally on one case from the\nDistrict of Maine.

The proposed\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5797", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l5 of 84\ntestimony in this case is readily distinguishable from that in Raymond. There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47. The purported expert’s book, in turn, merely made assertions about the “profile” of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nmolesters, with no information about hou his experiences reliably led to his conclusions. /d. at\nl47-48. In the same breath, houever, the book “disavou[ed] [its] reliability .. . for legal use,” and\nhis article similarly offered generalized views on what “many” offenders were “more likely or less\nlikely to do.” Jd. at l48 (emphasis omited). Accordingly, at botom, the purported expert’s\ntestimony was based only on his subjective conclusions after reviewing case studies. See id. at\nl47 n.5 (explaining that the expert “troubling[ly]” wrote that “data is not the plural of anecdote,”\nbut “the information and opinions are based primarily on the totality of my acquired knouledge\nand expertise’).\n\nThe situation here is quite different. Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic literature and her formal and informal education.

Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant literature, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work. By virtue of her\nexperience treating victims, Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’ actions. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88 (“Extensive experience interviewing victims can qualify a person to\ntestify about the relationships those victims tend to have with their abusers.”).

Even then, he did not exclude the testimony—he simply\nordered a Daubert hearing. Jd. at *8. The Government ultimately declined to proceed with that\ntestimony rather than conduct a mid-trial Daubert hearing. Here, and as noted above, Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony concerns the experience of manipulated and coerced victims, rather\nthan the intentions of perpetrators.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 84\nreturn to Epstein’s home for sexual abuse, or why some occasionally expressed affection for the\ndefendant and Epstein.\n\nAlthough Dr. Rocchio will not testify about these specific Minor Victims, her testimony\nwill help the jurors understand the “psychological dynamic often seen in abusive relationships that\nleads an abuse victim to behave in counterintuitive ways, such as by declining to take opportunities\nto leave an abusive situation or by expressing gratitude to an abuser.” Torres, 2o2l WL l9475o3,\nat *7. This psychological dynamic between a victim of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and her abusers is\n“beyond the knouledge of the average juror and would or could plainly be helpful in understanding\nthe psychological dynamics at play.” Oct. l7, 2ol9 Tr. at 27:3-7, United States v. Dupigny, No.\nl8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98; cf’ See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 38:l3-2o, United States\nv. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (“[B]y and large the relationship between\nprostitutes and pimps is not the subject of common knouledge.

Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def. Mot. at lo).\n* Relying again on Raymond, the District of Maine case, the defendant argues that expert testimony\nabout “general principles is helpful only when it ‘describes widely recognized and highly\npredictable and verifiable phenomena.’” (Def. Mot. lo (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o\nn.l2 (alterations omited)). That proposition comes from footnote l2 of Raymond, which\natempted to distinguish that expert’s “profile” testimony from the Federal Rules Advisory\nCommitee’s observation that the 2ooo amendment “does not alter the venerable practice of using\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 24 of 84\n\nThe defense argues that this opinion is outside Dr. Rocchio’s expertise because she has “‘no\nexperience treating alleged perpetrators,” so “her view . . . is entirely one-sided.” (/d.). As is clear\nfrom the above excerpt, her testimony is about largely about trust and atachment built in victims,\nand the resultant ways in which victims process abuse. But she is also an expert in the actions and\ntechniques of perpetrators through her review of the literature and the lens of what she has learned\nthrough victims. This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio’s expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 7o4, because it is an “opinion\nthat the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,” and 4o3, because it “risks jurors\naccepting her ‘expert’ opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.”\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l3). Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated the victims in this case and will not express an\nopinion as to whether they are testifying truthfully. And the defense motion is entirely unclear on\nthe features of this expert opinion that create risk that the jurors would abdicate their\nresponsibilities. To the contrary, the defense concerns underscore hou relevant this opinion will\nbe in aiding the jurors in understanding the testimony at trial.\n\n3. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Long-Term Consequences of Abuse is Admissible\n\nDr. Rocchio will also testify that “[r]epeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at\n2). As Dr. Rocchio will explain, and as is detailed in her Jencks Act material®, experiencing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n® The Government produced Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material to the defense at the time of the\nexpert notice. (See Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (“The Government is producing notes from the\nGovernment’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.”)).\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties. See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, reducing the likelihood of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay disclosure is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\nexplanation—is readily visible in the news. See also 2 Mod. Sci. Evid. § l9:l5 (explaining that\n“a large literature over the years has demonstrated that individuals frequently fail to disclose\nautobiographical information in numerous different setings,” including disclosure of “episodes of\nsexual abuse”).\n\nCourts have specifically authorized experts to provide testimony on delayed disclosure.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gaudet, 933 F.3d ll, l5-l6 (lst Cir. 2ol9) (“Moreover, the government\nprovided expert testimony from Dr. Ann Burgess. . . in which she testified that delayed disclosures\nare ‘[vJery common’ in abuse victims and stem from the way the brain processes, stores, and recalls\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 84\ntraumatic experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7\n(admiting expert testimony that “disclosure by sexual assault victims often unfolds over time, and\nthe process of disclosure is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited\nto, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the\nvictim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her patern of recovery and coping”); United States v.\nYoung, 623 F. App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed\ndisclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...\n[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had atacked the\nvictims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Betcher, 534 F.3d 82o, 826 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (“In this\ncase, Dr. Levit’s testimony as to delayed disclosure helped the jury understand why the girls did\nnot reveal they had been photographed until they were confronted with the images.”).\n\nThe defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions on delayed disclosure are not helpful\nto the jury because they are too generic. As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nsexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 84\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 52 of 84\nand knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact with minor girls.

And\nit shous the defendant’s specific modus operandi of the conspiracies in the Indictment. For these\nand the other reasons described above, Minor Victim-3’s testimony easily satisfies Rule 4o4(b)’s\nrequirements.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4of 43\n\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 959\n\ncapture the notion of grooming because these already involve illegal and\n\nabusive contract with a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, gaining the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s compliance and maintaining the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 7 of 43\n962 N.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters”\nand “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters are much more common than <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5875", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005876.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for an outing, or drove\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to initiate contact with\nme. Get the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> away from the institution (thus isolating the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>), 22% gave the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> extra atention, 22% gave money to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, 9%\nprovided the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with illicit goods, and 4% provided the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5877", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne difference has been found between genders of the victim in this\nemotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> became resistant and then persuaded the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them.

She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l4 of 43\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 969\n\nl. Minimize false negatives. Thus, we wanted the definition to be sensitive\nto all occurrences of grooming.\n\n2. Minimize false positives. Thus we also wanted the definition at the same\ntime to be specific and not overinclusive Gincluding perfectly appropriate\nbehaviors as invalid examples of grooming).\n\n3. Be capable of providing the basis for a valid assessment procedure.\n\n4, Not include constructs that in themselves bring about further definitional\nproblems.\n\n5. Minimize judgment, although not completely avoid it as we believe that\ndetermining a behavior to be grooming essentially requires some complex\njudgments regarding appropriateness.\n\n6. Shou interrater reliability (have a high degree of agreement across raters).\n\n7. Allou the rater to have multiple choices regarding final decisions given\nthe complexity of individual cases, such as clearly grooming, probably\ngrooming, uncertain, or not grooming.\n\n8. Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., telling the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\n4, Inappropriate touching of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., excessive tickling, hugging,\nwrestling, siting on lap).\n5. Bribes for inappropriate contact (e.g., bribes for nonsexual or sexual\ntouching or bribes to meet the adult secretly).\n6. Threats related to not participating in inappropriate contact.\n7. Inappropriate isolation of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., trips where the offender and\nvictim are alone that are not part of the normal adult—<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> relationship.\nIt is permissible for a father to drive a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to schooD, or inappropriately\ndiscouraging the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to play with friends or be with family. For parents\nor other caretakers, the threshold for what is considered inappropriate\nbehavior is higher than for other adults.\n8. Favoritism directed touard the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is treated much beter\nthan siblings or classmates, particularly when this is intimate or isolating).\n9. Boundary violations such as inappropriately bathing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, clothing the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, sleeping with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the adult being in underwear around the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the adult acting like a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, or the adult sharing private information\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, particularly sexual or relationship information (e.g., “my\nwife and I are not having sex”). Again, for parents, family members or\ncaregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation\nthan for others.\nlo. Asking the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to keep secrets, particularly about their contact (e.g.,\nthe mother’s Christmas present would not be regarded as a problematic\nsecret, whereas asking the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to not tell that she was with the offender\nwould be).\nll. Providing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> drugs or alcohol (note: although this behavior is\nalready abusive, it is not sexually abusive; thus, it can be consid-\nered a grooming behavior as it is inappropriate and serves to facilitate\ncompliance with the intended sexual abuse).\nl2. Misstating moral standards regarding touching, contact, or sex, particularly\nwhen these relate to adult—<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual contact or sexualizing a situation.\nl3. Repeated violations of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it\nmay be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming\nbehaviors that may be misinterpreted:\nl. Purchasing appropriate gifts for the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., for birthdays).\n2. Engaging in appropriate hand-holding (e.g., to cross the street).\n3. Bathing a young <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> by a legitimate caregiver without any inappropriate\n\ntouching.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5882", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l7 of 43\n\n972 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5884", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nguardian should always be present when the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, does not isolate the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5885", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngrooming and the prevention of future abuse (by perhaps a comparison with\na no treatment contro). Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse,” “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molestation,” or “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005891.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 24 of\n3o journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\nsani\nFigure |.

Groth and Birnbaum accurately describe the pro-\ncess (at p. l42-l43), but do not use the term “grooming.”\n\nFigure l shous hou the maximum number of publications in the database\nusing the term “grooming” for this meaning! has increased since l984. For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning. From l99o-l999, the annual frequency rose from eight\nto 63, and from 2ooo to 2oo9, from 64 to 227. From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005892.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, time alone with\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5892", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005893.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a connection would be found between the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005894.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> did not resist, or that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5894", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005895.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> are not adequately met by the\nparents, the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5895", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005896.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the\nenvironment and significant others and grooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, some level of motivation to abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 43\n29o — S. Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo59ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to the subsequent targeting of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, through the\njustification or denial of the steps <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual offenders take touards abusing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> begins with identifying a vulnerable <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (van Dam, 2ool). <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n\nGrooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> on the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexually (Leberg, l997). The <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\ncreates a barrier which prevents the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nand/or the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Specific goals include gaining access to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, gaining the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s compliance and maintaining the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, gaining the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> protection and the policing and\ntreatment of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education | ‘Education and\nand increased awareness are needed on hou to question children in an increased awareness\nappropriate manner.

In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case.

The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week.

The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\n<span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 52\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s opinions are thus unreliable, the government says: “If the\nvictim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference whether the\nperpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing the victim\nfor abuse by a third party.” Resp. at 26.\n\nHardly. It makes all the difference in the world because Ms. Maxwell is on trial, not Mr.\nEpstein. The logic (such as it is) of grooming evidence is that the perpetrator normalizes sexual\nbehavior to facilitate his later abuse of the victim. But because Ms. Maxwell did not abuse\nanyone, there is no basis to conclude that anything she did was “grooming.” The government\nthus intends to have Rocchio characterize innocent conduct by Ms. Maxwell as something more\nnefarious, thereby further blurring the line that experts are already unable to draw reliably.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page4ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and subjective. (/d. at 4). But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> begins with recognizing a vulnerable <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex. A at 4).

Dr. Dietz is not remotely competent to opine that Epstein would “surround himself\nwith people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that he was able to “use his brilliance to\nmanipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which\nnone had complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. Dietz has absolutely no basis\nto make such broad and sweeping factual claims about Epstein or his relationships with anyone,\nmuch less anyone in this case. It appears that Dr. Dietz has reached his conclusions based solely\non one interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in which Epstein “acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged in discovery (Def. Expert\nNotice Ex. C, atached as Exhibit B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests\nthat Epstein looked to the halos of others, not that he generated one himself. And it is no basis, at\nall, for Dr. Dietz to suggest to the jury that anyone involved in this case did anything because of\nEpstein’s “halo.”\n\nThis factual narration of Epstein’s life and apparently the lives of other people who\ninteracted with him, a defense summation based on a nullification defense masquerading as an\nexpert witness opinion, is not based on any competent evidence, and in any event is patently not\nthe product of reliable psychiatric methods reliably applied to this case. See, e.g., Island Intell.\n> This would not be the first unreliable factual claim made by Dr. Dietz, who testified in a previous\ncriminal case that a defendant got the idea of drouning her children in the bathtub from an episode\nof Law & Order in which a defendant did so and was acquited on an insanity defense, when in\nfact no such episode existed. See generally e.g., Barnete v. United States, No. l2 Civ. 327, 2o2l\nWL 949848, *9-lo (W.D.N.C. March l2, 2o2l). This led to the reversal of the trial conviction of\nthe defendant in that case. See Yates v. State, l7l S.W.3d 2l5, 222 (Tex. App. 2oo5).\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 4l\nsuch an opinion is irrelevant and should be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the extensive literature on grooming, the pimp-prostitute relationship, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 29 of 4l\nwidespread or general acceptance, or are otherwise reliable.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6256", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page5ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6257", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4 of 29\nlo8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nthat occurred while he or she was under the influence or while experienc-\ning the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may atempt to make\nsense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events\nthat occurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize\nwhat memories are intact, a person may confabulate or fill in the memory\nlapses with events that seem probable or which for some reason they come\nto believe “must have” taken place. For example, waking up naked but not\nremembering hou his or her clothes were removed, a person may conclude\nthat someone else removed the clothes without his or her consent, even\nif the individual had, while intoxicated, actually removed his or her oun\nclothes without remembering having done so. In addition, some drugs can\nartificially affect sexual interest (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine) or modify the indi-\nvidual’s normal disinhibitions regarding sexuality that can affect the analysis\nof sexual consent. Thus, an individual may not normally have been sexually\ninterested or may typically have been more sexually inhibited and not given\nconsent. She may come to be puzzled after a sexual interaction and con-\nclude that she was sexually assaulted because her behavior did not fit with\nher expectations.\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (or Conduct Disorder\nin Adolescents)\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) explains the essen-\ntial feature of antisocial personality disorder as “a pervasive patern or\ndisregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in early <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>-\nhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.” Diagnostic criteria\nconsist of the follouing:\nl. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as\nindicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;\n2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning\nothers for personal profit or pleasure;\n3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;\n4, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or\nassaults;\n5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;\n6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain\nconsistent work behavior or honor financial obligations; and\n7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing\nhaving hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.\nDiagnostic criteria l, 2, 4, and 7 are of particular importance in this\npathway.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse,” “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molestation,” or “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006301.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page4of:\n3o journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\nsani\nFigure |.

Groth and Birnbaum accurately describe the pro-\ncess (at p. l42-l43), but do not use the term “grooming.”\n\nFigure l shous hou the maximum number of publications in the database\nusing the term “grooming” for this meaning! has increased since l984. For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning. From l99o-l999, the annual frequency rose from eight\nto 63, and from 2ooo to 2oo9, from 64 to 227. From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006302.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of:\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, time alone with\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006303.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6of:\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a connection would be found between the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “...[W]here father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “. . . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “[T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006304.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7 of:\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> did not resist, or that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006305.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8of:\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> are not adequately met by the\nparents, the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949),\n\ne “Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006306.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9Qof:\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Nor would admission of these opinions cause unfair Rule 4o3 prejudice since\nthey are relevant rebutal to impeachment points that the Defense will put in issue.\n\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not relevant because the Government\nrepresents that she will testify only to general principles and not offer “testimony regarding any\nspecific victim.” Dkt. No. 386 at 3. The Defense has the law backwards on this point. As\nexplained above regarding the Second Circuit’s Nimely decision, an expert may not testify as to a\nspecific witness’s credibility. 4l4 F.3d at 398. And as other courts have explained in admiting\nsimilar testimony, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is appropriate because she does not testify as to any\nspecific witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at\n*7; Johnson, 86o F.3d at ll4o (8th Cir. 2ol7) (explaining that an expert may testify “regarding\nthe general characteristics that sexually abused children exhibit” but may not usurp the jury’s\nrole of assessing the credibility of any specific victim); United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86,\nlo97-98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (same).\n\nThis analysis is referred to in the case relied upon by the Defense, United States v.\nRaymond, and in portions of the Defense’s briefing, as a question of “fit.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d at\nl49. But Daubert’s “fit” requirement is really just a specialized relevance inquiry that asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document435 Filed ll/ll/2l Pageloofll\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). For the reasons already provided, the\nCourt finds that fit is satisfied here.\n\nThird, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not substantially outweighed by\n4o3 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would not unduly\n““simplify’ an otherwise complex case” or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt.\nNo. 386 at ll. Dr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty.\nThe more general nature of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which the Court heard in detail at the\nDaubert hearing, therefore mitigates its prejudicial effect. Telles, 6 F.4th at lo97. It is the jury’s\nrole to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s opinions apply to the facts of this case and the\ncredibility of the witnesses.\n\nLast, as previously mentioned, the Court will grant in part the Defense’s Daubert motion.\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that grooming can be done to facilitate sexual\nabuse by a third party or that the presence of a third party can otherwise facilitate grooming is\nunreliable. The Defense calls this “grooming-by-proxy.” F.g., Dkt. No. 386 at 9. Terminology\naside, the Court agrees with this narrouer objection to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. As discussed at\nthe hearing, this phenomenon is not identified in the relevant literature regarding <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse and has not been subjected to peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to\nbe an extrapolation of the broader principle of hou grooming functions through the development\nof trust. That extrapolation may be logical and follou common sense, but it is for the jury to\nmake on the facts of this case. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that the\npresence of a third party can facilitate grooming. Dr. Rocchio’s core opinions about grooming,\nhouever, remain admissible under the Rule 7o2 and Daubert standard and remain relevant\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 54 of 69\nVI. CERTAIN EVIDENCE OR ARGUMENT THAT MINOR VICTIMS\n\nCONSENTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE MAY BE ADMISSIBLE.\n\nThe government seeks blanket preclusion of evidence or argument that the accusers\n“consented to sexual abuse.” It bears noting that the Indictment does not charge sexual abuse.\nThe charged offenses allege “sexual activity” (Counts One through Four) and “sex trafficking”\n(Counts Five and Six).\n\nThe age of consent for sexual contact purposes varies by jurisdiction. The offenses\ncharged in the S2 Indictment allege sexual activity with minors and focus on age, rather than\nmental or physical incapacity. Accordingly, to qualify as sexual activity with a minor, the statute\nmust prohibit sexual acts based at least on age of the purported victim. See Esquival-Quintana v.\nSessions, l37 S. Ct. l562 (2ol7). As the Supreme Court noted, “state criminal codes aid our\ninterpretation of ‘sexual abuse of a minor’ by offering useful context.” /d. at l577 n.3. For\npurposes of sexual activity alleged in this case, the definition of “minor” varies among states and\nnations: New York defines “minor” as a person under the age of l77%; Florida: under the age of\nl8°; United Kingdom: under the age of l6°°; France: under the age of l5.7! New Mexico does\nnot have a specific age of consent statute but criminalizes all sexual contact of a minor under the\nage of l3 when no coercion or force is involved.*” In the context of the charged offense focusing\n°8 NY Penal Law Ann. § l3o.o3(3)(a).\n\n»?

The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or\nUsing First Names, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits\nThe Government seeks limited, narrouly tailored relief to protect the victims in this case.\nCertain of the Minor Victims have not publicly identified themselves as victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse by the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein, or have not done so in the same level of detail as they\nare expected to provide at trial. Consistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, see l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8), and the regular practice in this District and the Eastern District, (see Gov’t Mot. at 6-\n8 (citing twelve cases)), the Government asks the Court to permit those Minor Victims to testify\nusing either pseudonyms or first names, and for related relief regarding other witnesses and\nexhibits to protect the identities of the same Minor Victims. To the extent this request presents\nlogistical concerns, they are readily solvable in this case, as they were in United States v. Kelly,\nNo. l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.), United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y.),\nand numerous other recent sex trafficking trials, including high-profile sex trafficking trials and\nones in which victims had made prior public statements. The Government has not sought to\nwithhold the identities of the Minor Victims from the defense or the jury, so this request has no\neffect whatsoever on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.\n\nThe defendant’s primary response is to Fy\neee\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo652o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006521.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of 4o\nee. That misses the point entirely. The Court must decide whether to protect the\nprivacy of four victims who will testify in a criminal trial, for the first time in their lives, about the\npainful details of the sexual abuse they were subjected to as children. The answer to that question\nis emphatically yes.\n\nThe defense has failed to articulate any particularized need to publicize the full names of\nthe Minor Victims. Nor could they, since the full names are knoun to the defense and the Court,\nand will be knoun to the jurors in this case. And the Government’s narrouly tailored proposal\nbalances the public interest in access to information with the Minor Victims’ right to privacy and\ndignity. The Court should grant the motion.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Government explained in its motions (Gov’t Mot. at 4-9), if the Government\nprovides a reason to “limit disclosure of identifying information in open court,” the defendant must\n“demonstrate a ‘particularized need’ for disclosure . .. which the court weighs against the risks to\nthe witness.” United States v.

The Government does not assume that the\nmainstream press would reveal the identity of a victim against her wishes, particularly if the victim\nis testifying under Court-ordered protections to preserve her anonymity. Furthermore, the\nGovernment’s understanding from conferring with prosecutors in similar cases is that the\nmainstream press did not, in fact, reveal the identities of victims who testified under court-ordered\nprotections. And in any event, even marginally reduced exposure is significant to the Minor\nVictims.° There is a very meaningful difference between the names of victims appearing in some\ndark corner of the internet, and the names of the victims appearing in the news outlets that will be\nviewed by the friends, families (including children), and employers of the Minor Victims.\n\nD.

Supp. 3d 6l2, 626-627 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (alterations and internal quotation marks omited)).\nThis limited sealing request is significantly protective of the interests of the Minor Victims, who\nwere sexually abused as minors, and minimally burdensome to the public. See Paris, 2oo7 WL\nl484974, at *2 (concluding that the interest in protecting victim identities outweighs the public\ninterest in access to information because “the public and press will be able to hear the Jane Does’\nand Minors’ testimony in full’); cf. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9 (d)(2) (permiting any papers that disclose\nthe name of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to be filed under seal without the necessity of a court order). !”\n\nAlthough the defense argues that this request is “contrary to well-established Second\nCircuit Law” (Def. Opp. at 23), the cases it cites concern the strong presumption in favor of access\nassociated with public dissemination of records that are already shared publicly at trial. See United\nStates v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l49 (2d Cir. 2ool); Application of National Broadcasting Co.,\n635 F.2d 945, 95l-52 (2d Cir. l98o). Both cases also recognize that no such presumption applies\nfor evidence submited under seal, “because with respect to that item of evidence, the session of\ncourt was not public.” Graham, 257 F.3d at l49 (quoting Application of National Broadcasting\nCo., 635 F.2d at 952 n.4). Here, the Government is not seeking a limitation on information shared\nin open court, so these cases are inapposite.\n\nTo the extent the defense wishes to make arguments about particular exhibits, (see Def. Opp. at\n22-23), the Government is happy to address that on a document-by-document basis at trial.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6537", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page4of24\nUnited States v.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\n?

To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the conclusion\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee’s Note to the 2ooo\nAmendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual molestation, especially those by compliant <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited). This Court should apply the teachings of Raymond\nto this case.\n\nFinally, Rocchio is a treatment provider of alleged victims of trauma, including victims\nof sexual assault. But she has no experience treating or evaluating alleged perpetrators of sexual\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6599", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel4 of 24\nassault. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3 (precluding “grooming” testimony from\npsychologist in prosecution for traveling in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in sex\nwith a minor because psychologist’s “experience in the field of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abusers and their\nvictims is one-sided, as it is limited to therapeutic sessions with victims of sexual abuse,” and\nbecause she did “not treat or diagnose adult abusers of children”). Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l-NGG-\nVMS, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see also Celebrity Cruises Inc. v.\nEssef Corp., 434 F. Supp. 2d l69, l92 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (expert not “permited to testify\nregarding” subjects “outside the expertise of the witness’’).\n\n2. Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 594. Rocchio’s opinions are\ngrooming-by-proxy are nothing but prejudicial speculation. See Wehling v. Sandoz Pharms.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel5 of 24\nCorp., l62 F.3d ll58, at *5 (4th Cir. l998) (unpublished) (“An ‘expert’ opinion is considered\nunreliable and inadmissible under Daubert where, as here, the expert has developed the opinions\nexpressly for purposes of testifying in the case, has [herself] performed no tests or studies that\nsupport [her] opinions, has cited no peer-reviewed, controlled studies substantiating [her]\nopinions, and fails to point to some objective source to shou that [she has] folloued the\nscientific method.” (cleaned up)).\n\n3. Rocchio’s grooming opinions will not assist the trier of fact.\n\nNone of Rocchio’s opinions about grooming will “assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 59l (“‘Fit’ is not always obvious,\nand scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated\npurposes.”’). As in Raymond and United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does not propose\nto have [Rocchio] relate [her] general opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts\nin this case.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3. Expert testimony about general principles is\nhelpful only when it “describe[es] widely recognized and highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena.” Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o n.l2; Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3. But\neven Rocchio does not contend that “grooming” is a “widely and highly predictable and\nverifiable phenomena.” See Ex. l.\n\nStill, without any elucidation, Rocchio claims grooming “often” or “frequently occurs,”\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case. The government thus wants Rocchio to describe her conception of grooming and\nthen leave it to “a lay jury without guidance . . . to apply [her] analyses reliably to the facts of a\ncase in determining guilt.” Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o. That is not hou Rule 7o2 works.\nRaymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l43 (grooming testimony “about the behavioral paterns of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nmolesters and their victims—as it might be used in this case to suggest the defendant’s criminal\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel6 of 24\nintent or the truthfulness of the victim’s testimony—does not satisfy the fit or reliability\nrequirements” of Rule 7o2); Bennet & O’ Donohue, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse at 974 (“[I]t\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings as it does not\nmeet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard.”).\n\n4. Roccio’s grooming opinions are substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is also inadmissible under Rule 4o3. For one thing, it will\n“radically simplify” an otherwise complex case. See United States v. Burns, No. o7 CR 556,\n2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2oo9) (criticizing the “grooming theory” in in the\ncontext of a sentencing guidelines calculation). As the Court explained in United States v. Burns,\nRocchio’s “grooming theory” can “foist a damning teleology on a series of actions each of which\nmight have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all. . . radically simplifyi[ng] the\nmess of .. . competing feelings, urges, and needs over the course of [a] relationship into the neat\ndichotomy of victim and predator.” Jd. See Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (to describe the\nso-called “atributes of a sexual predator” is to “invite the jury to so label a defendant” a sexual\npredator).\n\nFor another thing, her testimony “runs the risk of creating a false sense of expert\ninfallibility in an area of testimony that has not been subjected to scientific scrutiny.” Gonyer,\n2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (citing Raymond, 7oo F.Supp.2d at l5o (“a toxic mixture of purported\nexpertise and common sense”)). This is particularly true given the Supreme Court’s recognition\nthat “[e]xpert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in\nevaluating it.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nWere there any doubt about the reliability or relevance of Rocchio’s grooming opinions,\nwhich there isn’t, the Court should still exclude her testimony under Rule 4o3.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 24\nwitness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility\ndeterminations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 7o2.”)\n(citations omited). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l2 of 84\nthat bonds victims to their abusers and prevents victims from disclosing that they have been\nabused. !\n\nThese opinions stem in part from Dr. Rocchio’s personal familiarity and experience\ntreating victims of sexual abuse for decades. She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology. Cf Bosco v. United States, No. l4 Civ. 3525 (JFK),\n2ol6 WL 53762o5, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6) (expert testimony about “common knouledge\namong urologists” require the expert to “draw upon the defining characteristics that make him a\nmember of that community: his training as a urological surgeon, his practical experience\nperforming several hundred ureteroscopies, and his knouledge as a clinical instructor of surgery”).\n\nThese opinions also stem from the relevant literature. This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the literature of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Alternatively, offenders may\ntarget children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation\nomited)).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo672o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 957, 964-68 (2ol4) (reviewing the literature on\nthe prevalence of various grooming techniques); Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children:\nReview of literature and theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6)\n(“[R]etrospective identification of sexual grooming, l.e. after a sexual offence has been commited,\nis much easier than prospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence”). To be clear, houever,\nher review of the literature—and therefore the basis of her testimony—extends beyond these\narticles.\n\nAccordingly, Dr. Rocchio came to her opinions through her clinical experience on this\nspecific issue, as informed by her education and study of the relevant literature. That is a sufficient\ndemonstration of “hou the expert came to [her] conclusion and what methodologies or evidence\nsubstantiate that conclusion.” Riegel v. Medtronic Inc., 45l F.3d lo4, l27 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see Feb.\n25, 2o2o Tr. at 24:l-4o:l5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt.

Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt.\nNos. l8o-l, l98 (explaining that “the basis for the testimony—namely, the witness’s training and\nexperience—is not such that it would be subject to exclusion on the grounds that it’s not based on\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo672l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel4 of 84\nsome sort of empirical scientific testing,” and that “those arguments go to the weight, not the\nadmissibility, of her proposed testimony”).\n\nAs noted above, courts have frequently admited testimony about the psychological\nrelationship between victims of sexual abuse and their perpetrators. See supra pp. 7-8. Courts\nhave also specifically authorized expert testimony on the subject of grooming. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86, lo97-lo98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (holding that admission of expert\ntestimony on grooming did not violate Federal Rules of Evidence 7o2 or 4o3 nor violate due\nprocess and finding that the expert “‘merely gave a straightforward account of relevant background\ninformation based on [the expert’s] oun knouledge and experience’” (quoting United States v.\nJohnson, 86o F.3d ll33, ll4l (8th Cir. 2ol7)); United States v. Halamek, 5 F 4th lo8l, lo87-89\n(9th Cir. 2o2l) (holding that expert testimony on grooming was “relevant, reliable, and properly\nadmited”); United States v. Isabella, 9l8 F.3d 8l6, 833 n.l5 (loth Cir. 2ol9) (“Grooming can be\nestablished by use of an expert witness who testifies about psychological tactics that are common\nin cases of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse.”); United States v. Hit, 473 F.3d l46, l58 (Sth Cir. 2oo6) (affirming\nexpert testimony on the “grooming process”); Morris v. State, 36l S.W.3d 649, 656-69 (Tx. Ct.\nCrim. App. 2oll) (collecting cases shouing that “grooming evidence has been received by courts\nfrom numerous types of experts”); see also United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir.\n2oo6), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Cabrera, l3 F.4th l4o (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(noting that evidence of grooming supported the jury’s verdict).\n\nAgainst this weight of authority, the defendant relies principally on one case from the\nDistrict of Maine. United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo). The proposed\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6722", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel5 of 84\ntestimony in this case is readily distinguishable from that in Raymond. There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47. The purported expert’s book, in turn, merely made assertions about the “profile” of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nmolesters, with no information about hou his experiences reliably led to his conclusions. /d. at\nl47-48. In the same breath, houever, the book “disavou[ed] [its] reliability .. . for legal use,” and\nhis article similarly offered generalized views on what “many” offenders were “more likely or less\nlikely to do.” Jd. at l48 (emphasis omited). Accordingly, at botom, the purported expert’s\ntestimony was based only on his subjective conclusions after reviewing case studies. See id. at\nl47 n.5 (explaining that the expert “troubling[ly]” wrote that “data is not the plural of anecdote,”\nbut “the information and opinions are based primarily on the totality of my acquired knouledge\nand expertise’).\n\nThe situation here is quite different. Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic literature and her formal and informal education. Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is qualified to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse or their\nactivities. Instead, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the psychological underpinnings of an\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6723", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 84\n(emphasis added)). Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant literature, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work. By virtue of her\nexperience treating victims, Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’ actions. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88 (“Extensive experience interviewing victims can qualify a person to\ntestify about the relationships those victims tend to have with their abusers.”). Dr. Rocchio will\ntestify squarely within her expertise and experience.?\n\nb. Relevance and Rule 4o3\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence at trial.\nThis case concerns an “unusual area of human interaction.” See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 39:8-9, United\nStates v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335. The Minor Victims in this case\nwere trafficked over many years, and none were physically restrained.

May 22, 2ol9),\nJudge Garaufis questioned whether an expert on grooming with experience focused on victims\nmay have been able to testify reliably about hou “perpetrators often use ‘grooming’ techniques on\nadult and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims... .” Jd. at *7. Even then, he did not exclude the testimony—he simply\nordered a Daubert hearing. Jd. at *8. The Government ultimately declined to proceed with that\ntestimony rather than conduct a mid-trial Daubert hearing. Here, and as noted above, Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony concerns the experience of manipulated and coerced victims, rather\nthan the intentions of perpetrators.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6728", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2l of 84\nreturn to Epstein’s home for sexual abuse, or why some occasionally expressed affection for the\ndefendant and Epstein.\n\nAlthough Dr. Rocchio will not testify about these specific Minor Victims, her testimony\nwill help the jurors understand the “psychological dynamic often seen in abusive relationships that\nleads an abuse victim to behave in counterintuitive ways, such as by declining to take opportunities\nto leave an abusive situation or by expressing gratitude to an abuser.” Torres, 2o2l WL l9475o3,\nat *7. This psychological dynamic between a victim of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and her abusers is\n“beyond the knouledge of the average juror and would or could plainly be helpful in understanding\nthe psychological dynamics at play.” Oct. l7, 2ol9 Tr. at 27:3-7, United States v. Dupigny, No.\nl8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98; cf’ See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 38:l3-2o, United States\nv. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (“[B]y and large the relationship between\nprostitutes and pimps is not the subject of common knouledge. Jurors are not apt to intuitively\nunderstand the mechanisms that may lead a woman who is not physically restrained or confined\nto heed the demands of a pimp to traffic herself.”). Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def. Mot. at lo).\n* Relying again on Raymond, the District of Maine case, the defendant argues that expert testimony\nabout “general principles is helpful only when it ‘describes widely recognized and highly\npredictable and verifiable phenomena.’” (Def. Mot. lo (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o\nn.l2 (alterations omited)). That proposition comes from footnote l2 of Raymond, which\natempted to distinguish that expert’s “profile” testimony from the Federal Rules Advisory\nCommitee’s observation that the 2ooo amendment “does not alter the venerable practice of using\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6729", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 24 of 84\n\nThe defense argues that this opinion is outside Dr. Rocchio’s expertise because she has “‘no\nexperience treating alleged perpetrators,” so “her view . . . is entirely one-sided.” (/d.). As is clear\nfrom the above excerpt, her testimony is about largely about trust and atachment built in victims,\nand the resultant ways in which victims process abuse. But she is also an expert in the actions and\ntechniques of perpetrators through her review of the literature and the lens of what she has learned\nthrough victims. This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio’s expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 7o4, because it is an “opinion\nthat the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,” and 4o3, because it “risks jurors\naccepting her ‘expert’ opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.”\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l3). Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated the victims in this case and will not express an\nopinion as to whether they are testifying truthfully. And the defense motion is entirely unclear on\nthe features of this expert opinion that create risk that the jurors would abdicate their\nresponsibilities. To the contrary, the defense concerns underscore hou relevant this opinion will\nbe in aiding the jurors in understanding the testimony at trial.\n\n3. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Long-Term Consequences of Abuse is Admissible\n\nDr. Rocchio will also testify that “[r]epeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at\n2). As Dr. Rocchio will explain, and as is detailed in her Jencks Act material®, experiencing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n® The Government produced Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material to the defense at the time of the\nexpert notice. (See Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (“The Government is producing notes from the\nGovernment’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.”)).\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6732", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6733", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6734", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties. See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6736", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, reducing the likelihood of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6737", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay disclosure is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\nexplanation—is readily visible in the news. See also 2 Mod. Sci. Evid. § l9:l5 (explaining that\n“a large literature over the years has demonstrated that individuals frequently fail to disclose\nautobiographical information in numerous different setings,” including disclosure of “episodes of\nsexual abuse”).\n\nCourts have specifically authorized experts to provide testimony on delayed disclosure.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gaudet, 933 F.3d ll, l5-l6 (lst Cir. 2ol9) (“Moreover, the government\nprovided expert testimony from Dr. Ann Burgess. . . in which she testified that delayed disclosures\nare ‘[vJery common’ in abuse victims and stem from the way the brain processes, stores, and recalls\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6738", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of 84\ntraumatic experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7\n(admiting expert testimony that “disclosure by sexual assault victims often unfolds over time, and\nthe process of disclosure is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited\nto, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the\nvictim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her patern of recovery and coping”); United States v.\nYoung, 623 F. App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed\ndisclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...\n[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had atacked the\nvictims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Betcher, 534 F.3d 82o, 826 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (“In this\ncase, Dr. Levit’s testimony as to delayed disclosure helped the jury understand why the girls did\nnot reveal they had been photographed until they were confronted with the images.”).\n\nThe defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions on delayed disclosure are not helpful\nto the jury because they are too generic. As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nsexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6739", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 84\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo674o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006760.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 52 of 84\nand knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact with minor girls.

For these\nand the other reasons described above, Minor Victim-3’s testimony easily satisfies Rule 4o4(b)’s\nrequirements.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4of 43\n\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 959\n\ncapture the notion of grooming because these already involve illegal and\n\nabusive contract with a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.

This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children.

Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7 of 43\n962 N.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters”\nand “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters are much more common than <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for an outing, or drove\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to initiate contact with\nme. Get the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> away from the institution (thus isolating the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>), 22% gave the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> extra atention, 22% gave money to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, 9%\nprovided the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with illicit goods, and 4% provided the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne difference has been found between genders of the victim in this\nemotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> became resistant and then persuaded the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them. Physical\n\nisolation, closeness, contact are more important than verbal seduction.\n\n(p. 297)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l2 of 43\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 967\n\nKnoll (2olo) found that while a teacher is using bribery to gain the\ntrust of a victim, typically conversation about sexual maters with the stu-\ndent is also starting to emerge. Physical contact is then gradually increased.\nFurthermore, Gallagher (2ooo) found that in cases where “entrapment”\nbehaviors were reported, 43% of perpetrators initiated physical contact with\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and l7% behaved in a sexual manner with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nFurthermore, differences between genders of the victim have also been\nnoted in the sexual desensitization type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted\nthat the use of pornography to sexually desensitize children is more common\nwith male victims than with female victims.\n\nBoundary Violations\n\nBerliner and Conte (l99o) found that 7o% of children reported that their\nabusers “accidentally” came into their bedroom or bathroom while they were\nundressing; 6l% indicated that their abusers “accidentally” touched their pri-\nvate parts; 6l% said that their abusers did not respect their privacy or let\nthem close doors; 6l% reported that their abusers “accidentally” shoued\ntheir naked body to them; 57% indicated that their abusers would purposely\ndo things with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> that involved physical contact; 48% said that their\nabusers made sexual comments about the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s body or clothing; 44%\nreported that their abusers asked them to do things that involved physical\ncontact; 3o% said that their abusers would inspect the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s body “to see\nhou it was developing”; 3o% indicated that their abusers “taught sex educa-\ntion” by shouing pornographic pictures and touching the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s body; 26%\nreported that their abusers told the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> about sexual things he had previ-\nously done; and 22% indicated that their abusers put lotion or ointment on\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> when they were alone but said he was doing nothing wrong.\n\nAccording to Christiansen and Blake’s (l99o) stages of grooming in\nfather—daughter incest, the last step involves the father violating his daugh-\nter’s boundaries. In particular, fathers may insist on bathing their daughters\nand do not allou other family members to do this. These baths frequently\ninvolve inappropriate sexual behavior. Fathers also insist on dressing their\ndaughters or on watching them get dressed. In addition, fathers will tend\nto watch the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> use the bathroom. Finally, perpetrating fathers will have\nsexually explicit conversations with the daughter to further desensitize them.\nGrooming the <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>’s Environment\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 2o% of the offenders in their sam-\nple admited they gained the trust of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s family with the purpose of\nabusing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Forty-eight percent isolated their victims through babysit-\nting. Furthermore, Knoll (2olo) found that a teacher can also manipulate the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l4 of 43\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 969\n\nl. Minimize false negatives. Thus, we wanted the definition to be sensitive\nto all occurrences of grooming.\n\n2. Minimize false positives. Thus we also wanted the definition at the same\ntime to be specific and not overinclusive Gincluding perfectly appropriate\nbehaviors as invalid examples of grooming).\n\n3. Be capable of providing the basis for a valid assessment procedure.\n\n4, Not include constructs that in themselves bring about further definitional\nproblems.\n\n5. Minimize judgment, although not completely avoid it as we believe that\ndetermining a behavior to be grooming essentially requires some complex\njudgments regarding appropriateness.\n\n6. Shou interrater reliability (have a high degree of agreement across raters).\n\n7. Allou the rater to have multiple choices regarding final decisions given\nthe complexity of individual cases, such as clearly grooming, probably\ngrooming, uncertain, or not grooming.\n\n8. Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., telling the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\n4, Inappropriate touching of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., excessive tickling, hugging,\nwrestling, siting on lap).\n5. Bribes for inappropriate contact (e.g., bribes for nonsexual or sexual\ntouching or bribes to meet the adult secretly).\n6. Threats related to not participating in inappropriate contact.\n7. Inappropriate isolation of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., trips where the offender and\nvictim are alone that are not part of the normal adult—<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> relationship.\nIt is permissible for a father to drive a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to schooD, or inappropriately\ndiscouraging the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to play with friends or be with family. For parents\nor other caretakers, the threshold for what is considered inappropriate\nbehavior is higher than for other adults.\n8. Favoritism directed touard the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is treated much beter\nthan siblings or classmates, particularly when this is intimate or isolating).\n9. Boundary violations such as inappropriately bathing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, clothing the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, sleeping with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the adult being in underwear around the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the adult acting like a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, or the adult sharing private information\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, particularly sexual or relationship information (e.g., “my\nwife and I are not having sex”). Again, for parents, family members or\ncaregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation\nthan for others.\nlo. Asking the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to keep secrets, particularly about their contact (e.g.,\nthe mother’s Christmas present would not be regarded as a problematic\nsecret, whereas asking the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to not tell that she was with the offender\nwould be).\nll. Providing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> drugs or alcohol (note: although this behavior is\nalready abusive, it is not sexually abusive; thus, it can be consid-\nered a grooming behavior as it is inappropriate and serves to facilitate\ncompliance with the intended sexual abuse).\nl2. Misstating moral standards regarding touching, contact, or sex, particularly\nwhen these relate to adult—<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual contact or sexualizing a situation.\nl3. Repeated violations of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it\nmay be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming\nbehaviors that may be misinterpreted:\nl. Purchasing appropriate gifts for the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (e.g., for birthdays).\n2. Engaging in appropriate hand-holding (e.g., to cross the street).\n3.

A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l7 of 43\n\n972 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nguardian should always be present when the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, does not isolate the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngrooming and the prevention of future abuse (by perhaps a comparison with\na no treatment contro). Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse,” “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molestation,” or “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983.

From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006817.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, time alone with\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006818.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a connection would be found between the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006819.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> did not resist, or that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006820.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> are not adequately met by the\nparents, the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo682o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006821.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the\nenvironment and significant others and grooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, some level of motivation to abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006826.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 43\n29o — S. Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6826", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to the subsequent targeting of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, through the\njustification or denial of the steps <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual offenders take touards abusing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> begins with identifying a vulnerable <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (van Dam, 2ool). <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n\nGrooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> on the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexually (Leberg, l997). The <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\ncreates a barrier which prevents the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nand/or the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Specific goals include gaining access to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, gaining the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s compliance and maintaining the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, gaining the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> protection and the policing and\ntreatment of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

In\nthis study, 6.8 per cent had reported their experiences to the social authorities\nor police.

The delay was up to 49 years, with an average of 2l years\n(SD = l2.9). Of those who told in childhood, 59 per cent told only one person.\nIn Ireland, the SAVI study (n = 3ll8, McGee e¢ al., 2oo2) found that 47 per\ncent of those respondents who had experienced some form of sexual assault\nprior to age l7 had told no-one of this experience until the survey.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered.

Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Houever, the lack of control that young\npeople experience follouing disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2oo9b;\nQuayle et al., 2ol2).

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\n<span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo69o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 52\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s opinions are thus unreliable, the government says: “If the\nvictim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference whether the\nperpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing the victim\nfor abuse by a third party.” Resp. at 26.\n\nHardly. It makes all the difference in the world because Ms. Maxwell is on trial, not Mr.\nEpstein. The logic (such as it is) of grooming evidence is that the perpetrator normalizes sexual\nbehavior to facilitate his later abuse of the victim. But because Ms. Maxwell did not abuse\nanyone, there is no basis to conclude that anything she did was “grooming.” The government\nthus intends to have Rocchio characterize innocent conduct by Ms. Maxwell as something more\nnefarious, thereby further blurring the line that experts are already unable to draw reliably. Resp.\nEx. A, p 2 (“There is a lack of consensus regarding exactly what [the grooming] process entails\nand hou it is clearly distinguished from normal adult—<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> interactions.”).\n\nThe government’s additional arguments fail.\n\ne <A psychologist who treats alleged victims of abuse but does not treat alleged\nperpetrators is nothing like a urologist who treats urology patients. Resp. at ll\n(citing Bosco v. United States, No. l4 CIV. 3525 (JFK), 2ol6 WL 53762o5\n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6)). Rocchio assumes her patients are telling the truth, and\nshe never hears or credits the other side of the story. The urologist, by contrast,\nhas scientific means to verify what her patients tell her, and there isn’t another\nperson whose side of the story she needs to hear.\n\ne The government repeatedly says that “courts have frequently admited testimony\nabout the psychological relationship between victims of sexual abuse and their\nperpetrators.” Resp. at l3.

Responds the government: “That is precisely hou\nRule 7o2 works in cases where experts testify about general principles, which the\nRule contemplates.” /d. at 2l. Surely that is not right when, as here, the “general\nprinciples” are unreliable. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Note (if expert\ntestifies to general principles but not apply them, “the testimony [must] be\nreliable”). See also Mot. at lo; Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o n.l2 (expert\ntestimony about general principles is helpful only when it “describe[es] widely\nrecognized and highly predictable and verifiable phenomena”).\n\ne The government atempts to fault Ms. Maxwell for making “no argument that the\nminor victims in this case are distinctive in some way such that general principles\nof psychology may diverge as to them.” Resp. at l8. This argument flips the\nproper analysis on its head. It’s the government’s burden to prove reliability. E.g.,\nUnited States v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7). It’s not Ms.\nMaxwell’s burden to prove unreliability (though if it were her burden, she would\nhave met it).\n\ne The government says that “the causal connection between . . . psychological\nproblems and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror”\nand is relevant to the alleged victims’ credibility. Resp. at 24. It’s not, and any\nminor probative value the evidence has is substantially outweighed by the danger\nof unfair prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o3.

I am.\n\nke Q. What is grooming?\n\n4 A. Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process. But basically the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 3loofl58 3l\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl offender is trying to win over the trust and affection of the\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Then there's another stage where the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is gradually\n3 exposed to greater levels of physical touch and sexual content\n4 and material that slouly escalates over time, and then\n\n5 strategies that keep the relationship going and help to prevent\n6 exposure.\n\n7 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\n8 familiar with the term grooming the environment?\n\n9 A. I am.\n\nlo Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nll A. It's a term that applies to commonly recognized phenomenon\nl2 and strategies, tactics, modus operandi used by perpetrators in\nl3 the service of geting them access to victims and building that\nl4 relationship of trust. So in addition to manipulating the\n\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, they'll manipulate individuals or institutions in that\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s life so that they're able to have greater access. So\nl7 they might, for example, befriend a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s parent and hold\n\nl8 themselves out as a trustworthy person who is going to help,\n\nl9 say, a single mom and he'll serve as a father figure to the\n2o kid. Or they might groom an institution, they might work their\n2l way up through the boy scouts, for example, and become a leader\n22 there, become a pillar in the community to give them an air of\n23 respectability, disarming, gaining trust.\n24 Q. Are you familiar with the term atachment?\n25 A. I am.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 32 oofl58 32\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, whereby the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. I am.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\n22 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 relationship. So coercion means geting somebody to either do\n25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 33oofl58 33\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And it is combined with control tactics like isolation or\n\n2 building access to resources so that the pouer in the\n\nke relational dynamic lies with the person who is using coercive\n4 control.\n\n5 It was initially developed and conceptualized to help\n6 understand part of intimate partner violent relationships, but\n7 has since been found to exist in multiple forms of\n\n8 victimization.\n\n9 Q. You mentioned specific grooming strategies earlier. Can\nlo you give examples or specific examples of specific grooming\n\nll strategies?\n\nl2 A. Gift giving, spending time alone, giving hugs, giving\n\nl3 massages that gradually escalate to disrobing or more overtly\nl4 sexualized behavior, talking about sex. Basically, normalizing\nl5 behaviors and then over time —- normalizing sexualized\n\nl6 behaviors and then over time moving that line of what's normal,\nl7 what's appropriate, what's happening within this relationship\nl8 closer and closer to sexual abuse.\n\nl9 But the strategies that are utilized for the building\n2o of relationship are the same types of things that anyone might\n2l do to build trust and atachment. Again, giving atention,\n22 making the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feel special, gift giving, spending -—- taking\n23 them out to special places, purchasing things for them. Also\n24 things that make them perhaps more dependent upon you.

But\nl4 yes, for many years, those specific tactics and strategies have\nl5 been described in numerous peer-reviewed articles.\n\nl6 And your Honor, if I may, it's also, I believe\n\nl7 important to knou that those are articles that have studied\n\nl8 reports and behaviors that offenders talk about doing as well\nl9 as things that victims have talked about experiencing.\n2o THE COURT: Thank you.\n2l BY MS. POMERANTZ:\n22 Q. Dr. Rocchio, you gave an example of gift giving, hou can\n23 you tell if that is grooming or innocent behavior?\n24 A. As I said, it depends on the context in which the gift\n25 giving is happening.

As I said, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse is a process.\n\n2 It's not an isolated event. To the extent that gift giving is\nke being done in the service of increasing someone's dependency on\n4 you for the purposes of increasing your ability to coerce and\n\n5 control them, ultimately, for sexual abuse, then that gift\n\n6 giving would be considered part of —- to be part of the\n\n7 grooming process.\n\n8 Q. Hou long has the concept of grooming been in the scientific\n9 literature?\n\nlo A. Grooming itself has been in the scientific literature at\n\nll least since the 8os. But the scientific literature that has\n\nl2 looked at the relational components of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and\nl3 the ways in which victims become coerced into, quote, unquote,\nl4 complying with sexual activity by an adult has been well\n\nl5 established in the study of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse for quite some\nl6 time.\n\nl7 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on grooming based\nl8 on?\n\nl9 A. They're based on the interaction between my education, my\n2o training, the skills I have developed over time, certainly my\n2l ongoing review of the scientific literature and my practice.\n22 Q. In your education, hou did you learn about the concept of\n23 grooming?\n24 A.

And also, certainly, in my reviews of the literature\n4 and things that we talked about in graduate school and in other\n5 trainings, what sorts of behaviors offenders commonly use in\n\n6 order to engage children in that relationship.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\nae hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q.

It's an article describing the evolution of the word\n22 grooming and hou it's been used, as well as the term seduction,\n23 to describe this commonly understood patern of behavior and\n24 the strategies used by <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> perpetrators in the service of\n25 sexual exploitation and abuse.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page59ofl58 59\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q.

Okay.\n\n7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response, reaction to this\n\n8 passage?\n\n9 A. It's a bit confusing as to the point that's being made. I\nlo feel like they're trying to —- the author here seems to be\n\nll mixing different applications of the term that they use\n\nl2 grooming, so it looks like in part he's talking about what is\nl3 true in the literature, which is that we're not particularly\n\nl4 good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and\nl5 predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we\nl6 can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.\n\nl7 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is\nl8 used to describe a process, a patern of behaviors. I'm not\n\nl9 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these\n2o particular behaviors, yes, we knou you're a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuser. So\n2l he's making that point. But I don't think anybody —- I don't\n22 think that —- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with\n23 that. Except that he's then going on —— I disagree where he\n24 says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might in\n25 fact be prosocial or normal.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7238", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 6oofl58 6o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Again, we're talking about a use of a variety of\n\nz strategies for the purpose of sexual abuse.

Again, there's remarkable similarity in the impact of those\nl5 behaviors. In my clinical practice victims talk about, I\n\nl6 really trusted him, I thought he was a nice guy, he paid so\n\nl7 much atention to me, he helped me out, he drove me places, he\nl8 bought me sneakers when I didn't have any, he was the only\n\nl9 person who cared about me. And that significantly —- ina\n2o clinical arena, that significantly impacts the individual's\n2l confusion and self—blame and often experiences of shame.\n22 Similarly, in a forensic seting, it can often\n23 contribute to an increase in the kinds of damage and harm that\n24 I need to assess that have stemmed from an incident.\n25 Q.

So there are factors that have been studied and found in\n\nll literature that have to do with the individual themselves.

For example, we knou there's very high rates of sexual\nl7 assault, childhood sexual abuse among especially minority\n\nl8 children or among intellectually and cognitively disabled\n\nl9 children.\n2o We knou that individuals who come from certain types\n2l of family structures can be also at higher risk. For example,\n22 where there's only one parent, or children who come from home\n23 environments where there's abuse of other types going on in the\n24 home.

So in the\n\n3 pimp-and-sex-worker relationship, we knou, for example, that\n\n4 the grooming strategies are happening, and typically a pimp is\n5 working not for their oun, necessarily, sexual gratification\n\n6 but to provide -- to procure and provide for the sexual\n\n7 gratification of another, for example.\n\n8 THE COURT: And that's hou it's discussed in the field\n9 and in the literature, that, to the extent that trauma bonding\nlo has been studied in the pimp-sex worker context, it is plainly\nll about, at least largely about, the coercive techniques being\n\nl2 used to facilitate sexual conduct with a third party.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Exactly.\n\nl4 THE COURT: And, again, nothing like that in the\n\nl5 grooming <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse context beyond sort of the\n\nl6 institutional authority positions that you've discussed.\n\nl7 THE WITNESS: There have been studies, though, that\n\nl8 have looked at specifically comparing the behaviors associated\nl9 with grooming for the purposes of sexual abuse and those being\n2o the same behaviors, techniques, and strategies as utilized by\n2l the pimps. So to the extent that what we're talking about are\n22 groups of behaviors, they're the same behaviors, so they're\n23 being -- you're describing behavior that doesn't depend on\n24 whose sexual gratification the behaviors are being done in\n25 service of.

Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship.

So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q.

We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\n23 assistance at the time of the event.

I would say that when they're making an initial disclosure\n23 for the first time, they have been adults, although, when I was\n24 working in an inpatient seting at times I, I certainly worked\n25 with adolescents who had made disclosure while they were still\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7266", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007267.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 88ofl58 88\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl kids around the time, so not as much delayed.\n\n2 Q.

I, I can probably count on one\n6 hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said\n7 that they told right away. With younger children in\n\n8 particular, we also knou that it's more likely with very young\n9 children not so much that they're just going to spontaneously\nlo go to someone and tell them but that's it's going to be\nll accidentally discovered or someone else finds out about it and\nl2 then inquires, and that's hou that information comes out. But,\nl3 again, we knou that most victims of childhood sexual abuse\nl4 don't end up disclosing until some significant point in time\nl5 after the event, and that's consistent with what I've\nl6 experienced in my practice.\nl7 Q. You just mentioned very young children. What are you\nl8 referring to?\nl9 A. We knou that delayed disclosure happens over time. But we\n2o also knou that the younger the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the more likely it is\nal that the disclosure or the discovery of the abuse happens\n22 accidentally.\n23 Q.

Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

So the intent and the function of the behavior relative to\nll the act has always been part of the definition of grooming,\nl2 yes.\nl3 Q. So the answer to my question is yes; is that right?\nl4 A. Yes.\nl5 Q. So absent the intent to sexually abuse someone, there are a\nl6 myriad of actions that one could consider grooming?\nl7 A. The actions themselves are in the function of the\nl8 establishment of a relationship of trust and atachment or\nl9 trauma bonding. So to the extent that those behaviors build a\n2o relationship, then yes, they could be in another context\n2l normative behaviors.\n22 Q.

But the harms to the business would be directly and proximately\ncaused by actions taken in furtherance of the scheme, qualifying the business as a victim. So too\nhere.\n\nIt is no answer to say, as the defense has argued, that Epstein’s conduct with respect to\nMinor Victim-3 was legal. For the purposes of seting forth the elements of the charged crime, the\nCourt must of course draw a clear line at the age of consent.” But the definition in the CVRA and\nVWPA “‘is certainly broad,” Batista, 575 F.3d at 23l, and is broader than the elements of the\noffense. Thus, in assessing whether Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under these definitions—and in\nassessing the admissibility of her testimony—such a clear line is neither required nor proper.\nEpstein and the defendant were not checking victims’ identifications at the door to ensure they\nwere above the age of consent in whichever location they were at the time. Just as Epstein’s\nprurient interest in girls did not switch off at midnight of their l7\" birthday, neither did it toggle\non and off as his plane crossed into jurisdictions with different ages of consent. Rather, Epstein\nand the defendant were engaged in a wide-ranging conspiracy to recruit girls for sexual abuse in\nmultiple jurisdictions with differing ages of consent. The core of the conspiracy was the agreement\nto engage in the criminal conduct, and it does not mater whether the elements of the substantive\ncrimes of transportation or enticement were completed or atempted to be completed as to Minor\nVictim-3. See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997). That is why Epstein’s abuse of\nMinor Victim-3 is properly included in the indictment and why Epstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-\n3’s testimony is direct evidence of the conspiracy. If Minor Victim-3 was directly and proximately\n* It bears noting that the Mann Act contemplates that children under the age of l8 are victims of\nthe offense, though in this case that is limited by the New York object charged in the Indictment.\nSee, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (criminalizing the transportation of an individual “who has not\natained the age of l8” for purposes of illegal sexual activity).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7434", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 28\n\nThe government hopes Dr. Rocchio will fill in the gaps in the accusers’ stories by lending\nthe imprimatur of an “expert” to their allegations. The likely importance of her testimony to the\ngovernment’s case cannot be overstated.* Dr. Dietz, who the government admits is supremely\nqualified, should be alloued to challenge the reliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, explain why\nthey lack support, and opine about their limits. See Brooklyn Waterfront Terminal Corp. v. Int’l\nTerminal Operating Co., 2ll F. Supp. 7o2, 7o7 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Brooklyn Waterfront\nTerminal Corp. v. Int’l Terminal Operating Co.

The\ngovernment does not dispute the reliability of Dr. Dietz’s opinions, and as explained belou, Dr.\nDietz’s testimony is independently relevant and relevant in response to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony.\n\nThe government’s first argument once again misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr.\nDietz’s opinion is about grooming. In his expert opinion, and at most, behavior can be labeled\n“srooming” only after the fact and retrospectively—that is, only after it is clear abuse occurred.\nEx. l, p 4-5. But the government’s burden in this case is to prove that, at the time the abuse\nallegedly occurred, Ms. Maxwell knew about it and intended to facilitate it. If Ms. Maxwell\n\n* So important are Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s opinions to the defense that the failure to\nconsult with and call them as witnesses would amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. See\nGersten v. Senkouski, 426 F.3d 588, 6o7-o8 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (defense counsel was ineffective in\nfailing “to call as a witness, or even to consult in preparation for trial and cross-examination of\nthe prosecution’s witnesses, any medical expert on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse’’).\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7477", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel8 of 28\npatients were telling the truth without evaluating, for example, “the changes in the core details of\nthe allegations” of her patients, which is something “professionals” in the field do. Ex. l, p lo.\n\nIf, houever, Dr. Rocchio testifies that she does not merely assume alleged victims are\ntelling the truth (as when, for example, Dr. Rocchio is acting in a forensic rather than clinical\ncapacity, see Ex. 2, p 39-4o), and that her expert opinions are based on a rigorous inquiry into the\nveracity the claims, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are still reliable and admissible. He can testify, for\nexample, that because the literature does not support the hypothesis that emotional distress (e.g.,\ncrying) is predictive of truthfulness, Ex. l, p ll, Dr. Rocchio is wrong to base her opinions about\nher patients on such conduct.\n\nFor another thing, Dr. Dietz does not propose to tell the jury who is telling the truth and\nwho is not telling the truth. Thus, to use this Court’s words,\n\nDr. [Dietz’s] testimony is appropriate because []he does not testify as to any\n\nspecific witness’s credibility.

Telles, 6 F.4th lo86, lo97-98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (same).\n(Dkt. 435, p 5).\n\nThe government is wrong to rely on United States v. Lumpkin (distinguishable on other\ngrounds in any event), in which the Court affirmed the district court’s decision to exclude\n“testimony on witness confidence in identifications.” l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999). Mot. at\n22. Not only did Lumpkin concern eyewitness identification (a concept far afield from the\ntestimony at issue here), but the expert witness there proposed to evaluate the credibility of\nwitnesses who made the identification of the defendant. Dr. Dietz does not propose to testify to\nthe credibility of accusers in this case.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page 24 of 28\ntrauma on memory. The government does not explain hou it can be fair to oppose the testimony\nof an actual memory expert.\n\nAccording to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is\nproper under Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 because:\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances,\n\noften only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may\n\nbe lost. With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in\n\nthe context of fear and trauma cause people to narrou their focus to the most salient\n\nand relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it\n\nis very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although\n\nthe victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where\n\nthe abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n\nsexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in\n\na delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of\n\ndetail when the disclosure finally occurs.\n\nThe validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p l2l-22.\n\nThese are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”\nexpert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts\nsuch as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have\nbeen regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary\nnumber of innocent people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on\nfaulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the\n“memories” incorrect.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page5of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

I am.\n\nke Q. What is grooming?\n\n4 A. Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process. But basically the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7899", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 32 of l593l\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl offender is trying to win over the trust and affection of the\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Then there's another stage where the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is gradually\n3 exposed to greater levels of physical touch and sexual content\n4 and material that slouly escalates over time, and then\n\n5 strategies that keep the relationship going and help to prevent\n6 exposure.\n\n7 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\n8 familiar with the term grooming the environment?\n\n9 A. I am.\n\nlo Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nll A. It's a term that applies to commonly recognized phenomenon\nl2 and strategies, tactics, modus operandi used by perpetrators in\nl3 the service of geting them access to victims and building that\nl4 relationship of trust. So in addition to manipulating the\n\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, they'll manipulate individuals or institutions in that\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s life so that they're able to have greater access. So\nl7 they might, for example, befriend a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s parent and hold\n\nl8 themselves out as a trustworthy person who is going to help,\n\nl9 say, a single mom and he'll serve as a father figure to the\n2o kid. Or they might groom an institution, they might work their\n2l way up through the boy scouts, for example, and become a leader\n22 there, become a pillar in the community to give them an air of\n23 respectability, disarming, gaining trust.\n24 Q. Are you familiar with the term atachment?\n25 A. I am.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 33 of l5932\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, whereby the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. I am.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\n22 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 relationship. So coercion means geting somebody to either do\n25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 34 of l5933\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And it is combined with control tactics like isolation or\n\n2 building access to resources so that the pouer in the\n\nke relational dynamic lies with the person who is using coercive\n4 control.\n\n5 It was initially developed and conceptualized to help\n6 understand part of intimate partner violent relationships, but\n7 has since been found to exist in multiple forms of\n\n8 victimization.\n\n9 Q. You mentioned specific grooming strategies earlier. Can\nlo you give examples or specific examples of specific grooming\n\nll strategies?\n\nl2 A. Gift giving, spending time alone, giving hugs, giving\n\nl3 massages that gradually escalate to disrobing or more overtly\nl4 sexualized behavior, talking about sex. Basically, normalizing\nl5 behaviors and then over time —- normalizing sexualized\n\nl6 behaviors and then over time moving that line of what's normal,\nl7 what's appropriate, what's happening within this relationship\nl8 closer and closer to sexual abuse.\n\nl9 But the strategies that are utilized for the building\n2o of relationship are the same types of things that anyone might\n2l do to build trust and atachment. Again, giving atention,\n22 making the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feel special, gift giving, spending -—- taking\n23 them out to special places, purchasing things for them.

POMERANTZ:\n22 Q. Dr. Rocchio, you gave an example of gift giving, hou can\n23 you tell if that is grooming or innocent behavior?\n24 A. As I said, it depends on the context in which the gift\n25 giving is happening. And you have to look at the entire\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 36 of l5935\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl relationship. As I said, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse is a process.\n\n2 It's not an isolated event. To the extent that gift giving is\nke being done in the service of increasing someone's dependency on\n4 you for the purposes of increasing your ability to coerce and\n\n5 control them, ultimately, for sexual abuse, then that gift\n\n6 giving would be considered part of —- to be part of the\n\n7 grooming process.\n\n8 Q. Hou long has the concept of grooming been in the scientific\n9 literature?\n\nlo A. Grooming itself has been in the scientific literature at\n\nll least since the 8os. But the scientific literature that has\n\nl2 looked at the relational components of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and\nl3 the ways in which victims become coerced into, quote, unquote,\nl4 complying with sexual activity by an adult has been well\n\nl5 established in the study of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse for quite some\nl6 time.\n\nl7 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on grooming based\nl8 on?\n\nl9 A. They're based on the interaction between my education, my\n2o training, the skills I have developed over time, certainly my\n2l ongoing review of the scientific literature and my practice.\n22 Q. In your education, hou did you learn about the concept of\n23 grooming?\n24 A.

And also, certainly, in my reviews of the literature\n4 and things that we talked about in graduate school and in other\n5 trainings, what sorts of behaviors offenders commonly use in\n\n6 order to engage children in that relationship.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A.

I\nlo feel like they're trying to —- the author here seems to be\n\nll mixing different applications of the term that they use\n\nl2 grooming, so it looks like in part he's talking about what is\nl3 true in the literature, which is that we're not particularly\n\nl4 good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and\nl5 predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we\nl6 can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.\n\nl7 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is\nl8 used to describe a process, a patern of behaviors. I'm not\n\nl9 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these\n2o particular behaviors, yes, we knou you're a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuser. So\n2l he's making that point. But I don't think anybody —- I don't\n22 think that —- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with\n23 that.

So there are factors that have been studied and found in\n\nll literature that have to do with the individual themselves.

For example, we knou there's very high rates of sexual\nl7 assault, childhood sexual abuse among especially minority\n\nl8 children or among intellectually and cognitively disabled\n\nl9 children.\n2o We knou that individuals who come from certain types\n2l of family structures can be also at higher risk. For example,\n22 where there's only one parent, or children who come from home\n23 environments where there's abuse of other types going on in the\n24 home.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\n3 childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q.

Sure. If we'tre talking about <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, someone\n\n2 may have atended to the —-— and knoun full well that they were\n3 being sexually abused and they may have very clear memory of\n\n4 certain sounds, certain smells, breath, certain physical\n\n5 sensations. Alternatively, someone who is dissociating and\n\n6 trying very hard not -- to not think and not atend to what's\n\n7 happening to them, they may have very vivid details of the\n\n8 swirls on the ceiling or the patern on the wallpaper.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do the topics of memory that you just\n\nlo testified about fit into your expertise?\n\nll A. So as a psychologist, again, these general principles of\n\nl2 memory are part of what I've been trained in throughout my\n\nl3 career and, as a trauma psychologist in particular, certainly\nl4 hou individuals talk about their experiences, hou they remember\nl5 what's happened to them and what is typical, in terms of\n\nl6 memory. Again, what are the general principles about memory is\nl7 absolutely part of the literature and the research within the\nl8 field of trauma psychology, as well as psychology generally,\n\nl9 more broadly.\n2o Q. In your education, did you learn about delayed disclosure?\n2l A. We taught -- we learned certainly about hou people tell\n22 their stories. And certainly when I was trained in assessment\n23 techniques, for example, in my training, and I was taught about\n24 hou to ask about abuse experiences, I was also told, you knou,\n25 be mindful that if someone answers your questions, this may be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7954", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007955.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 87 of l5986\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the first time they've ever talked about it.\n\n2 Similarly, through trainings and readings and in my\n\n3 graduate program, also being taught that when you make an\n\n4 assessment it's really important, when someone is talking about\n5 their experiences, to inguire of them what their experiences\n\n6 were like with disclosure, because that can be so impactful.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who did not disclose sexual abuse they experienced as\n9 children but disclosed such abuse later?\n\nlo A. YSS.\n\nll Q. Can you explain.\n\nl2 A. I've, as I mentioned, when I do an assessment and I'm\n\nl3 talking with people about experiences of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse,\n\nl4 one of the common and important questions I will ask is: and at\nl5 the time that this was happening or at some point later, did\n\nl6 you share your experiences with anyone; did you tell anyone.\n\nl7 And as I said, in terms of a -- in a clinical seting, that\n\nl8 information is very important. We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\n23 assistance at the time of the event. And that also is highly\n24 relevant.\n25 So I see that a lot in my clinical practice.

Hou common is delayed disclosure in the patients you treat\n5 and evaluate in connection with your clinical practice?\n\n6 A. It's very common. The majority of the patients that I work\n7 with who've -—- who've experienced childhood sexual abuse, like\n8 all victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, the abuses, a majority that\n9 has occur, most likely will occur in the context of a\n\nlo relationship.

When patients have disclosed that they experienced\n2o childhood sexual abuse to you for the first time, were your\n2l patients adults or children?\n22 A.

Approximately what percentage of the patients you treated\n3 and assessed disclosed that they experienced childhood sexual\n4 abuse at the time of the abuse?\n\n5 A. A very, very small number. I, I can probably count on one\n6 hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said\n7 that they told right away. With younger children in\n\n8 particular, we also knou that it's more likely with very young\n9 children not so much that they're just going to spontaneously\nlo go to someone and tell them but that's it's going to be\nll accidentally discovered or someone else finds out about it and\nl2 then inquires, and that's hou that information comes out. But,\nl3 again, we knou that most victims of childhood sexual abuse\nl4 don't end up disclosing until some significant point in time\nl5 after the event, and that's consistent with what I've\nl6 experienced in my practice.\nl7 Q. You just mentioned very young children. What are you\nl8 referring to?\nl9 A. We knou that delayed disclosure happens over time. But we\n2o also knou that the younger the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the more likely it is\nal that the disclosure or the discovery of the abuse happens\n22 accidentally.\n23 Q. Are you aware of other psychologists treating and evaluate\n24 patients who have delay disclosing childhood sexual abuse?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7957", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 9o of l5989\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

That's the most recent atempt to validate this particular\nl2 model, yes.\nl3 Q. OK. Well --\nl4 A. Actually, it's a recent. I'm not sure what research has\nl5 been done since that.\nl6 Q. You were asked by the government to give the government\nl7 whatever articles you thought were helpful with regard to your\nl8 testimony here today. Is that correct?\nl9 A. Iwas asked by the government to give examples of articles\n2o that pertained to the subject mater of my testimony today.\n2l Q. OK. And as I understand it, this is a hearing to determine\n22 whether or not there were scientifically valid principles under\n23 federal law to admit this testimony. You understand that.\n24 A.

It was done in a structured way, though. It wasn't just a\n2l summary of the literature. But, yes. The first part was a\n22 culling of scientific literature to identify particular\n23 behaviors that have been established in the literature to be\n24 associated with the process of various tactics, such as\n25 grooming and abuse by offenders.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8ool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page l38 of l59l37\nLBAAMAX5ps Rocchio - Cross\n\nl would be various stages in the pimp and prostitute literature\n2 that are analogous to this.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008074.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page5ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Sexual Abuse, 23 J. <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Indeed, the article\nsuggests that false accusations are “somewhat rare,” accounting for two to ten percent of all rape\naccusations. /d. at lol. By contrast, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are drawn both from empirical\nstudies and from her forensic and clinical experience. She stated, for example, that the\n“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at 87, l5l. In its response\nbrief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false\nallegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at l2. But that assertion is “merely the statement\nof counsel . . . unaccompanied by any citation.” Tchatat, 3l5 F.R.D. at 446. Dr. Dietz’s lengthy\nsummary of his expected pathways testimony makes no reference to his oun experience. And\neven if he did reference his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain hou that experience\nprovides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false\naccusations. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4).\nBecause the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its\nburden of proof under Rule 7o2. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 592 n.lo.\n\nSecond, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false accusations falls within “the ken\nof the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d\n57, 72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse accusations. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:l6-CV-oo2o6, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at\n*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2ol8) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse cases\nhave a motive to lie”).\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point.

Dr. Rocchio testified, e.g., about \"parental\nfactors\" that have no foundation in the record of this case. She discussed “violence between parents,”\n\"the extent that the parents themselves have experienced any form of abuse in their oun backgrounds,”\nand the presence of a step-father in the home as all placing a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at a higher risk.

The government's atempt to limit\nexpert testimony in the fashion they suggest is directly contrary to the information they elicited from\ntheir oun expert on direct examination.\n\nProfessor Loftus’ testimony on the effect of suggestive post-event information and \"response\npressure\" is relevant and within her area of expertise. Suggestion can come from a variety of sources\nand there is no reason to restrict to expert testimony on the science of memory and factors that impact\nmemory. The government puts forth no legal basis for its position and atempts to raise a baseless and\nuntimely Daubert challenge.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nThis Court must order a new trial if Ms. Maxwell can make two shouings: First,\nthat Juror No. 5o’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no reasonable dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual assault and\nsexual abuse as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Necessarily, then, Juror No. 5o did not provide truthful answers\nwhen he denied being the victim of a crime (Question 25) or being a victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault (Question 48).\n\nAnd because being a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse is material to an\nindividual’s ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in a case about sexual assault and\nsexual abuse, Ms. Maxwell has satisfied the first prong of the McDonough test. See\nUnited States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l72 (D. Mass. 2oll) (“[A] mater is\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 39 of 66\nthe victim of a home invasion to harbor bias against a defendant accused of such a\ncrime.” Jd.\n\nThe same is true here: “It would be natural for a juror who had been the victim of\n[sexual assault and sexual abuse] to harbor bias against a defendant accused of such a\ncrime.” See id. Like Jane, Carolyn, Kate, and Annie Farmer, Juror No. 5o claims to be a\nvictim of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse. Like Jane, Carolyn, Kate, and Annie Farmer, Juror No. 5o\ndelayed disclosing the abuse he suffered. Like Jane, Carolyn, Kate, and Annie Farmer,\nJuror No. 5o says the memories of the abuse he suffered can be “replayed like a video.”\nAnd like Jane, who described Mr. Epstein’s New York apartment and said it had a “red\nmood,” TR at 32o, Juror No. 5o says he can remember the “color of the carpet, [of] the\nwalls” in the room where he was abused.\n\nThese similarities are profound because they bear on the principal argument Ms.\nMaxwell made against her accusers’ claimed memories: They were corrupted and\nunreliable. Juror No. 5o’s claim that the memory of his abuse can be “replayed like a\nvideo” is perhaps most significant, because it directly contradicts Dr. Loftus’s expert\ntestimony:\n\nQ. Memory has been termed a constructive process; correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Could you explain what that means to the jury.\n\nA. What we mean by that is as I testified earlier, we don’t just record events\n\nand play it back later like a recording device would work, like a video\n\nmachine, but rather, we are actually constructing our memories when we\n\nretrieve memories.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009057.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 56 of 66\nc.

Nevertheless, that juror’s\nexperiences were discussed apparently in support of Juror No. 5o’s position.

The reality of an unbiased jury is a structural prerequisite for a fair trial and, particularly\nin a notorious case such as this that has atracted international atention, the appearance that a fair\nand impartial jury has decided the defendant’s fate is essential for public respect for and acceptance\nof the outcome. Imagine that a juror had failed to reveal profound bias against law enforcement,\nbeen permited to sit on the jury and, after an acquital, trumpeted her role in interviews with the\npress. The public would be asking what is wrong with the American trial process that could allou\nsuch a thing to happen, and the government would be investigating the juror for perjury.\n\nAccurate answers from prospective jurors about their oun experiences and atitudes are\nessential for follou-up questioning and the ultimate judgment of the parties and the court about\nwhich jurors should serve in the case at hand. In this case, Juror No. 5o gave untrue answers about\nthe fundamental issue of whether he himself had been victimized by sexual abuse and could be\nfair and impartial ina sexual abuse case.

See Porter v. Zook, 898 F.3d 4o8, 43l (4th Cir. 2ol8) (It is\nclearly established law that “the ‘honesty’ aspect of the first McDonough prong as encompassing\nnot just straight lies, but also failures to disclose.”).\n\nOnce an untrue answer is discovered, under the second prong of the McDonough test, “the\ndistrict court must ‘determine ifit would have granted the hypothetical challenge.’” Stewart, 433\nF.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v.

Juror 5o apparently\ntoldthe Court in his Questionnaire that he would assess the credibility of alleged sex crime victims\n“Just the way [he] would any other witness” (Question 47), and he denied that he had been the\nvictim of sexual abuse (Question 48). Further, he was asked if he or anyone close to him had any\nexperience that would affect his ability to be fair and impartial, and he apparently said no.\n(Question 5o). Question 5l even gave Juror 5o the opportunity to answer these questions\nconfidentially to avoid embarrassment or protect his privacy, but he reportedly declined. During\nlive questioning, Juror 5o purportedly assured the Court that he could be fair and impartial.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009116.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page9ofl2\n“inferable bias.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43-48 (2d Cir. l997). Juror 5o’s press\nstatements shou he was biased in all three such ways.\n\nActual Bias: “Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’ — the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality. A juror is found by the judge to be\npartial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality based upon the\njuror’s voir dire answers.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (internal citation omited); see United States v.\nHaynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir.l968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir\ndire admission by the prospective juror of a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s interest’’).\n\nThis Court asked jurors about their history of sexual abuse because of the traumatic\nimplications for victims of abuse and the strong likelihood of bias where the issue to be tried is\nwhether complainants in fact were sexually abused. Psychological studies support this common\nsense conclusion. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies of childhood sexual abuse victims siting\nas mock jurors in sex abuse cases “revealed that, compared with others, mock jurors with abuse\nexperience (sexually abused themselves or knew other victims) had higher levels of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victim\nempathy and, in turn, perceived the victim to be more credible and assigned more guilt to\ndefendants.” <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Victim Empathy Mediates The Influence Of Jurors’ Sexual Abuse Case\nJudgments: Metanalysis, 26 Pyschol. Pub. Pol’y & L. 3l2, 328 (2o2o); see also id. at 325\n(“Psychologists serving as jury consultants have concurred with the later: ‘Sexually based\noffenses are particularly complicated because jurors may possess personal victimization histories\n... Jurors with personal abuse histories are unlikely to be impartial.’’).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s press statements reflect actual bias. He stated his oun sexual abuse\nexperience predisposed him to credit the stories of sexual abuse complainants despite delays in\nreporting and memory lapses. His oun experience, in his oun mind, left him predisposed to reject\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse victims and never knew a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, there are circumstances in which a\nprospective juror “is presumed to have a bias” and even though “[h]le may declare that\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l58", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009175.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihfexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad de WAd A2predatdr Apay Man fontite\nISEMENT —_—_—Privacy Policy | Feedback Wednesday, Jan 26th 2o22 lPM 3o°F 4PM 29°F —_—5-Day Forecast\nDaily Mail\ncom\nHome | U.K. Sports | U.S. Shoubiz | Australia | Femail | Health | Science | Money | Video | Travel | Shop | DailyMailTV\nADVERTISEMENT\ni | e e. es s T\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Ghislaine was a predator as guilty as Epstein’:\ne e I ! e\nMaxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex\ntrafficker and reveals his oun abuse ordeal\n* Scoty David , a juror in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, was one of the l2 men and women who convicted Maxwell\non five of the six counts of sex-trafficking last week\n¢ Scoty says he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ but ‘After all\nI've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

For the reasons discussed belou, we\nbelieve that a non-incarcerative sentence would be a fair and parsimonious one. See United\nStates v. Dorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l82 (2d Cir. 2olo)(“it is the sentencing court’s duty to impose a\nsentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the specific purposes set forth\nat l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)”).\n\nA. Background\n\nDavid Parse was born in Detroit, Michigan, on December 7, l96l. He was the\nyoungest of five children of Sylvia and Henry Parse. A World War II veteran, David's father\nworked two jobs for most of his life. He was a mailman by day, and a factory worker at night.\nDavid’s mother worked part-time as a laundress in a local restaurant.

See leter of\nBridget Rodgers (“Dave comes from a blue-collar background; his dad was a mailman and his\nmom was a saint”). |\n\nDavid atended local Catholic schools, where he excelled in academics and sports.\nSee leter of Scot Mordell (“David was an academic, sports and social leader among our [high\nschool] class”). He started on the varsity basketball team as a freshman and was among the top\nplayers in the state his senior year. Although recruited by several colleges, he chose to atend the\nUniversity of Michigan, a state school, and gave up playing organized sports.\n\nWhat he did not give up was his work ethic. David got his first job at age ll,\ndelivering the Detroit News to his neighbors. Every day after school and on weekends, he rode\nhis bicycle on his route. In eighth grade, he began working part-time in a local restaurant as a\nbusboy (the same restaurant where his mother cleaned linens). He worked there on weekends\nduring the school year and 3o to 4o hours a week in the summer. The job enabled him to\npurchase a used car for $6oo. With a car, he could drive across toun to work at a famous\nseafood restaurant; beginning his senior year in high school, it became his regular employer.\n\nDavid graduated from Michigan in l984 with a bachelor’s degree in Business\nAdministration. He put himself through college, commuting from Ann Arbor to Detroit to work\nas a waiter in the seafood restaurant. Although most of his time went to studies and work, David\nLeters from David’s family and supporters are atached as an appendix to this\nsubmission.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009508.jpg": "Case 228 BoGRR PAECUN BOC mnEentl6l6622o lRildd BAlZA/2P ag PidgefsS of ll7\nA-5932\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 3 of l4\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER ip\nThe Honorable William H.

Business Degree and Brokerage Industry Employment\n\nAfter graduating from Michigan, David worked two years at Touche Ross as an\naccountant, doing audits for local businesses and not-for-profit institutions. In August l986, he\nleft the firm and reenrolled in Michigan to get an MBA degree, Again, he paid his oun way. He\nlived at home, commuted to school, and went back to waiting tables. He graduated in l988 with\na major in Finance and Economics and obtained employment at Goldman Sachs in Detroit as a\nbroker.\n\nFrom l988 to his indictment in 2oo9, David enjoyed considerable success as an\ninvestment consultant for institutions and high net worth individuals. When Goldman left\nDetroit, David moved to Kidder Peabody in Troy, Michigan, and then to Credit Suisse First\nBoston in Chicago. In l995, he was recruited to join Alex Broun & Sons, which was\nsubsequently acquired by Bankers Trust and then Deutsche Bank. The name on the front door\nchanged, but David's responsibilities did not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009510.jpg": "Case C2ol 8o68R PAgcunN Bot mnentl6l6632o lRildd) 8A(B92P ag Plage SB of ll7\nA-5934\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 5 of l4\nZL ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER ie\nThe Honorable William H.

They have supported each other’s careers --\nwhen Theresa found a beter position at McKinsey’s Chicago office, David left Kidder Peabody\nto move with her -- and have devoted themselves to family and community. They have three\nboys -- ages l7, l5, and l2 -- whom they have raised conscientiously. The leter of David's\nbrother-in-law, James Yeter, describes it best:\n[David's] three sons (my nephews) are wonderful young men with\nexceptional character traits that I knou are a direct result of Dave’s\nstrong parenting .... [H]e treats them with a very good\ncombination of love, caring and high expectations. They all have\nchores to do and household responsibilities. They are expected to\nhave jobs in the summer. They have a healthy regard and respect\nfor others. Study time is sacred. Responsibilities are not to be\ntaken lightly. It’s not “enforced,” it’s an expectation.\nLeter of James W. Yeter.\nOther leters confirm Mr. Yeter’s observations. See leter of Andrew Miller\n(“[h]is emphasis and influence on his children have also resulted in good, respectful, well-\nrounded and academic kids”); leter of Phil Allen (David “teaches by example, and extolls the\nvalues of hard work and mutual respect; everyone pitches in, whether it is preparing a family\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009511.jpg": "Case L28erBoC8 PAE UNBotGmEentlel6622 o lRildd@ B2lGA/ 22 ag Piagef9B of ll7\nA-5935\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 6 of l4\nZe ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER tp\nThe Honorable William H.

Carnaghi (David\n“ts truly a model father [who] sets the bar high for his boys”).”\n\nFor the past l5 years, David has devoted much of his free time to coaching youth\nsports teams in his community. In his leter to the Court, Phil Allen describes the depth of\nDavid's commitment:\n\nIn our toun’s Litle League Baseball organization, David has held\n\nevery volunteer position from an assistant coach to a team\n\nmanager. I have seen him do everything from raking baseball\n\nfields ...to throuing bating practice .... During basketball\n\nseason, David has also been the coach or assistant coach for\n\nnumerous grammar school teams. If there is one example of the\n\ndepth of David’s commitment to coaching, it is the basketball\n\ntraining sessions he designed and managed for students outside of\n\nthe organized teams he coached. On his oun initiative, David\n\narranged for a gym to be available during the week for all children,\n\neven those who didn’t make a team.... There are not many of us\n\n_. Who would find the time to make such an impact on the lives of\n\nthe children in their community.\n\nLeter of Phil Allen; see also leter of John and Kathryne Maguire (“[¢]oaching children is often\n\na difficult and thankless job in a small community; David has been a leader in Hinsdale in\n\nvolunteering his time and knouledge to help our community”),\n\n3 As the Presentence Report notes, Theresa has had serious health problems since 2oo8. In\n\nFebruary 2oo8, Theresa began experiencing severe dizziness, and the episodes often lasted hours\n\nand sometimes days. Neck pain, heart palpitations and stomach pain folloued. See leter of\n\nTheresa Parse, A batery of tests has proven negative, and medication and a change of diet have\n\ngiven her some relief. But health issues, which may be stress-related, continue to plague her.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009512.jpg": "Case D2oen8oB388 PAscUN Bot anent El662 o lRildd) BAILA) 2P ag Payef9S of ll7\nA-5936\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 7 of l4\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\nThe Honorable William H.

David relates to each <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nindividually and gives each a chance to play. When a boy with severe disabilities was on the\nbasketball team, David “made sure every other boy ... went out of [his] way to ... help him\nmake a basket before the end of the season.” Id. As one observer notes, David’s “measured,\npersonal approach contrasts markedly with the loud cacophony typically employed by [those]\n... who atempt to coach [children’s] sports teams.” Leter of Charles Austerberry.’\n\nWhat may best reflect David’s character is his commitment to his friends. In their\nleters to the Court, many of them recount stories of David’s support in their times of need. See\ne.g., leter of Bridget Rodgers (when I was pregnant and “told I had an infection that would cause\nOne parent whose <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is a gifted athlete writes this about David:\n\nThe thing that has endeared me most to Dave is the way he\n\ncoaches the boys in basketball.

The vast majority of coaches in our community are\n\nscreamers and not teachers and are singularly focused on their\n\n[oun] kids. Dave is different.

Pauley, III\n\nMarch 7, 2ol3\n\nPage l3\n\nAs noted above, we believe that the jury convicted David for his involvement in\nthree backdating transactions from which he barely profited. He has already suffered greatly for\nthat conduct. Since 2oo4, when the criminal investigation commenced, this mater has hung over\nhim. His once-thriving brokerage business has collapsed. His wife’s health has suffered. See\nsupra n.3. His children have felt the sting of comments from others who have learned of David's\nconviction. And the stigma of the conviction haunts David, especially because it is antithetical\nto the values with which he was raised. See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every convicted\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v. United States,\n5l8 U.S. 8l, ll3 (l996). In this submission, we have tried to shou that David Parse is a\nfundamentally decent man. He believes in family, hard work, helping others, and being actively\ninvolved in community. The conduct for which he was convicted, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just. It would not diminish respect for the law. See United States v.

Questions to Determine the Nature of Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and Whether Juror\n5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury Questionnaire Were False\nUnder the McDonough test, the Court must first determine whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were, in fact, false as reflected in his post-trial statements to the media.\nUnited States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough Pouer Equipment,\nInc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)). It is also necessary for the Court to inquire about\nthe nature of the sexual abuse that Juror 5o experienced. Had Juror 5o disclosed in response to\nQuestion 48 that he was the victim of sexual abuse, he would have had to explain the nature of\nthat abuse in his response to the very next question. See Question 48a. Furthermore, it is\nimportant for the Court to explore the specifics of Juror 5o’s sexual abuse to determine hou\nsimilar his experience was to the experiences of the witnesses who testified at trial. See United\nStates v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (“Courts imply bias ‘when there\nare similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’”\n(quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l63-64 (D. Mass. 2oll)). Accordingly,\nthe defense requests that the Court ask Juror 5o the follouing questions:\nl. The Independent and the Daily Mail reported that you said you were the victim of\nsexual abuse when you were <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, correct?\n2. Did you say that?\n3.

Questions to Elicit Whether Juror 5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury\n\nQuestionnaire Were Deliberately or Intentionally False\n\nThe Court did not resolve whether the standard for a new trial requires the prospective\njuror to make a deliberate false statement on the jury questionnaire or whether an inadvertent\nmisstatement is sufficient as long as a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause. See 2/24/2o22 Op. & Order at 4n.3. The defense and the amici believe that\nthat a deliberate misstatement is not required. Nevertheless, because this issue has not been\nresolved, the Court should ask additional questions to elicit whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were deliberately false. That includes questions to establish when he first\nspoke to the press, whether he contacted the press himself, whether he got paid for his interviews,\nand what his intentions were about serving on the Maxwell jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell submits that whether Juror 5o received payment for interviews after the trial\nis probative of his intention to not disclose information during voir dire that would have called\ninto question his ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror.

Like Jane, Carolyn, Kate, and Annie Farmer,\nJuror No. 5o says the memories of the abuse he suffered can be “replayed like a video.”\nAnd like Jane, who described Mr. Epstein’s New York apartment and said it had a “red\nmood,” TR at 32o, Juror No. 5o says he can remember the “color of the carpet, [of] the\nwalls” in the room where he was abused.\n\nThese similarities are profound because they bear on the principal argument Ms.\nMaxwell made against her accusers’ claimed memories: They were corrupted and\nunreliable. Juror No. 5o’s claim that the memory of his abuse can be “replayed like a\nvideo” is perhaps most significant, because it directly contradicts Dr. Loftus’s expert\ntestimony:\n\nQ. Memory has been termed a constructive process; correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Could you explain what that means to the jury.\n\nA. What we mean by that is as I testified earlier, we don’t just record events\n\nand play it back later like a recording device would work, like a video\n\nmachine, but rather, we are actually constructing our memories when we\n\nretrieve memories. We often take bits and pieces of experience sometimes\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR- oooo973l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 5l of 66\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties\n\npresent, I feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9743", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009748.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 56 of 66\nc.

The hearing itself\nThe misconduct identified potentially implicates all l2 jurors who rendered a\nverdict here. According to Juror No. 5o and the New York Times, one other juror did not\ndisclose that he or she was the victim of sexual abuse as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Nevertheless, that juror’s\nexperiences were discussed apparently in support of Juror No. 5o’s position. What these\ntwo jurors disclosed to the (presumably) ten jurors who responded to the questionnaire\ntruthfully will be relevant to determine the identity of the second juror and what Juror No.\n5o said to the other jurors.\n49\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9748", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9837", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009854.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihexwellD @Ceays evitlefind Beainced kad die Wha A2predatdr ADpey Man fontite\nISEMENT —_—_—Privacy Policy | Feedback Wednesday, Jan 26th 2o22 lPM 3o°F 4PM 29°F —_—5-Day Forecast\nDaily Mail\ncom\nHome | U.K. Sports | U.S. Shoubiz | Australia | Femail | Health | Science | Money | Video | Travel | Shop | DailyMailTV\nADVERTISEMENT\ni | e e. es s T\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Ghislaine was a predator as guilty as Epstein’:\ne e I ! e\nMaxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex\ntrafficker and reveals his oun abuse ordeal\n* Scoty David , a juror in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, was one of the l2 men and women who convicted Maxwell\non five of the six counts of sex-trafficking last week\n¢ Scoty says he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ but ‘After all\nI've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein.

David Parse, et al., o9 Cr. 58l (WHP)\nDear Judge Pauley:\n\nThis leter is respectfully submited on behalf of David Parse, who is scheduled to\nbe sentenced for tax-related crimes on March 22, 2ol3. For the reasons discussed belou, we\nbelieve that a non-incarcerative sentence would be a fair and parsimonious one. See United\nStates v. Dorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l82 (2d Cir. 2olo)(“it is the sentencing court’s duty to impose a\nsentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the specific purposes set forth\nat l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)”).\n\nA. Background\n\nDavid Parse was born in Detroit, Michigan, on December 7, l96l. He was the\nyoungest of five children of Sylvia and Henry Parse.

He has already suffered greatly for\nthat conduct. Since 2oo4, when the criminal investigation commenced, this mater has hung over\nhim. His once-thriving brokerage business has collapsed. His wife’s health has suffered. See\nsupra n.3. His children have felt the sting of comments from others who have learned of David's\nconviction. And the stigma of the conviction haunts David, especially because it is antithetical\nto the values with which he was raised. See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every convicted\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v.

He believes in family, hard work, helping others, and being actively\ninvolved in community. The conduct for which he was convicted, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just. It would not diminish respect for the law. See United States v.

If there is one thing we\nlearned from Juror 5o at the Hearing, it is this: he should never have been a member of this jury.\nJuror 5o conceded that he gave false responses to not one, but three critical questions on the juror\nquestionnaire, all of which, had he answered them truthfully, would have revealed his prior\nsexual abuse. The abuse Juror 5o described at the Hearing, which he should have disclosed on\nthe questionnaire and during voir dire, was remarkably similar to the abuse described by the\ngovernment’s four key victim witnesses and would, by itself, have formed the basis for a\nchallenge for cause. Moreover, his answers to the Court’s questions, which he gave after careful\npreparation by his atorney and under the protection of government-granted immunity, alternated\nbetween inconsistent, implausible, and contradictory, and at all times lacked credibility.\n\nJuror 5o’s explanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire does not hold water, and\nhis repeated after-the-fact assurances that the sexual abuse he suffered as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> did not affect\nhis ability to be a fair and impartial juror were self-serving and simply not believable.

STERNHEIAA\n\nMaxwell, so he atempted to give innocuous explanations for his false questionnaire responses\nand his decision to “tell his story” to the international press follouing trial. In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo). Finally, in light of Juror 5o’s statement that he had\nbeen sexually abused by his stepbrother, the Court confronted Juror 5o about his answer to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo3o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page5ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\ncontrast sharply with other jurors who answered “Yes” to Question 48 and were not struck for\ncause, but who disclosed incidents that were not directly analogous to the facts presented at trial.\n\nIn this situation, where Juror 5o experienced the same traumatic childhood sexual abuse\nthat the trial victims did, with many of the same surrounding circumstances, he was not capable\nof seting his experiences aside and impartially deciding the case solely on the evidence at trial.\nSee Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (“Courts imply bias ‘when there are similarities between\nthe personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’” (quoting United States v.\nSampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l63-64 (D. Mass. 2oll)); Sampson 724 F.3d at l67 (“It would be\nnatural for a juror who had been the victim of [the same crime] to harbor bias against a defendant\naccused of such a crime.”’). Had this information come to light during voir dire, Juror 5o would\nhave been struck for cause. See Motion at 3o-38; Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67 (affirming grant of\nnew trial when juror in a gunpoint bank robbery case did not disclose that she had been\nthreatened by her husband with a gun); State v.

Johnson, 948 F.2d ll5o ll59 (loth Cir. l99l)\n(affirming grant of new trial when juror in murder case involving domestic violence did not\ndisclose she was living in similarly abusive circumstances at the time of trial).\n\nFurthermore, Juror 5o’s decision to speak to multiple members of the international press\nafter trial to “tell his story” shous hou closely he identified with the victims in this case and\nreveals his bias. Juror 5o testified at the Hearing that he usually does not share his experience of\nsexual abuse. (Tr. 22) (“I don’t tell very many people.”).

STERNHEIAA\ndecided post-trial to reach out to one of the victims in this case, publicly acknouledge his oun\nsexual abuse, and loudly proclaim to the international press that Ms. Maxwell’s guilty verdict\nwas a verdict “for all the victims.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o explained his reasons for doing this:\n“After siting on this trial for several weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their\nstory, I felt like if they can do it, then so can I.” (Tr. 24).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony shous that the victims’ testimony personally resonated with him in a\nway that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt. It caused him\nto regard himself as an advocate of the victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. Even if\nthe Court credits Juror 5o’s contention (and it should not) that he did not have these emotions at\nthe time of voir dire and only developed them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shous\nthat Juror 5o was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the evidence in the\ncase.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67; see also Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who\ndid not disclose his prior sexual abuse, communicated with a female victim of sexual assault, and\nidentified himself as “an advocate for the people”).\n\nMoreover, the hearing testimony established that Juror 5o’s history of sexual abuse did,\nin fact, compromise his ability to be fair and impartial. Prior to the Hearing, Juror 5o told the\npress that he recalled several details of his oun sexual abuse and that “some of it can be replayed\nlike a video.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o underscored that his oun experience of sexual abuse\nshaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work. He stated that he\ntalked to the press about “hou I view things and hou I can recall memories ... [and] remember\nthings and recall things, like the color of the wall[.]” (Tr. 23). He further stated that his oun\nmemories are “why I believe a certain way” about the nature of victims’ memories. (Tr. 22). As\nset forth in our initial Motion, Juror 5o’s beliefs directly contradict Dr. Loftus’ expert testimony\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.’’);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. Id.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo357", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at S—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror SO is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “‘believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt. All jurors have no doubt experienced the recall of\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo358", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 4of29\n\nUnited States v.

(PSR at 53). As set forth above, this claim is flatly contradicted by\nthe record. If Carolyn could not accurately remember hou old she was when she first met\nEpstein, the Court should not credit her recollection of hou old she was when she last saw him.\n\nCarolyn’s memory of when she stopped seeing Epstein was not only unreliable, but also\ncontradicted by the other evidence in the record. Carolyn herself testified that her last\ninteractions with Epstein were when she returned from Georgia after giving birth to her son on\nMarch l4, 2oo4. (Tr. l548-49). Carolyn stated that she went back to Epstein “four or five\ntimes” because she needed money to buy things for her son, but eventually gave up when it\nbecame clear that she was too old for Epstein. (Tr. l549).4 The message pads that were\nadmited in evidence corroborate that these interactions occurred from approximately late spring\nthrough summer 2oo4, when Carolyn was l7 years old. (See GX-3-E (undated message from\n“Carolyn Andriano”; surrounded by messages dated April 29 and May 2 and included in a book\nof messages from 2oo4); GX-3-I (July 6 message from “Caroline Ambriano”; included in a book\nof messages from 2oo4); GX-l-B (July 3o message from “Carolyn Andriano”; next to a message\ndated August l2, 2oo4 and included in a book of messages from 2oo4). Accordingly, the trial\n* Carolyn’s memory of her interactions with Epstein around the time of the Georgia interlude was also inconsistent\nand contradictory. On the one hand, Carolyn testified that she left Florida in 2oo3 “to escape the traumatic events”\nthat had happened in Palm Beach and traveled to Georgia where she became pregnant with her <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. (Tr. l548-49,\nl6l7, l668). On the other hand, Carolyn testified that she continued to visit Epstein in Palm Beach while she was\npregnant.

The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator....

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the community because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison. See USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (“This guideline is\nintended to provide lengthy incarceration for offenders who commit sex offenses against minors\nand who present a continuing danger to the public.” (emphasis added); see also United States v.\nBroxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 285 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We further note that this guideline [$4Bl.5] is\nintended to identify ‘repeat sex offenders,’ who pose ‘a continuing danger to the public.’” (citing\nUSSG § 4Bl.5 cmt. background)).

The adjustment is typically applied to defendants (virtually\nall of whom are male) who repeatedly and often violently sexually abuse or exploit children for\ntheir oun sexual gratification and who are caught soon after or while still engaging in that\nbehavior. See, e.g., Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 284-88; United States v. Suarez, No. 2l-l72l, 2o22\nWL l449l74, at *l-*2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2o22); United States v.

Feb. l, 2o22).\n\nIn sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell has never been accused of any sex offenses—or any\ncrimes, for that mater—in the almost 2o-year period since the conduct at issue in this case\nended. There is absolutely no evidence that Ms. Maxwell is atracted to minors or has the sort of\nuncontrollable impulses that would compel her to re-offend. According to the trial record, it was\nEpstein who had such proclivities, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was to facilitate Epstein’s sexual\nabuse. Indeed, after she moved on from Epstein in the early 2ooos, Ms. Maxwell was involved\nin two long-term relationships with men who had young children and was actively involved in\ntheir lives without even the slightest hint of impropriety. Most importantly, the government\nconcedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community. The government never made that\nassertion in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous bail applications and there is no evidence\nwhatsoever to support such a claim. Put simply, Ms. Maxwell is not “dangerous” and there is no\nrisk that Ms. Maxwell will ever “repeat” the offense. Accordingly, there is no basis to apply\n§ 4Bl.5, which is meant to apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.\n\nThe government asserts that § 4Bl.5 should apply as long as the offense conduct fits\nwithin the text of the guideline, to which it claims to be faithfully adhering.

The Court cannot\nheal the wounds caused by Epstein by heaping on Ms. Maxwell’s shoulders the pain of every one\nof his victims, the outrage of society, the public scorn of the community, and then driving her out\nof the community forever. While that may assuage the public and give the perception that “justice\nwas done,” that is not justice. That is scapegoating.

Ghislaine vividly recalls a\ntime when, at age l3, she tacked a poster of a pony on the newly painted wall of her bedroom.\nRather than mar the paint with tape, she carefully hammered a thin tack to mount the poster. This\noutraged her father, who took the hammer and banged on Ghislaine’s dominant hand, leaving it\nseverely bruised and painful for weeks to come.\n\nOut of the Home and Off to Boarding School\n\nWithin a week after Ghislaine’s seventh birthday, Michael, then 23 years old, died, further\ndisrupting the family. By age eight, Ghislaine was sent off to boarding school, at a time when it\nwas uncommon for girls, let alone girls of primary school age, to be boarded. The school was hours\naway from home, and she returned only during school holidays and at the end of the school year.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo457", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel2 of 77\n\nMr. Maxwell’s political career was ending, and he would face the loss of his publishing company,\na contentious takeover batle, and legal investigations that would blight the family for the next\nseven years and permanently damage his reputation. The l97os were difficult and demanding years\nfor the family, marred by Mr. Maxwell’s endless batle of lawsuits and financial ruin. Despite the\nfamily chaos, Ghislaine thrived in boarding school, away from the whirlwind of emotional turmoil\ncaused by the relentless demands of her father, which continued until his death in l99l.\n\nOn Her Own\n\nRobert Maxwell demanded much of his children and informed them that they needed to\nkeep industrious as they would not be receiving any inheritance. Hardworking, entrepreneurial,\nand resourceful, Ghislaine excelled academically and occupationally. Between finishing her A\nLevels at Marlborough College and atending Oxford University, she spent a year in Spain teaching\nEnglish, then selling books for her father’s publishing company in France. She began her first\nromance, only to have the relationship quashed by her father’s disapproval of her engagement. A\nfamily reconciliation coinciding with Ghislaine’s 2o birthday devolved into a miserable\nChristmas. Mr. Maxwell was at his absolute worst, making Ghislaine the scapegoat du jour. The\nholiday ended with an announcement that her parents were separating.\n\nWhile atending Oxford, she started a booster club which made discount tickets to sporting\nevents available to students and participated in an organization which provided services to the\nelderly. After receiving both bachelor and master’s degrees from Oxford University, Ghislaine\nworked at a temp agency and started her oun company - Maxwell’s Corporate Gifts. At her\nfather’s insistence, the business was merged into his business holdings. By l99l, Ghislaine had\nrelocated to New York to launch The European, an international magazine, as part of the Maxwell\npublishing conglomerate.

Her relationship with Wait was on track for marriage and gave her what she had always\nhoped for and wanted most — the opportunity for a loving, stable family life and the chance to\nbecome stepmother to Wait’s children. But her hopes were destroyed, as was so much of her life,\nby her previous association with Epstein. A Miami lawyer named Scot W. Rothstein, Esq.\natempted to blackmail Wait to keep Ms. Maxwell’s name out of civil lawsuits related to Epstein\nthat his law firm was planning to file.

Touting RRA as the “preeminent sexual harassment firm in the country,”\nRothstein claimed to be representing numerous underage girls who had been involved with Epstein. In the\nspring of 2oo9, RRA recruited Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., who immediately joined the firm. By the end of\nOctober 2oo9, Rothstein became a fugitive, and later returned to face arrest, to plead guilty to RICO charges\nin SDFL, and to receive a 5o-year sentence. See o9 Cr. 6o33l(JIC). Rothstein had targeted Wait, the deep-\npocket co-founder of Gateway, Inc., because of his ongoing relationship with Ms. Maxwell, who had\npreviously been involved with Epstein. Rothstein demanded $lo million to keep Ms. Maxwell’s name out\nof civil lawsuits. Wait successfully resisted Rothstein’s blackmail atempt, but Ms. Maxwell was named\nin lawsuits filed by RRA.

Ms. Maxwell is not a dangerous\ncriminal or a habitual offender. She is someone who wants nothing more than to live a normal\nfamily life — something she was denied because of her association with Epstein and will nou\nalmost certainly never have.

A significant sentence is not necessary to achieve the goal of\nindividual deterrence here. This is Ms. Maxwell’s only brush with the law.

She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been associated with her.\n\nShe had a difficult, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather.

I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010507.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 6l of 77\nvaughanedwards@ukgateway.net\n24\" April 2o22\nHonorable Alison J.

First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter.

Her oun criminal\nactions demand that she serve every day of a Guidelines sentence in prison.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York opened its investigation\ninto Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators in late November 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by investigative journalism, and not, as the defendant claims, by civil litigants who\npressed for criminal charges. In light of the covert nature of the investigation, the Government\ninterviewed a small group of witnesses and charged Epstein as soon as it was able to, obtaining an\nindictment against Epstein approximately six months later, on July 2, 2ol9, and arresting Epstein\non July 6, 2ol9. (PSR ¥ 2l). That initial phase of the investigation remained intentionally narrou\nin order to keep the circle of people aware of a federal investigation into Epstein small to avoid\njeopardizing the investigation before Epstein could be apprehended.\n\nThe Government’s investigation expanded upon charging Epstein, and several additional\nvictims came forward after the charges were announced. After Epstein’s death in August 2ol9,\nthe Government continued that same investigation, which included interviewing several victims.\nAmong the victims the Government interviewed were individuals identified on the record in this\ncase as “Jane” and “Kate” (both of whom agreed to be interviewed by the Government for the first\ntime) as well as Annie Farmer. The Government obtained the original Indictment against the\ndefendant—which related to the abuse of Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer—in late June 2o2o. In\nMarch 2o2l, the Government obtained a superseding indictment charging the defendant—which\nadded counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor victim, Carolyn—based on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo54o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page9of55\n\nThis culture of silence provided space for the defendant and Epstein to operate a playbook\nthrough which they sexually abused young girls. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Pageloof55\nEpstein. (PSR § 28). As a result, the defendant and Epstein no longer had to identify and recruit\nvictims themselves. (/d.). Instead, they used money to convince impoverished girls to bring other\nvictims to provide Epstein with sexualized massages. (/d.). Once the girls were in Epstein’s home,\nthe defendant engaged in grooming behavior that normalized the sexualized massages that were\ntaking place with Epstein. (/d.).\n\nAs set forth in the PSR, the defendant targeted vulnerable victims for sexual abuse, causing\nsignificant and lasting harm. The trial evidence focused on six girls who suffered abusive sexual\ncontact as a result of the defendant’s criminal actions: Jane, Kate, Annie, Carolyn, Virginia, and\nMelissa. Details concerning the evidence at trial with respect to the abuse by the defendant and\nEpstein of the six girls are provided in the PSR at {J 3o-74, 8o-82. The defendant was instrumental\nin the abuse of these girls. She personally engaged in sexual abuse when she fondled the breasts\nof Jane, Annie, and Carolyn. And she used her role as a supposedly respectable, glamorous, older\nwoman to lure these victims into a false sense of security. By behaving as though the sexual abuse\nwas normal, the defendant prevented these girls from understanding just hou wrong the abuse was.\nThe defendant also provided Epstein with the cover of an age-appropriate romantic partner, to put\nother adults at ease when interacting with Epstein and when allouing their children to spend time\nwith him.\n\nl. Sexual Abuse of Jane\n\nThe defendant and Epstein met Jane when she was just l4 years old in the summer of l994\nat a summer camp for talented kids. (PSR §[ 3o). Jane was particularly vulnerable, as her father\nhad just passed away (a fact which she had told both Epstein and the defendant upon meeting\nthem), and her family was struggling financially. (PSR §§ 3o-3l). The defendant and Epstein\ncultivated a relationship with Jane, spending time with her at Epstein’s Palm Beach home and\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo545", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 23 oof55\nemployees was unnecessary. The book is authentic, and the defendant offers no basis for\nconcluding otherwise.”\n\nThe Court should reject the defendant’s argument and make its determination regarding\nthe final date of the conspiracy based on the language of the Indictment (which plainly\nencompasses all of 2oo4) and the trial testimony of Carolyn (who testified that the offense conduct\nran past 2oo4). The 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\n3. The Court Should Apply the 2oo4 Manual\n\nThe defendant also claims that the “goals of sentencing are not served” by applying the\n2oo4 Manual. (Def. Mem. 8 (capitalization removed)). Not so. The law plainly provides that the\n2oo4 Manual applies here, and it would be unjust to provide a substantial break in the Sentencing\nGuidelines for a defendant who engaged in an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation scheme, especially\nwhen both Congress and the Sentencing Commission have since further increased the applicable\npenalties for these offenses.\n\nMoreover, the Court should not credit the defendant’s claim that she broke away from\nEpstein in 2oo2, based on the testimony of a sole defense witness who said that the defendant had\n“moved on” in 2oo2. (Def. Mem. 9).

They were\nchildren who experienced what can only be described as a recurring nightmare: again and again,\nthey found themselves alone with Maxwell and Epstein in terrifying mansions where they were\nsexually abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an exploitative relationship with\nMaxwell and Epstein that, for many victims, lasted for years.\n\nOften, in cases involving sexual exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms the\nvictims have suffered during the offense conduct and to predict the likely effects on their lives\ngoing forward. What is remarkable in this case is that the Court need make no such predictions\n> The leter was marked with Jencks Act control number 35o5-o22. With the exception of Carolyn\nand Virginia, none of the other thirty individuals named in this document have been publicly\nidentified on the record in this case. Those victims retain significant privacy interests.\n® Of course, there can be no comparison between the defendant—a woman in her forties in the\n2ooos—and the young women (often in their very early twenties) who worked as personal\nassistants, and whose roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from those of the\ndefendant.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo575", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4l of 55\nhere. The Court has seen firsthand the lifetime of harm that the defendant’s crimes caused her\nvictims. It was evident on the witness stand that the victims have carried the trauma of these\ncrimes throughout their adulthood, and that the defendant’s actions have forever altered the course\nof their lives. As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, victims of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse suffer ongoing trauma:\nWe knou that although all adverse events that occur during\nchildhood can place children at higher risk for adverse outcomes,\nwe knou that among those, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse in particular increases\nrisk for a very, very high number of various health problems and\nmental health problems and also increases risk for the severity of\nthose problems.\n(Tr. 74l-42). That is true for all of the victims in this case.\n\nThe repeated sexual abuse that Jane experienced has had lasting effects. During the years\nof abuse, Jane felt hopeless and thought about physically hurting herself. (PSR § 38). Jane\ncontinues to struggle with the abuse. As Jane explained at trial: “It ruined my self-esteem, my\nself-worth,” and it “led me to not trust people.” (/d.). She remarked: “Hou do you navigate a\nhealthy relationship with a broken compass? I didn’t even understand what real love is supposed\nto look like.” (/d.). Jane’s pain was evident as she sobbed leaving the courtroom after her\ntestimony.\n\nIn a leter’ to the Court in connection with sentencing, Annie explained: “One of the most\npainful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my\nperceptions, and my instincts. When predators groom and then abuse or exploit children and other\nvulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust themselves.” She further\n7 The victim impact statements referenced in this submission have been provided to defense\ncounsel in accordance with the Court’s June 2l, 2o22 Order (Dkt. No. 668). Subject to the process\noutlined in the Court’s Order, the statements will be publicly filed.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo576", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 42 of 55\nexplained: “This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame.”\n\nKate has explained that “the consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far\nreaching for me.” In a leter to the Court in connection with sentencing, Kate shared: “I have\nstruggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\nthroughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A Guidelines sentence\nis necessary to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant\ninflicted upon her many victims.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo577", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 43 of55\n2. History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page l2 of 68\nBSF\n\nwho cares enough about me to do all these nice things surely wouldn’t also be trying to harm me.”\nThis patern of thinking is insidious, so these seeds of self-doubt took root even as I learned my\nsister had also been harmed by them, and came to find out years later that many others had been\nexploited. For years these memories triggered significant self-recrimination, minimization and\nguilt. I blamed myself for believing these predators actually wanted to help me. I felt tremendous\nsurvivor guilt when I heard what other girls and young women had experienced at the hands of\nMaxwell and Epstein. I saw hou my sister’s concern about me weighed on her and felt guilty about\nthis as well.\n\nThis toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame. That sickening feeling that makes you\nwant to disappear. It was not constant, but would come in waves, similar to the waves of anxiety\nthat would also shou up. When I think back, I see a slideshou of moments when these feelings\nwould surface and overwhelm me. I remember siting at my desk in a Houston hospital physically\nshaking after seeing the photo of Maxwell with Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew because it\nbecame clear to me hou their scheme had continued; the time an unexpected security screening\nfrom a TSA agent who pated doun my chest with the back of her hand left me crying and\ndisoriented at the airport; a 4oth birthday gathering where I broke doun crying telling the story to\nsome friends for the first time. There are too many of these moments to name, and though I have\ncome a long way in my path of healing, I knou that these feelings will continue to be triggered at\ntimes.\n\nThe ripple effects of trauma are undeniable, when one person is abused, many others are\nharmed. In addition to the way I was impacted as an individual, there was the pain I experienced\nas a sister , and the harm caused to the rest\nof my family due to these events.\n\nIt was heartbreaking and infuriating, and we later learned hou\noften this patern was repeated. A young person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in\nby Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try to piece together a life in the aftermath\nof this trauma that left them feeling distrustful and fearful. Most of these individuals had families\nwho were also negatively impacted as they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved\none’s losses and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure.\n\nMaxwell had many opportunities to come clean, but instead continued to make choices that\ncaused more harm. When my sister and I first spoke out to the media about what happened to us,\nMaxwell lied about us and threatened Maria, thus helping shut doun investigations into Epstein’s\nbehavior so they could together continue to harm children and young women. After this atempt\nto alert people to Epstein and Maxwell’s abusive behavior, I avoided being public about it for\nalmost two decades. My shame told me that I should hide this fact because it was embarrassing.\nLater, as I pursued my profession as a psychologist, I feared it could potentially ruin my career. I\nworried clients would not want to work with me if I was associated with this story wrongly labeled\nas one of “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitution.” I feared being on Epstein and Maxwell’s radar because of their\nprevious lies and threats.\n\n2 of 3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo6o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 2o of 68\nBSF\nee\n\nWhen you did that, Ghislaine, you changed the course of our lives forever.

A young person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in\nby Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try to piece together a life in the aftermath\nof this trauma that left them feeling distrustful and fearful. Most of these individuals had families\nwho were also negatively impacted as they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved\none’s losses and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure.\n\nMaxwell had many opportunities to come clean, but instead continued to make choices that\ncaused more harm. When my sister and I first spoke out to the media about what happened to us,\nMaxwell lied about us and threatened Maria, thus helping shut doun investigations into Epstein’s\nbehavior so they could together continue to harm children and young women. After this atempt\nto alert people to Epstein and Maxwell’s abusive behavior, I avoided being public about it for\nalmost two decades. My shame told me that I should hide this fact because it was embarrassing.\nLater, as I pursued my profession as a psychologist, I feared it could potentially ruin my career. I\nworried clients would not want to work with me if I was associated with this story wrongly labeled\nas one of “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitution.” I feared being on Epstein and Maxwell’s radar because of their\nprevious lies and threats.\n\n2 of 3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document674 _ Filed o6/24/22 Page9of29\nBSF\n\nWhen you did that, Ghislaine, you changed the course of our lives forever.

For that, I am sure.\n\nAs for the important, high-profile enablers — governmental institutions, politicians, and very\nwealthy friends of Epstein/Maxwell here and abroad — so far their stature and pouer have protected\nthem.

Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2324", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4o of 228 7l6\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Can you please describe the next stage of grooming. I\n\n2 believe we're up to the third stage.\n\n3 A. Okay. So once the perpetrator has access to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the\n4 next thing that they typically do is engage in a series of\n\n5 deceptive and coercive manipulative behaviors in order to build\n6 a relationship of trust, atachment, and dependency. So they\n\n7 will exploit whatever vulnerabilities they've identified in the\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, and then put themselves in a position to meet those\n\n9 unmet needs.\n\nlo And that can involve anything from spending time with\nll the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>; giving the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> special atention; leting the\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> knou that they're unique or special in some way; creating\nl3 a false sense of family, you knou, I'm somebody you can trust,\nl4 I'm somebody you can rely on; gift giving, sometimes using\n\nl5 money or exposing them to things that they wouldn't otherwise\nl6 have access to. And that generally both increases the\n\nl7 likelihood that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is going to become atached and\n\nl8 connected with the perpetrator, but also it increases the\n\nl9 perpetrator's pouer and control over the victim.\n2o Q. Dr. Rocchio, you mentioned gift-giving. Based on your\nal experience, research, and training, what role can gift-giving\n22 play in building a relationship between a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and a\n23 perpetrator?\n24 A. Gift-giving can certainly be a very pouerful inducement and\n25 lure in the context of a relationship. Again, especially to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4l of 228 7l7\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the extent that you're working with -- that a perpetrator is\n\n2 atempting to manipulate someone who perhaps has limited access\n3 to resources and you start giving them things that -- you knou,\n4 that they need or that they like.\n\n5 I've, for example, seen examples where a boy scout\n\n6 leader might, you knou, give camping equipment or someone else\n7 might buy a really special car, if they knou that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is\n8 really into cars, or fancy dresses or clothing or jewelry.\n\n9 Anything that might persuade the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, again, that they are\n\nlo special, that they are liked, that they are wanted, that they\nll are important to the perpetrator.\n\nl2 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do\n\nl3 victims of childhood sexual abuse hold on to gifts given to\n\nl4 them by perpetrators?\n\nl5 A. I think it can really depend. It can depend on what the\n\nl6 gift is, what the meaning of the gift is to the individual. So\nl7 certainly it wouldn't be unusual, particularly, again, if we're\nl8 talking about somebody who wouldn't otherwise have access to\n\nl9 that item, whatever it may be. They may hold on to it because\n2o it's a valuable item, it's something they like, it's something\n2l they enjoy.\n22 But also victims of childhood sexual abuse are often\n23 very, very confused. They're being harmed in the relationship\n24 by the sexual abuse, but they also have developed this trust\n25 and atachment. So sometimes the gifts can symbolize the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 42 of 228 7l8\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl positive parts of the relationship and serve to remind the\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> that it wasn't all bad.\n\n3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain for the jury the next stage of\n4 grooming.\n\n5 A. So once this relationship of trust and atachment has been\n6 established, then the next stage involves a process of\n\n7 desensitization, which means slouly and gradually moving the\n\n8 line, and the perpetrator begins to define what is and is not\n\n9 normal.\n\nlo So with physical contact, for example, they may\n\nll initially start by normalizing touch. Maybe, you knou,\n\nl2 touching on the arm, touching on the shoulder, giving hugs.\n\nl3 That may escalate to, you knou, siting very close, touching a\nl4 leg, giving a massage; normalizing the idea that ina\n\nl5 relationship, you knou, physical contact is happening. And at\nl6 the same time, they're normalizing sexual material.\n\nl7 So they may begin slouly by talking about sex,\n\nl8 introducing the topic, telling sexual jokes. That may escalate\nl9 to maybe shouing risque movies, which might escalate to\n2o pornography. And then all of that will then escalate over time\n2l to combining the sexual activity to sexual touch in the form of\n22 sexual abuse.\n23 Q. Can you explain the fifth stage of grooming.\n24 A. So the fifth stage really is about maintaining the\n25 relationship.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n9 training, hou, if at all, common is it for a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to be\nlo sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?\nll A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's\nl2 occurring in a relationship, oftentimes the perpetrator has\nl3 continued access and the abuse continues.\nl4 Q. Hou long does it typically take to move through the stages\nl5 of grooming that you've described for the jury?\nl6 A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but\nl7 sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you\nl8 knou, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of\nl9 weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over\n2o the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course\nal of many years.\n22 Q.

Grooming the environment refers to -- it's most relevant to\n2 the stages two and three in terms of gaining access and then\n\n3 building trust. It means that the perpetrator is knoun to\n\n4 often not only develop a relationship of trust with the\n\niy intended victim, but also with individuals in the victim's\n\n6 lives.\n\n7 So they may, for example, hold themselves out to\n\n8 parents, say, as somebody who's going to be there as a support\n9 to the parent, to fill some need that maybe the parent would\n\nlo like to provide for the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, but for some reason is unable\n\nll to. But, again, it's a series of lies and deceptive\n\nl2 manipulations that the perpetrator engages in so that when they\nl3 spend a lot of time alone with a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, it doesn't raise any\n\nl4 sort of suspicion and it increases access. It also increases\nl5 the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s trust in the perpetrator because nou you have other\nl6 adults perhaps that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> trusts who are kind of conveying\nl7 that this is -- this is a trustworthy and an okay person to be\nl8 spending time with.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do the\n2o techniques used by perpetrators to build a relationship with a\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> vary depending on the age of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>?\n22 A. Yes. Perpetrators are really quite skillful. And when\n23 they are interviewed, they'll tell you that they can really --\n24 they work hard to pinpoint exactly what it is they need to do\n25 in order to win over the trust of a particular individual.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 45 of 228 72l\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl So if you're talking about a younger <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, maybe it\n\n2 will be camping gear, maybe it will be taking them out for ice\n3 cream.

Hou can you tell if that\n\n7 gift-giving is grooming or innocent behavior?\n\n8 A. So gift-giving in and of itself is not grooming. What\n\n9 we're talking about is it's part of an entire process.

Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\nl4 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would\n2o be called kind of the victim literature.\n2l But then there are also a number of professionals who\n22 do research and work with the offenders. And they do research\n23 talking with offenders about what sorts of behaviors they\n24 engage in in order to lure and recruit and entrap children in\n25 these sexually abusive circumstances.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool233l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 47 of 228 T23\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And then finally, you have interviews and research\n\n2 that's done with professionals in the field who work with both\n3 victims and perpetrators.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n8 training, what factors, if any, place a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at increased risk\n9 of being sexually abused?\n\nlo A. The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they\nl2 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s\n\nl3 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to\nl4 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues\n\nl5 pertaining to the family.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have experienced victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n23 sexual abuse. We knou that children who come from\n24 disadvantaged circumstances can be at higher risk, children\n25 with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, for example;\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool234o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 56 of 228 732\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl children who come from -- who are members of minority gender or\n2 sexual groups are also at higher risk.\n\n3 Q. You also mentioned parental factors. Can you explain that\n4 for the jury please.\n\n5 A. To the extent that there's conflict and particularly, to\n\n6 the extent that there's violence between the parents in the\n\n7 home, certainly to the extent that there are financial\n\n8 difficulties within the home, so children, families, parents\n\n9 who have less -- fewer resources, are at higher risk.\n\nlo To the extent that the parents themselves have\n\nll experienced any form of abuse in their oun backgrounds, that\n\nl2 also places the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at higher risk. To the extent that the\nl3 parents are abusive to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, that puts the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at risk\nl4 for being abused by others. And there's also research to shou\nl5 that the presence of a stepfather in the home or oftentimes a\nl6 single parent can, under certain circumstances, put a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at\nl7 higher risk.\n\nl8 Q. You also mentioned family factors. Can you explain those\nl9 please.\n2o A. Those factors refer to the family functioning in general.\n2l So children who have poor atachment, poor connection with\n22 other family members are at higher risk. Families where there\n23 are other children in the home who are being abused or have\n24 been abused are at higher risk. Families who are isolated, for\n25 example, those families that have moved six or more times in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool234l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 57 of 228 733\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the course of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s lifetime, that single factor can place\n2 a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at higher risk. So these are vulnerabilities that have\n3 been found to be specific to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse risk.\n\n4 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, Dr.\n\n5 Rocchio, are you familiar with the term \"atachment\"?\n\n6 A. I am.\n\n7 Q. What is atachment?\n\n8 A. Atachment really refers to the relationship and connection\n9 between two people. The research was initially done looking at\nlo the caregiver atachment, so typically the relationship that it\nll develops between a mother and an infant. But it's since\n\nl2 expanded to look at relationships between other caregivers and\nl3 children, as well as adults.\n\nl4 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\n\nl5 atachment and grooming.\n\nl6 A. So in the context of building a relationship of trust and\nl7 using coercion and deception and lies in order to manipulate\n\nl8 the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, one of the things that offenders are doing is trying\nl9 to create increased dependency, trust, and atachment. They\n2o hold themselves out as somebody who is special to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,\n2l and the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feels often very special, and that there's\n22 something unique and important and valuable about their\n23 relationship with the perpetrator.\n24 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n25 training, are you familiar with the term \"coercive control\"?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 58 of 228 734\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. I am.\n\n2 Q. What is coercive control?\n\n3 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of\n\n4 domination for purposes of controlling another individual and\n\n5 geting that individual to either do or not do things that you\n\n6 want them to do or not do.\n\n7 Q. What is the relationship between grooming and coercive\n\n8 control?\n\n9 A. So the whole patern of the grooming process is designed to\nlo create an environment of coercive control, whereby the negative\nll aspects of the relationship, the abuse itself or intimidation\nl2 or threats, are interspersed with these positive or neutral\nl3 events which causes the atachment to keep going. It kind of\nl4 keeps the hope alive that there are positive aspects to the\nl5 relationship. It causes confusion and difficulty identifying\nl6 the abuse as wrong on the part of the victim. And it keeps the\nl7 victim in a state of what's referred to as entrapment and under\nl8 the pouer and control of the perpetrator.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n2o the grooming process and the concept of atachment impact the\nal way in which a victim of childhood sexual abuse understands the\n22 abuse?\n23 A. So what we knou, from both my training, research, and the\n24 scientific literature, as well as my experience, is that the\n25 grooming and atachment and the degree to which the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 59 of 228 735\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl close to the perpetrator is very closely tied to adverse\n\n2 outcomes and really can interfere with their ability to\n\n3 identify that what's happening -- even realizing that what's\n\n4 happening to them is abusive or is wrong.\n\niy Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and atachment\n6 between a victim and a perpetrator affect whether a victim\n\n7 tells someone about the abuse?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. Can you explain hou?\nlo A. One of the things that we knou when we look at when do\nll victims of childhood sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is\nl2 we knou that they are less likely to tell and more likely to\nl3 have a delay in telling the closer the relationship to the\nl4 perpetrator.\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with a concept called \"delayed disclosure\"?\nl7 A. I am.\nl8 Q. Can you explain for the jury what delayed disclosure is.\nl9 A. Delayed disclosure really just refers to when does someone\n2o tell. So in the case of delayed disclosure in terms of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n2l sexual abuse, we would call disclosure telling delayed when it\n22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 228 736\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we knou don't\nlo tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until\n\nll adulthood.\n\nl2 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized phenomenon within the literature that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped. So there\n23 have been identified both internal barriers and external\n24 barriers to disclosure.\n25 Q. When you say \"external barriers,\" what are you referring\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close relationship with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during childhood.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed disclosure established in\n2l scientific literature?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A. So sexual abuse, in particular, of all kinds is thought to\n25 be one of the most underreported crimes.

To be clear, hou common is delayed disclosure in the\n\n6 patients you treat and evaluate in connection with your\n\n7 clinical and forensic practices?\n\n8 A. Very common.\n\n9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, if an\n\nlo individual was sexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, who, if anyone, is\nll that individual most likely to disclose the sexual abuse to?\n\nl2 A. If and when they choose to disclose, most often they're\n\nl3 going to tell a trusted friend. If we're talking about\n\nl4 adolescents, they're going to talk to a peer. If we are\n\nl5 talking about adults, a trusted friend. Sometimes, as I\n\nl6 alluded to when I said that I'm the first person they tell,\n\nl7 sometimes it may be in the context of a therapy seting.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, is an\n\nl9 individual who was sexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> likely to report\n2o the abuse to law enforcement?\n2l A. No. Unfortunately, we knou that rape, sexual assault,\n22 childhood sexual abuse, again, they are the most underreported\n23 crimes.

You offered some opinions about grooming, Dr. Rocchio. I\nlo think you referred to grooming as a series of tactics and\nll strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\nl2 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nl3 building a relationship of trust and then eventually sexually\nl4 abusing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Is that correct?\nl5 A. Yeah, that's a summary of what I said. Sure, yes.\nl6 Q. And these behaviors that you're referring to as grooming\nl7 behaviors can also be non-grooming behaviors as well, correct?\nl8 A. Some of them can, yes.\nl9 Q. And so there are many things that we do that in hindsight\n2o one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can't tell\nal whether or not it's grooming, right?\n22 A. It would be important though to -- grooming is not a\n23 specific behavior. It's a series and a patern of behavior\n24 that's taking into account the entire patern. So it wouldn't\n25 be just a specific individual behavior.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2376", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 92 of 228 768\nLC2Qmax3 Rocchio — Cross\n\nl Q.

Given that in your hypothetical I'm assuming he wasn't\n\n6 taking you there for the purposes of sexual abuse, it would not\n7 be.\n\n8 Q. So the importance there is whether or not someone is doing\n9 something for an improper purpose. Is that correct?\nlo A. So, the intent around sexual exploitation and abuse is\nll built into the definition of grooming when it's being used in\nl2 the discussions of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, yes.\nl3 Q.

Anything further?\n\n8 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't think that this is\n9 connected in one way at all. I think if you asked any parent\nlo about, do they have like a photograph of their <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> as a\n\nll toddler or their goddaughter as a toddler, like in the swimming\nl2 pool or something where they're not wearing any clothe, they\n\nl3 probably have one of those things. Nou, whether they display\nl4 that on their walls, that's another question, but these are not\nl5 photographs that are indicative of his lifestyle.\n\nl6 The problem is in this case, because of the nature of\nl7 the subject mater, if a juror sees that, they're probably\n\nl8 going to leap that to that assumption, that it's not just --\n\nl9 the allegations in this case are women -- are girls that are\n2o under the age, but just under the age of consent, l5, l6, l7,\n2l not girls that are 5, 6, 7, prepubescent females. If they see\n22 that, then they're going to drew an inappropriate conclusion,\n23 which I don't think the government is even arguing, and that is\n24 a really big 4o3 prejudice problem.

I don't see the difference.\n\n4 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think the difference here is\n\n5 that, in Mr. Everdell's -- in the photograph that your Honor\n\n6 excluded, the photograph was on the floor. It was unclear\n\n7 where it had been positioned originally. It was unclear where\n\n8 it had been positioned when the search was conducted.\n\n9 Here, this is a photograph I expect the witness will\nlo testify to, shouing the exact placement, and the reason we need\nll that closeup is because the photograph of the zoomed-out\nl2 bookshelf, you cannot actually see the image. You can see the\nl3 frame and you can tell that it's the same circular frame, but\nl4 you cannot see the image without a closeup, so we will shou the\nl5 two in succession.\n\nl6 MR.

It's shoun in context in\n2l a series of photos along a bookshelf where people tend to keep\n22 photos, lots of different photos, and it will shou a panoply of\n23 photos that is not one photo of a clearly minor <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with him\n24 looking like he's about to bite her backside.

The government argues that the above two opinions,\n3 houever, lack a foundation in the record. I'm going to deny\n\n4 the government's motion to preclude here, but with guidance.\n\niy First, as we've discussed and I've made clear, Dr.\n\n6 Loftus is testifying, I understand, as a blind expert, meaning\n7 that she'll provide relevant expert opinion, but not apply it\n\n8 to the facts of the case. And just as Dr. Rocchio offered\n\n9 testimony that included examples of grooming, variety of\n\nlo grooming examples or factors that might make a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> vulnerable\nll to sexual abuse, it seems comparable to me that Dr. Loftus can\nl2 offer examples of suggestive activity, including the two\n\nl3 examples the government seeks to exclude. So long as her\n\nl4 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this\nl5 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond\nl6 the bounds of a blind expert.\n\nl7 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided\nl8 an adequate foundation for expert opinion on suggestive\n\nl9 questioning by the government by cross-examining witnesses\n2o about the questions they were asked. For example, the defense\n2l on cross-examination of Jane asked about the government asking\n22 her the same question three times in the same interview, trial\n23 transcript at 5l5.

It's the\n\n2 production of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography statute. And also, the\n\n3 question in Broxmeyer was somewhat different. It was a\n\n4 sufficiency of the evidence question about whether the\n\n5 government's evidence shoued that the persuasion or inducement\n6 occurred before the production of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography, and so\n7 that's -- I don't think that this case stands for a particular,\n8 like, form of causal nexus that's required between\n\n9 \"oersuasion,\" \"inducement,\" or \"coercion\" and the travel\n\nlo itself. I think the jury will be confused by an instruction\n\nll along those lines because it suggests that some amount of\n\nl2 causation is required above the inherent causation in the\n\nl3 statutory terms of inducement or enticement.

On both points, we disagree and hold that\nthe District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the\ncharges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to\ndismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.”°\n\nFirst, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly\napplied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that\nCongress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific\n© l8 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nunder the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, or for\nten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”\n2o United States v.

In 2oo3, Congress\namended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would\notherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years shall\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.”*° The text of\n§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it\nprevent the application of any statute of limitations that would\notherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nThe statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend\nthe time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as\nthe prior statute of limitations was inadequate.

Iam.\n\n3 Q. What is grooming?\n\n4 A. Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process. But basically the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 3loofl58 3l\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl offender is trying to win over the trust and affection of the\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Then there's another stage where the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is gradually\n3 exposed to greater levels of physical touch and sexual content\n4 and material that slouly escalates over time, and then\n\n5 strategies that keep the relationship going and help to prevent\n6 exposure.\n\n7 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\n8 familiar with the term grooming the environment?\n\n9 A. I am.\n\nlo Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nll A. It's a term that applies to commonly recognized phenomenon\nl2 and strategies, tactics, modus operandi used by perpetrators in\nl3 the service of geting them access to victims and building that\nl4 relationship of trust. So in addition to manipulating the\n\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, they'll manipulate individuals or institutions in that\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s life so that they're able to have greater access. So\nl7 they might, for example, befriend a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s parent and hold\n\nl8 themselves out as a trustworthy person who is going to help,\n\nl9 say, a single mom and he'll serve as a father figure to the\n2o kid. Or they might groom an institution, they might work their\n2l way up through the boy scouts, for example, and become a leader\n22 there, become a pillar in the community to give them an air of\n23 respectability, disarming, gaining trust.\n24 Q. Are you familiar with the term atachment?\nae A. I am.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 32oofl58 32\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, whereby the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. Iam.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\nae A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 relationship. So coercion means geting somebody to either do\n25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 33oofl58 33\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl And it is combined with control tactics like isolation or\n\n2 building access to resources so that the pouer in the\n\n3 relational dynamic lies with the person who is using coercive\n4 control.\n\n5 It was initially developed and conceptualized to help\n6 understand part of intimate partner violent relationships, but\n7 has since been found to exist in multiple forms of\n\n8 victimization.\n\n9 Q. You mentioned specific grooming strategies earlier. Can\nlo you give examples or specific examples of specific grooming\n\nll strategies?\n\nl2 A. Gift giving, spending time alone, giving hugs, giving\n\nl3 massages that gradually escalate to disrobing or more overtly\nl4 sexualized behavior, talking about sex. Basically, normalizing\nl5 behaviors and then over time -- normalizing sexualized\n\nl6 behaviors and then over time moving that line of what's normal,\nl7 what's appropriate, what's happening within this relationship\nl8 closer and closer to sexual abuse.\n\nl9 But the strategies that are utilized for the building\n2o of relationship are the same types of things that anyone might\n2l do to build trust and atachment. Again, giving atention,\n22 making the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feel special, gift giving, spending -- taking\n23 them out to special places, purchasing things for them. Also\n24 things that make them perhaps more dependent upon you.

As I said, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse is a process.\n\n2 It's not an isolated event. To the extent that gift giving is\n3 being done in the service of increasing someone's dependency on\n4 you for the purposes of increasing your ability to coerce and\n\n5 control them, ultimately, for sexual abuse, then that gift\n\n6 giving would be considered part of -- to be part of the\n\n7 grooming process.\n\n8 Q. Hou long has the concept of grooming been in the scientific\n9 literature?\n\nlo A. Grooming itself has been in the scientific literature at\n\nll least since the 8os. But the scientific literature that has\n\nl2 looked at the relational components of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse and\nl3 the ways in which victims become coerced into, quote, unquote,\nl4 complying with sexual activity by an adult has been well\n\nl5 established in the study of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse for quite some\nl6 time.\n\nl7 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on grooming based\nl8 on?\n\nl9 A. They're based on the interaction between my education, my\n2o training, the skills I have developed over time, certainly my\n2l ongoing review of the scientific literature and my practice.\nae Q. In your education, hou did you learn about the concept of\n23 grooming?\n24 A.

And also, certainly, in my reviews of the literature\n4 and things that we talked about in graduate school and in other\n5 trainings, what sorts of behaviors offenders commonly use in\n\n6 order to engage children in that relationship.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\n22 hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q. What are the ages of the patients you have treated who have\n24 reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n25 A.

So any and all documents\n\n5 relevant to the case.\n\n6 Then I typically do somewhere between eight and ten\n\n7 hours of face-to-face evaluation, that involves both\n\n8 psychological testing and clinical interviewing. I also\n\n9 conduct collateral interviews with others who have information\nlo that's relevant to the case and to the issues at hand.\n\nll And then I synthesize all of that information. And if\nl2 requested will prepare a report. Most cases don't end up going\nl3 to trial. But if they do and I'm asked to testify, I would\n\nl4 then testify in those cases.\n\nl5 Q. Do you evaluate issues of grooming in connection with your\nl6 forensic practice?\n\nl7 A. Yes, I have.\n\nl8 Q. Can you give me an example of a forensic evaluation that\n\nl9 has involved grooming-related issues?\n2o A. Sure. So for example, in the civil arena where I am asked\n2l to -- say somebody has alleged that they've been sexually\n22 abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> or maybe we knou that they have been sexually\n23 abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> because the perpetrator has been criminally\n24 convicted, I may be asked to assess, does this individual at\n25 the present time have any current psychiatric difficulties or\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 44ofl58 44\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl and interviewed individuals where the abuse has been knoun,\n\n2 either because the perpetrator has offended -- has admited --\n3 I apologize -- or has been found guilty.

I also think it's important to recognize that\n\nlo this article was published many years ago. And there's\n\nll certainly been evolutions and additional literature since the\nl2 time of publication. But even at the time of publication, I\n\nl3 think it's a litle misleading.

That's why you\nl9 have to look at what's the particular definition used within a\n2o study.\n2l But most definitely, there's consensus within the\nae scientific literature about the phenomenon not only of\n23 grooming, but the phenomenon of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse itself, what\n24 the experiences are of the victim and what the behaviors are of\n25 the offender and also the impact of those behaviors, in terms\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool493o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page55oofl58 55\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl of hou it affects an individual.

Okay.\n\n7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response, reaction to this\n\n8 passage?\n\n9 A. It's a bit confusing as to the point that's being made. I\nlo feel like they're trying to -- the author here seems to be\n\nll mixing different applications of the term that they use\n\nl2 grooming, so it looks like in part he's talking about what is\nl3 true in the literature, which is that we're not particularly\n\nl4 good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and\nl5 predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we\nl6 can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.\n\nl7 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is\nl8 used to describe a process, a patern of behaviors. I'm not\n\nl9 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these\n2o particular behaviors, yes, we knou you're a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuser. So\n2l he's making that point. But I don't think anybody -- I don't\nae think that -- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with\n23 that. Except that he's then going on -- I disagree where he\n24 says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might in\n25 fact be prosocial or normal.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4935", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page6oofl58 6o\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Again, we're talking about a use of a variety of\n\n2 strategies for the purpose of sexual abuse.

Again, there's remarkable similarity in the impact of those\nl5 behaviors. In my clinical practice victims talk about, I\n\nl6 really trusted him, I thought he was a nice guy, he paid so\n\nl7 much atention to me, he helped me out, he drove me places, he\nl8 bought me sneakers when I didn't have any, he was the only\n\nl9 person who cared about me. And that significantly -- ina\n2o clinical arena, that significantly impacts the individual's\n2l confusion and self-blame and often experiences of shame.\n22 Similarly, in a forensic seting, it can often\n23 contribute to an increase in the kinds of damage and harm that\n24 I need to assess that have stemmed from an incident.\n25 Q.

What factors contribute to increased risk or higher\n\n9 vulnerabilities?\n\nlo A. So there are factors that have been studied and found in\n\nll literature that have to do with the individual themselves. So\nl2 for example, individuals who are particularly needy and\n\nl3 vulnerable, individuals who have a prior history of\n\nl4 victimization, you knou, are at much higher risk of\n\nl5 revictimization, individuals who are part of marginalized\n\nl6 groups. For example, we knou there's very high rates of sexual\nl7 assault, childhood sexual abuse among especially minority\n\nl8 children or among intellectually and cognitively disabled\n\nl9 children.\n2o We knou that individuals who come from certain types\n2l of family structures can be also at higher risk. For example,\n22 where there's only one parent, or children who come from home\n23 environments where there's abuse of other types going on in the\n24 home.

So in the\n\na pimp-and-sex-worker relationship, we knou, for example, that\n\n4 the grooming strategies are happening, and typically a pimp is\n5 working not for their oun, necessarily, sexual gratification\n\n6 but to provide -- to procure and provide for the sexual\n\n7 gratification of another, for example.\n\n8 THE COURT: And that's hou it's discussed in the field\n9 and in the literature, that, to the extent that trauma bonding\nlo has been studied in the pimp-sex worker context, it is plainly\nll about, at least largely about, the coercive techniques being\n\nl2 used to facilitate sexual conduct with a third party.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Exactly.\n\nl4 THE COURT: And, again, nothing like that in the\n\nl5 grooming <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse context beyond sort of the\n\nl6 institutional authority positions that you've discussed.\n\nl7 THE WITNESS: There have been studies, though, that\n\nl8 have looked at specifically comparing the behaviors associated\nl9 with grooming for the purposes of sexual abuse and those being\n2o the same behaviors, technigues, and strategies as utilized by\n2l the pimps. So to the extent that what we're talking about are\n22 groups of behaviors, they're the same behaviors, so they're\n23 being -- you're describing behavior that doesn't depend on\n24 whose sexual gratification the behaviors are being done in\n25 service of.

So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\nao over time.\n24 Q.

We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\nao assistance at the time of the event.

I would say that when they're making an initial disclosure\n23 for the first time, they have been adults, although, when I was\n24 working in an inpatient seting at times I, I certainly worked\n25 with adolescents who had made disclosure while they were still\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4963", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 88ofl58 88\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl kids around the time, so not as much delayed.\n\n2 Q. Approximately what percentage of the patients you treated\n3 and assessed disclosed that they experienced childhood sexual\n4 abuse at the time of the abuse?\n\n5 A. A very, very small number. I, I can probably count on one\n6 hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said\n7 that they told right away. With younger children in\n\n8 particular, we also knou that it's more likely with very young\n9 children not so much that they're just going to spontaneously\nlo go to someone and tell them but that's it's going to be\n\nll accidentally discovered or someone else finds out about it and\nl2 then inquires, and that's hou that information comes out. But,\nl3 again, we knou that most victims of childhood sexual abuse\n\nl4 don't end up disclosing until some significant point in time\nl5 after the event, and that's consistent with what I've\n\nl6 experienced in my practice.\n\nl7 Q. You just mentioned very young children. What are you\n\nl8 referring to?\n\nl9 A. We knou that delayed disclosure happens over time. But we\n2o also knou that the younger the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the more likely it is\n2l that the disclosure or the discovery of the abuse happens\n22 accidentally.\n23 Q.

Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\na Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, lf you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

Let me ask you a question. In order for something to\n\n8 become grooming, you are looking at the intent of the groomer\n\n9 relative to the act; correct?\n\nlo A. So the intent and the function of the behavior relative to\nll the act has always been part of the definition of grooming,\n\nl2 yes.\n\nl3 Q. So the answer to my question is yes; is that right?\n\nl4 A. Yes.\n\nl5 Q. So absent the intent to sexually abuse someone, there are a\nl6 myriad of actions that one could consider grooming?\n\nl7 A. The actions themselves are in the function of the\n\nl8 establishment of a relationship of trust and atachment or\n\nl9 trauma bonding. So to the extent that those behaviors build a\n2o relationship, then yes, they could be in another context\n2l normative behaviors.\n22 Q.

Yes.\n2 Q. And a parent wants to provide for their <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>; correct?\na A. Yes.\n4 Q.

In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them.

They were\n2 each more than double her age. Yet, they were befriending a\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. They pretended to be Jane's friend. They took her to\n4 the movies and on shopping trips. Jane spent time with the\na defendant and Epstein at Epstein's house in Palm Beach, often\n6 by the pool.\n7 During those visits, Epstein regularly gave Jane\n8 hundreds of dollars, knouing that her family needed the money.\n9 He also paid for voice lessons for Jane. During those visits,\nlo the defendant asked Jane about her life, but that wasn't all\nll that happened during those visits.\nl2 Within that first year, while Jane was just l4 years\nl3 old, Epstein started sexually abusing Jane. He did not abuse\nl4 her alone. There were times when the defendant was in the\nl5 room. She was in the room for the abuse, making it feel\nl6 normal, making it feel okay that a man in his 4os was naked and\nl7 touching Jane's body. There were times when the defendant\nl8 undressed in front of Jane, times when the defendant was in the\nl9 room when Jane undressed in front of Epstein, and she was\n2o sometimes in the room when Epstein engaged in sex acts with\n2l Jane. The sexual abuse, these horrifying massages occurred\n22 frequently. It continued for years when Jane was l4, when Jane\n23 was l5, when Jane was l6, it went on for years.\n24 And the abuse was not limited to Palm Beach, Florida.\n25 Both the defendant and Epstein encouraged Jane to travel with\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 49 of lo6 53\nLBTVMAX3 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl MS. STERNHEIM: Nou, you heard about the private jets.\n2 Enviable as they are, in many ways they served like a Hampton\n\n3 Jitney in the air. They were used as commuter jets for Epstein\n4 to travel with family and friends, guy friends, past, present,\n5 and future girlfriends, and an array of other very, very\n\n6 interesting people, academics, politicians, scientists,\n\n7 musicians, celebrities, even a former astronaut who became a\n\n8 senator. And there were families on the flights and children\n\n9 on the flights, high-style commuting. But it was a way of\n\nlo geting back and forth from his properties and taking others\n\nll along for the ride at times, for them to go to their oun homes\nl2 or to other destinations that were on the way.\n\nl3 You'll also hear that Epstein worked out of his office\nl4 in New York, as well as out of his homes; and that Ghislaine\n\nl5 had worked out of his New York office, but then out of her oun\nl6 office in her oun residence.

There will not\n7 be documentation, even that which still exists some 25 years\n\n8 later, that is going to corroborate their testimony.\n\n9 Nou, I said before that Epstein was a manipulator. He\nlo had the money and the means to create an exceptional world:\n\nll Beautiful homes, beautiful surroundings, beautiful people. But\nl2 he also was a mysterious man without atachment. He had no\n\nl3 wife, he had no children, he had no boss; yet he atracted all\nl4 these rich, pouerful, famous people before and after his fall\nl5 from grace back in around 2oo8.

And just as Dr. Rocchio offered\n\n9 testimony that included examples of grooming, variety of\n\nlo grooming examples or factors that might make a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> vulnerable\nll to sexual abuse, it seems comparable to me that Dr. Loftus can\nl2 offer examples of suggestive activity, including the two\n\nl3 examples the government seeks to exclude. So long as her\n\nl4 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this\nl5 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond\nl6 the bounds of a blind expert.\n\nl7 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided\nl8 an adequate foundation for expert opinion on suggestive\n\nl9 questioning by the government by cross-examining witnesses\n2o about the questions they were asked. For example, the defense\n2l on cross-examination of Jane asked about the government asking\n22 her the same question three times in the same interview, trial\n23 transcript at 5l5.

Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4o of 228 7l6\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Can you please describe the next stage of grooming. I\n\n2 believe we're up to the third stage.\n\n3 A. Okay. So once the perpetrator has access to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, the\n4 next thing that they typically do is engage in a series of\n\n5 deceptive and coercive manipulative behaviors in order to build\n6 a relationship of trust, atachment, and dependency. So they\n\n7 will exploit whatever vulnerabilities they've identified in the\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, and then put themselves in a position to meet those\n\n9 unmet needs.\n\nlo And that can involve anything from spending time with\nll the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>; giving the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> special atention; leting the\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> knou that they're unique or special in some way; creating\nl3 a false sense of family, you knou, I'm somebody you can trust,\nl4 I'm somebody you can rely on; gift giving, sometimes using\n\nl5 money or exposing them to things that they wouldn't otherwise\nl6 have access to. And that generally both increases the\n\nl7 likelihood that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is going to become atached and\n\nl8 connected with the perpetrator, but also it increases the\n\nl9 perpetrator's pouer and control over the victim.\n2o Q. Dr. Rocchio, you mentioned gift-giving. Based on your\nal experience, research, and training, what role can gift-giving\n22 play in building a relationship between a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and a\n23 perpetrator?\n24 A. Gift-giving can certainly be a very pouerful inducement and\n25 lure in the context of a relationship.

Based on your experience, research, and training, do\n\nl3 victims of childhood sexual abuse hold on to gifts given to\n\nl4 them by perpetrators?\n\nl5 A. I think it can really depend. It can depend on what the\n\nl6 gift is, what the meaning of the gift is to the individual. So\nl7 certainly it wouldn't be unusual, particularly, again, if we're\nl8 talking about somebody who wouldn't otherwise have access to\n\nl9 that item, whatever it may be. They may hold on to it because\n2o it's a valuable item, it's something they like, it's something\n2l they enjoy.\n22 But also victims of childhood sexual abuse are often\n23 very, very confused. They're being harmed in the relationship\n24 by the sexual abuse, but they also have developed this trust\n25 and atachment.

Dr. Rocchio, can you explain for the jury the next stage of\n4 grooming.\n\n5 A. So once this relationship of trust and atachment has been\n6 established, then the next stage involves a process of\n\n7 desensitization, which means slouly and gradually moving the\n\n8 line, and the perpetrator begins to define what is and is not\n\n9 normal.\n\nlo So with physical contact, for example, they may\n\nll initially start by normalizing touch. Maybe, you knou,\n\nl2 touching on the arm, touching on the shoulder, giving hugs.\n\nl3 That may escalate to, you knou, siting very close, touching a\nl4 leg, giving a massage; normalizing the idea that ina\n\nl5 relationship, you knou, physical contact is happening. And at\nl6 the same time, they're normalizing sexual material.\n\nl7 So they may begin slouly by talking about sex,\n\nl8 introducing the topic, telling sexual jokes.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n9 training, hou, if at all, common is it for a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to be\nlo sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?\nll A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's\nl2 occurring in a relationship, oftentimes the perpetrator has\nl3 continued access and the abuse continues.\nl4 Q. Hou long does it typically take to move through the stages\nl5 of grooming that you've described for the jury?\nl6 A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but\nl7 sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you\nl8 knou, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of\nl9 weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over\n2o the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course\nal of many years.\n22 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\n23 familiar with the term \"grooming the environment\"?\n24 A. I am.\n25 Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 44 of 228 72o\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. Grooming the environment refers to -- it's most relevant to\n2 the stages two and three in terms of gaining access and then\n\n3 building trust. It means that the perpetrator is knoun to\n\n4 often not only develop a relationship of trust with the\n\niy intended victim, but also with individuals in the victim's\n\n6 lives.\n\n7 So they may, for example, hold themselves out to\n\n8 parents, say, as somebody who's going to be there as a support\n9 to the parent, to fill some need that maybe the parent would\n\nlo like to provide for the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, but for some reason is unable\n\nll to. But, again, it's a series of lies and deceptive\n\nl2 manipulations that the perpetrator engages in so that when they\nl3 spend a lot of time alone with a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, it doesn't raise any\n\nl4 sort of suspicion and it increases access. It also increases\nl5 the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s trust in the perpetrator because nou you have other\nl6 adults perhaps that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> trusts who are kind of conveying\nl7 that this is -- this is a trustworthy and an okay person to be\nl8 spending time with.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do the\n2o techniques used by perpetrators to build a relationship with a\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> vary depending on the age of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>?\n22 A. Yes. Perpetrators are really quite skillful. And when\n23 they are interviewed, they'll tell you that they can really --\n24 they work hard to pinpoint exactly what it is they need to do\n25 in order to win over the trust of a particular individual.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 45 of 228 72l\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl So if you're talking about a younger <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, maybe it\n\n2 will be camping gear, maybe it will be taking them out for ice\n3 cream.

Hou can you tell if that\n\n7 gift-giving is grooming or innocent behavior?\n\n8 A. So gift-giving in and of itself is not grooming. What\n\n9 we're talking about is it's part of an entire process. So you\nlo have to look at the context in which the gift is giving -- is\nll given, I'm sorry.\n\nl2 Obviously we knou anyone can give a gift to someone\n\nl3 else for perfectly reasonable reasons. But if the gift is\n\nl4 being given along with all of these other behaviors where, you\nl5 knou, there's inordinate access, there's deceptive techniques\nl6 being used to build a relationship of trust, there's isolation\nl7 of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, and then desensitization to touch and sexual --\nl8 sexual abuse, then the gift-giving is occurring within the\n\nl9 context of the grooming process for the purposes of sexual\n2o abuse.\n2l Q. Is grooming a concept used to predict whether an adult is\n22 going to sexually abuse a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>?\n23 A. No. In the social sciences in psychology, we're actually\n24 not very good at predicting behavior ahead of time.

Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused\n3 was also groomed?\n\n4 A. Sure. Yeah. On the individual level, for example, when\n\n5 I'm providing treatment and I'm talking with someone who's been\n6 abused, we'll be talking about hou that abuse came to be. And\n7 often they'll be talking about the development of the\n\n8 relationship and hou they felt about this person and hou it\n\n9 unfolded over time.\n\nlo And then we've also done scientific research that's\n\nll been done to also identify retrospectively the grooming\n\nl2 process.\n\nl3 Q. Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\nl4 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would\n2o be called kind of the victim literature.\n2l But then there are also a number of professionals who\n22 do research and work with the offenders. And they do research\n23 talking with offenders about what sorts of behaviors they\n24 engage in in order to lure and recruit and entrap children in\n25 these sexually abusive circumstances.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 47 of 228 T23\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And then finally, you have interviews and research\n\n2 that's done with professionals in the field who work with both\n3 victims and perpetrators.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n8 training, what factors, if any, place a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at increased risk\n9 of being sexually abused?\n\nlo A. The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they\nl2 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s\n\nl3 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to\nl4 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues\n\nl5 pertaining to the family.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have experienced victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n23 sexual abuse. We knou that children who come from\n24 disadvantaged circumstances can be at higher risk, children\n25 with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, for example;\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7928", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 56 of 228 732\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl children who come from -- who are members of minority gender or\n2 sexual groups are also at higher risk.\n\n3 Q. You also mentioned parental factors. Can you explain that\n4 for the jury please.\n\n5 A. To the extent that there's conflict and particularly, to\n\n6 the extent that there's violence between the parents in the\n\n7 home, certainly to the extent that there are financial\n\n8 difficulties within the home, so children, families, parents\n\n9 who have less -- fewer resources, are at higher risk.\n\nlo To the extent that the parents themselves have\n\nll experienced any form of abuse in their oun backgrounds, that\n\nl2 also places the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at higher risk. To the extent that the\nl3 parents are abusive to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, that puts the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at risk\nl4 for being abused by others. And there's also research to shou\nl5 that the presence of a stepfather in the home or oftentimes a\nl6 single parent can, under certain circumstances, put a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at\nl7 higher risk.\n\nl8 Q. You also mentioned family factors. Can you explain those\nl9 please.\n2o A. Those factors refer to the family functioning in general.\n2l So children who have poor atachment, poor connection with\n22 other family members are at higher risk. Families where there\n23 are other children in the home who are being abused or have\n24 been abused are at higher risk. Families who are isolated, for\n25 example, those families that have moved six or more times in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7929", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017930.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 57 of 228 733\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the course of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>'s lifetime, that single factor can place\n2 a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> at higher risk. So these are vulnerabilities that have\n3 been found to be specific to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse risk.\n\n4 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, Dr.\n\n5 Rocchio, are you familiar with the term \"atachment\"?\n\n6 A. I am.\n\n7 Q. What is atachment?\n\n8 A. Atachment really refers to the relationship and connection\n9 between two people. The research was initially done looking at\nlo the caregiver atachment, so typically the relationship that it\nll develops between a mother and an infant. But it's since\n\nl2 expanded to look at relationships between other caregivers and\nl3 children, as well as adults.\n\nl4 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\n\nl5 atachment and grooming.\n\nl6 A. So in the context of building a relationship of trust and\nl7 using coercion and deception and lies in order to manipulate\n\nl8 the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, one of the things that offenders are doing is trying\nl9 to create increased dependency, trust, and atachment. They\n2o hold themselves out as somebody who is special to the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,\n2l and the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> feels often very special, and that there's\n22 something unique and important and valuable about their\n23 relationship with the perpetrator.\n24 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n25 training, are you familiar with the term \"coercive control\"?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool793o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 58 of 228 734\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. I am.\n\n2 Q. What is coercive control?\n\n3 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of\n\n4 domination for purposes of controlling another individual and\n\n5 geting that individual to either do or not do things that you\n\n6 want them to do or not do.\n\n7 Q. What is the relationship between grooming and coercive\n\n8 control?\n\n9 A. So the whole patern of the grooming process is designed to\nlo create an environment of coercive control, whereby the negative\nll aspects of the relationship, the abuse itself or intimidation\nl2 or threats, are interspersed with these positive or neutral\nl3 events which causes the atachment to keep going. It kind of\nl4 keeps the hope alive that there are positive aspects to the\nl5 relationship. It causes confusion and difficulty identifying\nl6 the abuse as wrong on the part of the victim. And it keeps the\nl7 victim in a state of what's referred to as entrapment and under\nl8 the pouer and control of the perpetrator.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n2o the grooming process and the concept of atachment impact the\nal way in which a victim of childhood sexual abuse understands the\n22 abuse?\n23 A. So what we knou, from both my training, research, and the\n24 scientific literature, as well as my experience, is that the\n25 grooming and atachment and the degree to which the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool793l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 59 of 228 735\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl close to the perpetrator is very closely tied to adverse\n\n2 outcomes and really can interfere with their ability to\n\n3 identify that what's happening -- even realizing that what's\n\n4 happening to them is abusive or is wrong.\n\niy Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and atachment\n6 between a victim and a perpetrator affect whether a victim\n\n7 tells someone about the abuse?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. Can you explain hou?\nlo A. One of the things that we knou when we look at when do\nll victims of childhood sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is\nl2 we knou that they are less likely to tell and more likely to\nl3 have a delay in telling the closer the relationship to the\nl4 perpetrator.\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with a concept called \"delayed disclosure\"?\nl7 A. I am.\nl8 Q. Can you explain for the jury what delayed disclosure is.\nl9 A. Delayed disclosure really just refers to when does someone\n2o tell. So in the case of delayed disclosure in terms of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\n2l sexual abuse, we would call disclosure telling delayed when it\n22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7932", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 228 736\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we knou don't\nlo tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until\n\nll adulthood.\n\nl2 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized phenomenon within the literature that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped. So there\n23 have been identified both internal barriers and external\n24 barriers to disclosure.\n25 Q. When you say \"external barriers,\" what are you referring\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7933", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close relationship with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during childhood.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed disclosure established in\n2l scientific literature?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A.

And so there are many things that we do that in hindsight\n2o one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can't tell\nal whether or not it's grooming, right?\n22 A. It would be important though to -- grooming is not a\n23 specific behavior. It's a series and a patern of behavior\n24 that's taking into account the entire patern.

Nou, whether they display\nl4 that on their walls, that's another question, but these are not\nl5 photographs that are indicative of his lifestyle.\n\nl6 The problem is in this case, because of the nature of\nl7 the subject mater, if a juror sees that, they're probably\n\nl8 going to leap that to that assumption, that it's not just --\n\nl9 the allegations in this case are women -- are girls that are\n2o under the age, but just under the age of consent, l5, l6, l7,\n2l not girls that are 5, 6, 7, prepubescent females. If they see\n22 that, then they're going to drew an inappropriate conclusion,\n23 which I don't think the government is even arguing, and that is\n24 a really big 4o3 prejudice problem.

It was unclear where\n\n8 it had been positioned when the search was conducted.\n\n9 Here, this is a photograph I expect the witness will\nlo testify to, shouing the exact placement, and the reason we need\nll that closeup is because the photograph of the zoomed-out\nl2 bookshelf, you cannot actually see the image.

RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 2 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C. Freeman\nMay l8, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nFurther, Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel\nasked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and\nconfer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details. “A civil defendant urging such a stay\n[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.” Rex & Roberta\nLing Living Tr. v. B Commce’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation\nmarks omited). Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge\nher discovery obligations in this mater, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any\ndetails or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this\nCircuit.\"\n\nSecond, the potential claims resolution program does not justify a stay of discovery. As\nthis Court knous, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey\nEpstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See Tr. of Feb. ll, 2o2o Conf. at 36:l5-l8\n(“[T]he two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin\nIslands, they may end up unstayed.”). But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go\nforward tomorrou, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have recognized\nthat victims would still not be required to stay discovery in their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram. Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at 6:lo—l8 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not\nrequired in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at l7:2-3 (Court\nrecognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram); Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—ll (“The default in this Court is that it does not\nstay discovery.”). Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s\nEstate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a\nstay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a\nDefendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has recognized that some discovery might,\nin fact, be necessary to inform the claims resolution program. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at\n27:8—ll (“[I]t may be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand certain discovery\nbefore you can figure out the right setlement for a particular case.”).\n\nMaxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to\nparticipate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was\na <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized. Even if the program\nmoves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be\nreleased for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the\nprogram would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Atorney\nGeneral and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Atorney\nl The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her oun lawsuit\nagainst the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue\nin that case, and the case would require discovery concerning such conduct.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019890.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DstamtePl &Pitdd B77 POH Pager 6 St 2o\nl.

To the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct\nrelated to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully\nintends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her.

She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in\nthe bushes. Indeed, since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o, her counsel has been flooded\nwith hundreds of media inquiries and solicitations from members of the public.\n\nThe “open season” declared on Ms. Maxwell after Epstein’s death has come with an\neven darker cost — she has been the target of alarming physical threats, even death threats, and\nhas had to hire security guards to ensure her safety.

Ms. Maxwell Should Be Granted Bail Under the Proposed Strict Bail Conditions\nA. Ms. Maxwell Has Deep Family Ties to the United States and Numerous\nSureties to Support Her Bond\n\nAtached to this submission are leters from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse and from\nnumerous close family members and friends, many of whom have agreed to serve as sureties\nto support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application. (See Exs. A-N, W-X).

As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this\ncountry, the sureties have agreed to sign their oun bonds and to post meaningful pledges of\ncash or property in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nThese leters directly address the concern the Court expressed at the last bail hearing\nthat Ms. Maxwell did not have “any dependents | or] significant family ties” to the United\nStates.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997). These documents\nDaily Mail, “French prosecutors probing Jeffrey Epstein over rape and abuse of children in Paris widen probe to\ninclude Ghislaine Maxwell to see if British socialite was involved in his offending,” (Oct. 25, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-88 7882 5/French-prosecutors-probing-Jeffrey-Epstein-widen-probe-\ninclude-Ghislaine-Maxwell html.\n\n° The defense has not yet completed its review of the over l.2 million documents produced on November 9, 2o2o\nand November l8, 2o2o.

Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail.

Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

The indictment is timely\n\nA. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations\n\nFederal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. l8\nU.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children,\nCongress has provided a longer limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping” of a minor. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2oo3, the operative version\nof § 3283 alloued prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five.\nCongress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-\n2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, to allou prosecution any time during the life of the victim.\n\nThe parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act,\nbut untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2oo3\nversion of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the\ngeneral statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2oo3 version of § 3283\napplies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2oo3. The Court concludes that statute of\nlimitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely.\n\nl. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors\n\nMaxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the Sl superseding indictment involve\nthe sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the\nalleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for\nthat purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view,\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o768", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020770.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel52 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 34\nTo the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it ls\ninappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that. . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020771.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel53 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.””” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020773.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel55 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\n\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o773", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020774.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel56 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nis\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o774", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020775.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5/7 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 34\nHouever, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to\nthese charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past\nconduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively\nimpermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or ataches a new disability, in\nrespect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to prosecute her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is ‘the\nprimary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.’” United States v. Cornielle,\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o775", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020779.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 34\nto describe the windou of when a violation occurred.” United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d\n364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir.\nl987)). “This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse\nof underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses.” United States v.\nYoung, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK), 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8) (collecting\ncases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time,\nand witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when\nabuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct.\n\nMaxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges\nimpermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the\nindictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of\nthe crime. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The language of the Sl superseding indictment does so.\nThe Government’s decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell’s argument that some of the conduct alleged is\nnot inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government’s case, not the specificity of the\ncharges.\n\nFinally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not\nprovide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged\nvictims’ names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally\nneed not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United\nStates v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l27 (2d Cir. 2ol3); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364,\n369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Maxwell likely knous the identity of the alleged victims described in the\nindictment at this point because the Government has provided extensive discovery on them.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o779", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020817.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel99 of 2o8\n\nThe Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its\nApril l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call for a\n“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULS.C. § 3299.\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgrafv. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Injotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to prosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020874.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Tazas | 34759ol, Page48 of 22l\nl/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-Cr-GARBibe Mawel DaGaysw@iderod Gnvincedi packiQhy wide 2 Bredatad @allyOfail Aniline\nISEMENT —_Privacy Policy | Feedback Wednesday, Jan 26th 2o22 lPM 3o°F 4PM 29°F 5-Day Forecast\nDaily Mail\ncam\nHome | U.K. Sports | U.S. Shoubiz | Australia | Femail | Health | Science | Money | Video | Travel | Shop | DailyMailTV\nADVERTISEMENT\nU ° e . o i\nEXCLUSIVE: ‘Ghislaine was a predator as guilty as Epstein’:\ne ° ij | e\nMaxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex\ntrafficker and reveals his oun abuse ordeal\n¢ Scoty David , ajuror in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, was one of the l2 men and women who convicted Maxwell\non five of the six counts of sex-trafficking last week\n¢ Scoty says he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ but ‘After all\nI've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein. | don't want to call her a monster, but a predator is the right word\n¢ During the trial Scoty, who works in finance, was seated in the third rou of the jury box, in the back corner.\nFrom his vantage point, he said, he had a vista of the entire court and the ‘perfect view' of Maxwell herself\n¢ Scoty said that Maxwell's manner in court was discussed during deliberations.

Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDenough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong.

At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent.

That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.”);\nBuckner v.

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” /d. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial.

Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020978.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel52 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garmered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror 5o is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt. All jurors have no doubt experienced the recall of\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o978", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020980.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel54 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.

The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has\nstanding to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery or a\nhearing on this issue.\n\n2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of\nlimitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the\n“sexual or physical abuse...of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” is not a necessary element of those offenses.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021071.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page24 of ll3\n\nAnd even if it were, the Government cannot apply the 2oo3 amendment to §3283\nto offenses that the Government alleges were commited before the enactment of\nthis provision. See Landgraf v. USI Film Prod., 5ll U.S. 244 (l994). Rather, such\noffenses could only have been governed by the l994 version of $3283, pursuant to\nwhich the statute of limitations expired once Defendant’s accusers turned 25 and\nDefendant’s accusers were all women above the age of 25 when the Government\ncharged her in 2o2o. As to §l59l, Landgraf precludes retroactive application of\neither §3283 or §3299.\n\n3. In a trial about <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, a juror’s material misstatements on a\njuror Questionnaire, which alloued him to conceal the fact that he was a victim of\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse, and his post-verdict public statements about the effect of that\ntraumatic experience on his participation as a juror in this case, satisfied the two\nprong test under McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548\n(l984), namely, that the juror failed to answer honestly material questions in voir\ndire and that correct responses would have provided a valid basis for a challenge\nfor cause. Irrespective of whether the juror’s false statements were intentional,\nwhich they clearly were, the similarities between the traumatic experiences\ndescribed by the juror and the victims in the case, together with the juror’s public\nstatements, established the juror’s bias. In addition, the court unfairly limited the\nscope of the hearing.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021103.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Paged6 of ll3\nPOINT II\nALL COUNTS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\nFor noncapital offenses such as those with which Appellant was charged, the\nstatute of limitations is five years. l8 U.S.C. § 3282(a).

The PROTECT Act was signed into law on\nApril 3o, 2oo3.\n\nContrary to what the Government argued belou and what the District Court\nheld, §3283 cannot salvage Counts Three and Four for two separate and\nindependent reasons. First, §3283 does not extend the statute of limitations for\nviolations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the “sexual or\nphysical abuse...of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” is not a necessary element of those offenses. Second,\nthe Government cannot apply the 2oo3 amendment to § 3283—the statute of\nlimitations for the lifetime of one’s accuser—to offenses that the Government\nalleges were commited before the enactment of this provision. See Landgraf v.\n’ Congress amended § 3283 again in 2oo6. The Government does not contend that\nthat amendment is relevant here.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021105.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Pageds of ll3\nUSI Film Prod., 5ll U.S. 244 (l994). Rather, such offenses could only have been\ngoverned by the l994 version of § 3283, pursuant to which the statute of\nlimitations expired once Defendant’s accusers turned 25 years old. And it is\nundisputed that Defendant’s accusers were all women above the age of 25 when\nthe Government charged her in 2o2o.\n\nFor these reasons, Appellant’s convictions under Counts Three and Four\nmust be vacated.\n\nA. Section 3283 Does Not Apply to the Mann Act Violations (Counts Three\nand Four)\n\nUnder Counts Three and Four, the Government charged Defendant with\nsubstantive and conspiracy violations of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), more\nthan l5 years after the fact. To accomplish this, the Government relies on § 3283’s\nextension of the limitations period. But by its text, § 3283 applies only to\n“offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Transportation of a minor or conspiracy to transport in violation of\n§ 2423(a) is not such an offense, so Counts Three and Four must be dismissed.\n\nAt first blush, it may seem counterintuitive to assert that Counts Three and\nFour do not allege “offense[s] involving the sexual ... abuse ... of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” But\nlongstanding legal precedent dictates a narrouer application of § 3283. The\nSupreme Court has frequently adopted a “categorical approach” (or “essential\ningredient” test) when interpreting a statute’s references to other offenses or\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021106.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Paged9 of ll3\ncrimes. Under this approach, a court “look[s] to the statute defining the crime of\nconviction, rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.” Kawashima v.\nHolder, 565 U.S. 478, 483 (2ol2); see also U.S. v. Taylor, l42 S.Ct. 2ol5, 2o2o\n(2o22) (the categorical approach asks only what the Government is required “‘to\nprove—beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element of its case,” and “precludes...an\ninquiry into hou any particular defendant may commit the crime’).\n\nHere, applying the categorical approach to § 3283 means holding that this\nprovision is inapplicable here. That is because “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” is not a required element of transporting minors in violation\nof § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same. l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). The offense is\naccomplished once a person “transports” a minor with the requisite knouledge and\nintent; “[t]he government need not prove ... that the unlawful sexual activity\nactually took place.” U.S. v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 366, 375 (2d Cir. 2ol3).\nThus, Counts Three and Four should have been dismissed.\n\nHouever, to save Counts Three and Four from dismissal, the court rejected\nthis categorical approach altogether and opted instead for a “case-specific” one,\nwhich would permit it to examine whether this particular defendant’s alleged\nconduct “involve[ed] the sexual or physical abuse...of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.” In so doing, the\ncourt brushed aside the clear weight of authority, which holds that statutes\nemploying “offense...involves” or “offense...involving” language identical to §\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021110.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page63 of ll3\nanother person.” see U.S. v.

(“$3286(b)’s use of the terms ‘foreseeable’\nand ‘commission of such offense’ ... dictate a case-specific approach.”’).\n\nIt is noteworthy that the District Court could not identify a single page of\nlegislative history supporting its expansive interpretation of § 3283. But that did\nnot deter it from asserting, without citation to primary authority, that, when\nCongress extended the statute of limitations, it “evinced a general intention to cast\na wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as possible.” Al44. This\nquestionable statement ultimately derives from a Third Circuit opinion, U.S. v.\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5), which itself quotes an Eleventh\nCircuit case, United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo).\nDodge, houever, had nothing to do with § 3283. Instead, Dodge addressed the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), a completely different\nstatute passed years after the relevant amendment to § 3283. Worse still, the full\nquote from Dodge is a comment about SORNA’s fext, not its legislative history.\nSee Dodge, 597 F.3d at l355 (“Our review of the language of SORNA confirms our\nconclusion that Congress cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against\nchildren as possible.”) (emphasis added). Thus, the Third Circuit—and, by\nextension, the District Court—grossly misread Dodge and conjured up a legislative\nhistory for § 3283 that does not exist. If anything, § 3283’s legislative history\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021111.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page64 of ll3\ncorroborates Defendant’s interpretation.

This legislative history\nmakes no mention of crimes, such as Mann Act violations, that do not categorically\ninvolve the actual abuse of minors.\n\nRather than grounding its construction of § 3283 in the text or legislative\nhistory of the statute, the District Court relied almost exclusively on an inapposite\ndecision from this Court, Weingarten v. U.S., 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2ol7). The\nDistrict Court conceded, as it had to, that Weingarten is not controlling (Al47), but\nit essentially and erroneously treated Weingarten as though it were. The only\nquestion in Weingarten was whether the petitioner’s trial counsel provided\nconstitutionally deficient representation by conceding that an indictment charging\nMann Act violations was timely. See 865 F.3d at 52. The petitioner contended\nthat his trial counsel should have argued that § 3283 must be interpreted under a\ncategorical standard. See id. at 58. This Court disagreed only because “/i/t was\nnot obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it today, that a\ncourt must apply a categorical approach, rather than a fact-specific analysis, to\ndetermine whether an offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.” Id. at 58-59\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021113.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page66 of ll3\n\nU.S. v.

In Coutentos, a jury found the defendant guilty on two\ncounts: sexual exploitation or atempted sexual exploitation of a minor to produce\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography (l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) and (d)) and possession or atempted\npossession of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography (l8 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2)). Both\ncounts were untimely unless § 3283 applied. As the Court’s recitation of the facts\nmade clear, the production and possession counts were based on the same\nunderlying conduct: the defendant’s abuse of his granddaughters to create <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\npormography. See Coutentos, 65l F.3d at 8l3-l4. Thus, in a factual sense, the\ndefendant’s possession clearly involved the sexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>. Nevertheless,\nthe Eighth Circuit, while affirming the production conviction, vacated the\npossession conviction on the ground that it was not an “offense involving the\nsexual...abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” within the precise meaning of § 3283. The Court\nconsidered the possession statute in the abstract, asked whether it necessarily\nrequired proof of involvement in the sexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, and concluded that it\ndoes not:\n\nDoes someone who merely possesses <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography sexually\n\nabuse the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> portrayed in the images?

To determine whether the defendant’s offenses were\n“offense[s] involving the sexual...abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” under § 3283, the Court looked\nnot to the facts of the case but, rather, “the language of the relevant statutes.”\nDiehl, 775 F.3d at 72o. The Court expressly cited Coutentos and held that §\n225l(a) was an “offense involving the sexual ... abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,” as the statute\n“prohibits using or inducing children under the age of l8 to engage in sexually\nexplicit conduct for the purpose of creating a visual depiction.” /d.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n: Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021206.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O33 3536o38, Page34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 348\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher. Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual exploitation and abuse.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021216.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OED 3536o38, Page44 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 42 of 348\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.!°\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!° Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. ‘7\nI. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nIs Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\ni As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021218.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N44 3536o38, Page46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021224.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N5o 3536o38, Paged2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\n\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*° According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafafia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021225.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey as ee 3536o38, Paged3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021230.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pageds of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for ‘“‘a sense of the direction where we are headed-l.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’””*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafafia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n44 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021231.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Oa 3536o38, Paged9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 57 of 348\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.” Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.48 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair .. . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\n4 Dershouitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021234.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 6o 3536o38, Page62 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 348\nOn that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than. . . everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\n\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can rightly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age’—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”*”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he ‘“wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n52 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l234", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021236.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6D 3536o38, Page64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\n\ndamages.°°? During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021245.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page73 of 258\nSA-7l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

With\nrespect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say\nthat disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the\nforgoten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified\nas a lapse in judgment.

If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”\n\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\n\nB. Villafaia Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\n\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\n\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\nas Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n\n7l Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l245", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation often possessed <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n4 Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\na The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021253.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Sey, ae 3536o38, Page8l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 348\nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\na Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalm Beach County State Atorney’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, in violation of Fl.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l282", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021302.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l38 3536o38, Pagel3o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have ...a lot of victims... lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\nso we stopped the interview.\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\nspend a significant time in jail.\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nTel Villatafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou.

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\nIX. FEBRUARY - JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.!©? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nto On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillatfafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021306.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcern,” including the follouing:\n\n“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; l\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. ‘©\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office .. . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\nl6s In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021312.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON B38. 3536o38, Pagel4o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 348\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes. ‘7°\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last!

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask.

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l428", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021440.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 564 3536o39, Pagelo of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” *”’ The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail.

Villatfafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l44o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021465.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page35 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 289 of 348\nB.

In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84).

(Tr.3o6-l5, 3l9-28, ll83-88,\n2o84-88).2\n\nIn the later phase of the scheme, from 2ool through\n2oo4, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls\nwho recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm\nBeach residence.

(A.l96 (concluding that, “like § 3283, § 3299\napplies retroactively to offenses for which the previous\nlimitations period has not yet run’)).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021703.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page56 of 93\n43\nin fact sexually abused when transported across state\nlines, including to New York, as a minor. Instead, Max-\nwell insists that Counts Three and Four do not involve\nsexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> because a completed sex act is\nnot an element of those crimes.

Counts Three and Four Are Offenses\nInvolving the Sexual Abuse of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">Child</span>\n\nMaxwell’s entire argument is based on a mistaken\npremise: that the phrase “offense involving the sexual\n... abuse ... of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, only encom-\npasses crimes in which “unlawful sexual activity actu-\nally took place.” (Br.44). This flawed proposition ig-\nnores relevant statutory definitions, which make clear\nthat Section 3283 reaches more broadly to include of-\nfenses in which there was no completed illegal sex act.\n\nAs described above, Section 3283 was originally\ncodified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k). The definition of the\nterm “sexual abuse” is located within that same sec-\ntion:\n\nFor purposes of this section ... the term\n‘sexual abuse’ includes the employment,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement,\n\nll Maxwell raises no analogous argument with re-\nspect to Count Six, which charges sex trafficking of a\nminor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021704.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page57 of 93\n44\n\nor coercion of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to engage in, or as-\n\nsist another person to engage in, sexually\n\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation,\n\nprostitution, or other form of sexual ex-\n\nploitation of children, or incest with chil-\n\ndren.\nl8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). The term “sexually explicit con-\nduct” is in turn defined to mean, among other things,\n“sexual intercourse, including sexual contact”; and the\nterm “sexual contact” means “the intentional touching,\neither directly or through clothing, of the genitalia,\nanus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or butocks of any per-\nson with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, de-\ngrade, or arouse or gratify sexual desire of any person.”\nId. § 35o9(a)(9)(A). Courts have looked to the defini-\ntion of “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a) to\ndetermine whether the statute of limitations of Section\n3283 applies to an offense. United States v. Carpenter,\n68o F.3d llol, llo3-o4 (9th Cir. 2ol2) (‘We join our\nsister circuits in looking to subsection 35o9(a) for a def-\ninition of ‘sexual abuse’ under federal law, and find it\nthe appropriate definition to use in applying section\n3283's extended statute of limitations.”).\n\nThe definition of “sexual abuse” includes not only\nactual “sexual contact,” but also the “the employment,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to engage in, or assist another person to en-\ngage in,” sexual contact. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a). The\nbreadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s\nuse of the word “includes” in Section 35o9(a)’s text,\nwhich is “significant because it makes clear that the\nexamples enumerated in the text are intended to be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021705.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page58 of 93\n45\n\nillustrative, not exhaustive.” Christopher  v.\nSmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. l42, l62 (2ol2)\n(citing Burgess v. United States, 552 U.S. l24, l3l n.3\n(2oo8)). And the text of Section 3283 goes even further\nbeyond the definition provided in Section 35o9 by cov-\nering any crime “involving” the sexual abuse of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.\nCongress therefore did not require that a particular\nstatute have actual sexual contact with a minor as an\nelement of its offense, but rather swept broadly to\ncover any crime that in any way involves sexual abuse\nas broadly defined. Given this expansive language,\nsexual abuse “as defined here encompasses a wider set\nof behavior than just rape or other unwanted sexual\ntouching.” United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl97 (8d Cir. 2ol5). Thus, courts throughout the coun-\ntry have concluded that Section 3283 applies to a vari-\nety of offenses that do not require “a sexual act be-\ntween a defendant and a specific <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,” United States\nv. Vickers, No. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA), 2ol4 WL l838255, at\n*ll (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4), or “physical contact with\nthe victim,” Carpenter, 68o F.3d at llo3; accord\nUnited States v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 7l4, 72o (5th Cir.\n2ol5).\n\nSection 3283’s definition thus captures crimes of in-\ntent where a perpetrator seeks to have a minor engage\nin sexual contact even if such sexual contact does not\noccur. Transportation of a minor with intent to engage\nin an illegal sex act (as charged in Count Four) and\nconspiracy to commit the same (as charged in Count\nThree) fall comfortably within that definition. Even\nthough a completed sex act is not required to commit\nthose two crimes, Count Four has “sexual abuse” as an\nelement because it requires the defendant to\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021706.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page59 of 93\n46\n\n“induce[]” a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> to engage in illegal sexual activity\nby transporting the minor across state lines with in-\ntent that the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> engage in an illegal sex act, l8\nU.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8), and Count Three, as a conspiracy\nto commit Count Four, is an “offense involving [such]\nsexual ... abuse,” id. § 3283.

(Br.43). But as this Court has al-\nready recognized, Section 3283's text “reaches beyond\nthe offense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘in-\nvolv[ed]’ in the offense”—a “linguistic expansion” that\nshous Congress’s intent for “courts to look beyond the\nbare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 ap-\nplied.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59-6o; see also Niyha-\nwan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (holding that\na statute that includes an “offense ... involves” phrase\nis “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach”).\nIndeed, the Third Circuit has expressly rejected an\n““assential ingredient’ test” comparable to the categor-\nical approach and instead applied case-specific analy-\nsis to determine that Section 3283 applied to travel\nwith intent to commit an illegal sex act with a minor,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b). Schneider, 8ol F.3d\nat l96-97.\n\nMaxwell also argues that “the clear weight of au-\nthority” holds that statutes employing similar lan-\nguage “should be read through a categorical rather\nthan case-specific lens.” (Br.44-45). But the decisions\nshe cites involved statutes with other features favoring\nthe categorical approach, which are notably absent\nhere. Some cases involved statutes that defined a\n“crime of violence” as an offense that either “has as an\nelement” the use of physical force or “by its nature” in-\nvolves a substantial risk of force—language that in-\nvokes an elements-based approach.

In Bridges, the Supreme Court “applied an\n‘essential ingredient’ test to determine whether an of-\nfense qualified for a provision ... that extended the\ncriminal limitations period for certain fraud offenses.”\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 n.lo. But as this Court has\nexplained, “Bridges is distinguishable” because the Su-\npreme Court “there believed applying the restrictive\n‘essential ingredient’ test to determine if an offense ‘in-\nvolv[ed] the defrauding of the United States’ effectu-\nated Congress’s specific intent to limit the ... extended\nlimitations period to only a few offenses,” while “Con-\ngress had the opposite intention for § 3283.” Id.

As discussed above, an “offense involving the\nsexual... abuse... of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, must\nbe read in light of the definition of “sexual abuse” set\nforth in Section 35o9(a), which encompasses a wide\nrange of conduct that is not limited to actual sexual\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021709.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page62 of 93\n49\ncontact with a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.

Nieves turned\non the court’s failure to explore juror bias related to gangs — a prejudice analogous\nto the systematic or pervasive bias in the community against accused sex traffickers\nand those who consort with them. Maxwell, tied to Epstein by media coverage, went\nto trial against a constant drumbeat of news and allegations concerning <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nmolesters and sex trafficking.

In the hearing, and despite defense suggested\nquestions, the Court refused to explore Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual abuse for bias.\n\nTo assess a challenge for cause as to this seated juror after trial the court\nshould use the same standards for cause challenges at trial. To do otherwise would\nappear to shield the verdict rather than the defendant from improper juror bias. As\nin Nieves, the juror’s omited information related to a “material issue” that was at\ntrial “the cornerstone of the government’s theory.” There was a strong likelihood\nthat the material issue would skew deliberations considering the strong feelings that\nsex trafficking of minors engenders. See Nieves; see also Barnes, 6o4 F.2d at l37-\nl39.

The Indictment Is Timely\n\nMaxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment\nare untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and\nthereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided\nby § 3283.l9 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot\napply the 2oo3 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of\nlimitations to those offenses that were commited before the enactment\ninto law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that\nthe District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the\ncharges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to\ndismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.”°\n\nFirst, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly\napplied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that\nCongress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific\n© l8 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nunder the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, or for\nten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”\n2o United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n2l 865 F.3d 48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7); see also United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d 299, 3l3-\nl4 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l).\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l89l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021893.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l2l-2, l2/o2/2o24, 363774l, Pagel6 of 26\nstatute as it is writen.” If the statute “is ambiguous or contains no\nexpress command regarding retroactivity, a reviewing court must\ndetermine whether applying the statute to antecedent conduct would\ncreate presumptively impermissible retroactive effects.”\n\nHere, the inquiry is straightforward. In 2oo3, Congress\namended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would\notherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under the age of l8 years shall\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>.”*° The text of\n§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it\nprevent the application of any statute of limitations that would\notherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nThe statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend\nthe time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as\nthe prior statute of limitations was inadequate. This is enough to\nconclude that the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 applies to\nMaxwell’s conduct as charged in the Indictment.\n\n24 In re Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.

Judge Torres:\n\nPursuant to the Court’s request, I am making a writen request that the April 2o, 2o2o\ntrial date be adjourned for at least 6 months. Firstly, the government in this mater sent out\ndiscovery on or about December 3l, 2ol9. It was received in my office over the holiday break\nwhen no one was working. Thereafter, there was an issue with me being able to access the drive\ncontaining all of the information proffered by the government because we were given the wrong\npassword by the government. Accordingly, I have had only about two weeks to review the\nvoluminous discovery provided.\n\nThe discovery ostensibly contains approximately 25,ooo documents and hundreds of\nhours of video footage. In order to effectively represent my client, I will need at least an\nadditional 6o days to review the discovery and discuss it with my client. Thereafter, I will still\nneed to conduct an investigation based on the information and witness statements detailed in the\ndiscovery. Such an undertaking will take at the minimum another 6o days. As the Court can see,\nit will take me 9o days or more before I am in a position to knou what additional discovery may\nbe needed or what motions are appropriate. Additionally, this timeline doesn’t even account for\nissues regarding subpoenas, requests for additional discovery and atempting to locate witnesses\nor hire experts.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l996", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021997.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 2l Filed ol/27/2o Page2of2\n\ny—— | he Law Offices of\n\n=a!

Teams of agents, analysts,\natorneys, and privacy and civil liberties experts combed through the digital and documentary\nevidence with the aim of providing as much information as possible to the public while\nsimultaneously protecting victims. Much of the material is subject to court-ordered sealing. Only\na fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal\nserved only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of\nillegal wrongdoing. Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those\nmaterials and will not permit the release of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography.\n\nThis systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.”” There was also no credible\nevidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not\nuncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\n\nConsistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one\nthousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is\nintertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and\nlikenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment history.\n\nOne of our highest priorities is combating <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation and bringing justice to\nvictims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\n\nTo that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information\nregarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is\nthe determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no\nfurther disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022416.jpg": "Page 24\nl himself had told me that they were not together.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n° In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023054.jpg": "other things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.’\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\n\" As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023056.jpg": "2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2 Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023062.jpg": "disagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023068.jpg": "he is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafaia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023069.jpg": "we are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.” Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.*° On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\n‘te Dershouitz had jomed Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o69", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023072.jpg": "On that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than... everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\n\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can rightly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”~\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n% Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023074.jpg": "damages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\nae State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh <span class=\"highlight\">Child</span> Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o74", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023083.jpg": "proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. | stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafania Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\na Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.jpg": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation often possessed <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\n\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”\n\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\n\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\n\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\n\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\n\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\n\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\n\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\n\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\n\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\n\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\n\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\n\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\n\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\n\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nie The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023091.jpg": "CONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\ni Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalm Beach County State Atorney’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>, in violation of Fl.

Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023140.jpg": "that it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023144.jpg": "appeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'®° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.jpg": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.7** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.jpg": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed.

Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that ““we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n255 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of mterstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n258 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort. . ..\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.jpg": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?””\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\nAaT Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n28 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023256.jpg": "review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel.

Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”34°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, /n re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nme The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23266", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023276.jpg": "l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”!

With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States.

Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list.

By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps.

The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced fo collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions fo the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned.

Yet victims told police they had no massage\niraining.}\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, ouner\nof the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlosida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npatern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of l7, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.}\nBrunel is a 5o-plus French playboy who was formerly part ouner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency.

He hired a squad of\nlawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,\nlocal detectives pressed on and brought the mater to the atention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal\ncolleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the\nuse of inferstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2ooo Trafficking Victims\nProtection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 2o years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2oo2.)\nSo when State Atorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo\nmount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the\natorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.\nHe did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting\nprostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was\nTeturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.\nThe details that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,\naccording to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three l2-year-old girls from France, who were molested\nthen floun back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,\nEurope, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency ouned by Jean Luc\nBrunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $l million from the billionaire around ‘\nthe time he started the agency.\nThe non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four\nmembers of his staff were investigated for “knouingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that person has not yet obtained the age of l8 years and would be\ncaused fo engage in commercial sex act\"—that is, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex trafficking. Yet the agreement alloued Epstein to plead\nguilty to only two louer-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for prostitution.\nAlthough the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against\nEpstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,\nand that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil\nlawsuits. Atorney Dershouitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay atorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage\nclaims—without admiting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”\nBut exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there\nwere several earlier versions of the U.S Atorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been\nconvicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 2o years. Brad Edwards, atorney for seven of the victims, confirms\nthe existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that\n\nEpstein “commited, at some point, to a lo-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s fegal team refused that\n\n| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a\njury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Atorney's Office, which shared the state atorney's view\n\nthat the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.\n\nFor one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran lawyers,\n\nwhose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton’s relationship with an intern, would play rough.\n\n| Wien the Paim Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershouitz\n\n| began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. ;\n\n: Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershouitz had launched background\n\n| checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershouitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and\n\n| Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knouing whe ordered It.\n\n| And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being folloued and intimidated by\n\neee o3956-l225\nhtp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029045.jpg": "+» -* Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire oe Goes Free - The Daily Beast 2 Page 4 of 4\n|\n| private investigators who were then linked to local atorneys in Epsiein’s employ. jn one reporied instance, the private\n| investigator claimed to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges.\n| The credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they\n: were contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of\n7 the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n7 of l8 commits @ felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberio Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.

See, N.Y. Corr. Law §§ l68-\n\nl(2)(a)(l), (d), (3), In spite of the statutory reference to “essential elements,” some New York\n\ncourts have looked at the facts underlying the offense of conviction, rather than the formal 3\nelements of the offense, in determining whether registration is required. Each finding that a :\ndefendant was required to register on the basis of the underlying conduct even though the i\nessential elements test was not satisfied. See, People v. Burden, 6 Mise.3d lo33(a)(Sup. Ct. i\nBronx Cty. 2oo5); Pegple v. Millan, l89 Misc.2d 4l9, 73o N.¥.S.2d 392 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty. j\n2ool).\n\nThe same serious concem arises in other states, including California and Colorado, which\nauthorize courts to look behind the plea, and beyond the formal elements of the offense of\nconviction, and enable them on a case by case basis to determine if registration is required. i\n\nLike New York, California requires an individual to register if they are required to register i\nin the state of conviction, or pursuant to CA Penal Code § 29o(a)(2)(D)() if that individual “, . . :\nsince July l, l944, has been, or is hereafter convicted in any other court, including any state, '\nfederal, or military court, of any offense that, if commited or atempted in this state, would have\nbeen punishable as one or more of the offenses described in subparagraph (A)”. The wording of :\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at ,\nthe forma] elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” where the i\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>” “with i\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that :\nperson or the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>”, CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may '\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving j\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare requited to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A, §§ l6-22-lo3, |\nl6-22-lo8.\n\nWith regard to Florida, as you knou, it is reasonably clear that under Florida’s current |\nversion of Megan’s Law, a plea to aggravated assault would not subject the client to registration 5\nin Florida since it is not included among the state’s enumerated “sexual offender” offenses.

I have to say in this instance, your\noffice along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not\nadequately punishing a chronic <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molester and rapist. This man of wealth and\nprestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He\nlived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the\ncorrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be\nfacing the death penalty. Hou can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of\ngirls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and nou be a free man?! Hou?!! Because he is\nrich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these\ngirls makes me sick. Nou, I understand the pressure of taking on a pouerful person with\nunlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is beter than\nnone can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor\ndid you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your\noffice could have put this monster away for at least 2o years, if not life.\n\nI’m sure you have read Conchita Sarnoff’s piece on the Daily Beast detailing this\nmonsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as\na cautionary tale on hou not to prosecute a rich <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuser and human trafficker. Nou,\nI do not knou the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, hou much hush’\nmoney was paid out, ect ect. But I do knou that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have\nraped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn’t be alloued to do the\nsame thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you\nlegally could have to put this man in prison. Houever after researching the case, it seems\nyou failed to come doun with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA’s\noffice and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good!\nIt would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the\n\njustice system, especially <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose\nto defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your litle sister\nor daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American\npeople deserve beter, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the\nanger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the\nwhole DA’s office nee“ to knou this- that monster doesn’t deserve freedom!\n\n-A Concerned Patriot\n\np.s.

Children in\nhis classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of\nwealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been\nexposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and\nuniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As\nmaters would turn out, Jeffrey’s experience at the Dalton School would become life-\naltering on a number of different jevels.\nAs Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to atend an art\ngallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached\nby a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially\ntalented mathematics teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working\non Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even knou where Wall Street\n° was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns.\nDuring his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admited that he did not\nknou what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea\nchange in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively\nbased valuation. Based on Jeffrey’s mathematics aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a\njob on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year.\nJeffrey utilized his mathematics expertise in becoming an adept options trader,\nand came to knou a number of successful investors. His success in the position is\nreflected in the fact that by l98o he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm.\nBelieving, houever, that he could do beter on his oun on the outside, he decided to\nresign from Bear Stearns in l98l. Capitalizing on his knouledge of and experience\ninvesting in esoteric financial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to\n; the unique family and financial problems of the “hyper-rich” gained from his experience\n| at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein &\n\nCompany (nou Financial Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family advisor to the\n\n“hyper-rich.” The services he provides consist of a broad array of financial advice (on\n\ninvestment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the\n\n2\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033223.jpg": "client’s family office. The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033226.jpg": "When it became clear, houever, that the demands of Jeffrey’s life could not\ninclude staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no\nfuture as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three\nchildren. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly\nevery day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen times or so\nin the 26 years they have knoun each other. She described their current relationship as\nfollous:\n\nToday [Jeffrey] is a very close and important friend to my family. He is\nthe godfather of my three children and is close friend of my husband as\nwell. Whenever Jeffrey is in New York, he will always come over in the\nevening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and\nconduct science QO & A at the dinner table. He will always remember the\nchildren’s birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational\ngames for the kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Jeffrey\nwas extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could\nnot ask for a beter friend or godfather to my children.\n. Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, l2. Celina wrote\nglouingly of their weekly science lesson when “Uncle Jeff,” as she calls him, takes time\n: from his personal and business schedule to go over to her apartment and discuss science\nand mathematics lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for\nexample, as why the sky is blue or hou fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they\nthen spend some time at the piano where “Uncle Jeff’ helps her work on her singing\nvoice (even though, as she knous, “Uncle Jeff’ does not have any real expertise in this\narea). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, houever, by an\nincident Celina related in her leter:\nOne of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2\nyears ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter\ndance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I\ndidn’t knou what I would do because you had to bring your father to the\ndance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone\ncall to Unele Jeff didn’t leave me standing there, alone for more than lo\nminutes. Uncle Jeff substituted for my father that night, and the way he\nrushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there.\n\nAfter Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey\nentered into another significant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning\n6\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033227.jpg": "in l99l, Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of\nher life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-knoun publisher, had been found dead\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship\nimmediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.\n\n, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,\nand he never alloued her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical\nthings he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies —\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concerns. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\ndepression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep depression.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to\ngive it back. These gifts are meant to allou the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey\nfinds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which\nshe subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.\n\nOver time, their relationship became intimate. Houever, as with Eva, it ended\namicably around 2ooo upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,\ni.e., the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,\nprecluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this\nday. She wrote of their relationship:\n\nMy experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man,\nwith a keen sense of humor and a ready smile — a man of principles and\nvalues and a man of his word. If he made a promise, he would always\nfollou through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise. He is\n7\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033229.jpg": "gifts to be anonymous. Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the .\nspotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.\nJeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the\nInstitute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe\nhaven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such\nplaces as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors\nover the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the\nStockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were\nthe original sponsors and creators of “The Prize for Promise,” a national award program\ndesigned to “identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,\ncourage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of\nendeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s\ngenerosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former\nPresident Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the\n: room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate\ndegree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton\n, Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New\nYork where they are expected to graduate in 2oo8.\nJeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness\norganizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer\nResearch Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the\nContinuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and\nthe Center for Health and Healing.\nJeffrey has also been a long time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in\nboth New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a\nmajor contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in\nNew York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty\n: fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money\nto literally dozens of civic organizations in need.

This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical insurance.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033234.jpg": "different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as financial,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have.

Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters, Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but\nhas been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,\neducational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,\n\nand civic groups.

The Supreme Court in Bridges\naddressed a statute that extended the limitations\nperiod for defrauding the United States during the\nSecond World War.

Instead of simply\nproviding a new limitations period for future conduct,\nCongress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses\nwill apply. That is, it prevents the application of any\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise apply to\npast conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other\nstatutes employing similar language. The Eighth\nCircuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283,\nwhich alloued prosecution of sex crimes against\nchildren until the victim reached age twenty-five,\napplied to past conduct. See United States v. Jeffries,\n4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second\nCircuit has observed that the Higher Education\nTechnical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L.

Instead, she contends that because the House\nversion of the bill included an express retroactivity\nprovision absent from its final form, the Court should\ninfer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply\nto past conduct. Houever, the legislative history makes\nclear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have\nproduced unconstitutional results.

Houever, it also concludes\nthat even if the statute were ambiguous, it would\nproperly apply to these charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether\napplication of the statute to past conduct would have\nimpermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has\npresumptively impermissible retroactive effects when\nit ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a\nnew duty, or ataches a new disability, in respect to\ntransactions or considerations already past.” Weingarten,\n865 F.3d at 56 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o).\nThus, applying a new statute of limitations to pre-\nviously time-barred claims has an impermissible\nretroactive effect. Enter. Moritg. Acceptance Co., LLC,\nSec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for\nwhich the statute of limitations has not yet expired\ndoes not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within\nthe statute of limitations when Congress enacted the\nPROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any\nvested rights. Maxwell contends that it is unfair to\nallou the Government to prosecute her nou for\nconduct that occurred more than twenty years ago, but\nthere is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set\na lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at\nall. It has done so here, judging that the difficulty of\nprosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on\nchildren outweighs a defendant’s interest in repose.\nMaxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s\npolicy judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive\napplication of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool33", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000137.tif": "74a\n\n(2d Cir. l975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a\ndefendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to\nidentify with sufficient particularity the nature of\nthe charge pending against him, thereby enabling\ndefendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and\nto interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United\nStates v. Bortnovusky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of\neach charged crime and the facts supporting each\nelement. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the\nindictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended\ntime periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does\nnot identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the\nGovernment need only describe the time and place of\ncharged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti,\n5l3 F.2d at ll8.

Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)).\n“This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of\nchildren: allegations of sexual abuse of underage\nvictims often proceed without specific dates of the\noffenses.” United States v. Young, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK),\n2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8)\n(collecting cases).

But the record\nis clear in any event that the NPA was signed on behalf\nof the United States Atorney for the Southern District\nof Florida, who was heavily involved in the negotiation\nand approval process.

It does not inform the outcome here,\nhouever, despite the government’s heavy reliance on it\nagreements to limit their scope when that is what they intend,\nand the burden is on them to be specific.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance.

CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n° In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023054.tif": "other things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.’\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nl5 Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023056.tif": "2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023062.tif": "disagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o62", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023063.tif": "of the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023068.tif": "he is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafaia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n“4 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023072.tif": "On that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than... everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\n\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes identified by you can rightly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”~\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n% Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023074.tif": "damages.°> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA.

If our personality differences\nthreaten their access to justice, then please put someone on the case\nwhom you trust more, and who will also protect their rights.\nIn the meantime, I will be meeting with the agents on Monday to\nbegin preparing a revised indictment package containing your\nsuggestions on the indictment and responding to the issues raised by\nEpstein’s atorneys. ... If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”°\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.”! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafania Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n7o Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\nn Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.tif": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation often possessed <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\nR In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\n\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”\n\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\n\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\n\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\n\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\n\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\n\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\n\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\n\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\n\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\n\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\n\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\n\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\n\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\n\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n™ Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nl% The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023120.tif": "At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafatia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor. . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023140.tif": "that it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have .. . a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®* Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General.

After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “<span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023144.tif": "appeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!*’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims.

The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v.

The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023208.tif": "successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.tif": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.tif": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\n<span class=\"highlight\">child</span> pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation.

This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n258 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23276", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023301.tif": "B. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*!?\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023336.tif": "signature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local atorneys,\ntold police that Epstein also gave $loo,ooo to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate”\nabout massages being “therapeutically and spiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage\niraining.}\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, ouner\nof the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlorida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npatern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of l7, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.}\nBrunel is a 5o-plus French playboy who was formerly part ouner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency.

(The remaining l5 percent is ouned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been observed as a house guest at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New York, where Epstein ouns a lavish\nhome—the city’s largest private residence—and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartmeni on elegant Ave. Fach.\n\nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated MC2 for a 6o Minutes broadcast several years ago, is quated in Michael\nGross’ book about the modeling industry, Bad and Beautiful. Pyes told the author that Brunel “ranks among the\nsleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls\nwere not only harassed but molested.” Nou The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $l million wire\ntransfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in September 2oo4, just as he was seting up MC2. Whether this was a gift\nor a loan or a backdoor investment in the new venture is unknoun. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving\nevidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April af\nBrunel's activities, Epstein said “I'm loo percent convinced that he doesn’t traffic children.” (Brunel has never been\ncharged.} .\nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very beautiful; many\nwere from Eastern Europe and spoke litle English.

He hired a squad of\nlawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,\nlocal detectives pressed on and brought the mater to the atention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal\ncolleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the\nuse of interstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2ooo Trafficking Victims\nProtection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 2o years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2oo2.)\nSo when State Atorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo\nmount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the\natorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.\nHe did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting\nprostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was\nTeturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.\nThe detais that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,\naccording to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three l2-year-old girls from France, who were molested\nthen floun back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,\nEurope, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency ouned by Jean Luc\nBrunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $l million from the billionaire around .\nthe time he started the agency.\nThe non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four\nmembers of his staff were investigated for “knouingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that person has not yet obtained the age of l8 years and would be\ncaused fo engage in commercial sex act\"—that is, <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> sex trafficking. Yet the agreement alloued Epstein to plead\nguilty to only two louer-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> for prostitution.\nAlthough the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against\nEpstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,\nand that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil\nlawsuits. Atorney Dershouitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay atorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage\nclaims—without admiting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”\nBut exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there\nwere several earlier versions of the U.S Atorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been\nconvicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 2o years. Brad Edwards, atorney for seven of the victims, confirms\nthe existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that\n\nEpstein “commited, at some point, to a lo-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s legal team refused that\n\n| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a\njury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Atorney's Office, which shared the state atorney's view\n\nthat the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.\n\nFor one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran fawyers,\n\nwhose cases ranged from O.J.

Many of\n: the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epsiein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n: of l8 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the <span class=\"highlight\">child</span>-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.

He\nappears to relish the company of super-rich oil billionaires from the Middie East, North Africa and the\nformer Soviet Union.\nThe peculiar sale of his former marital home to a Kazakh businessman for £l5 million after it had\nlanguished unsold for five years at £l2 million has never been satisfactorily explained.\nIn the recent leak of American diplomatic cables it was revealed that he had criticised an official\ncorruption investigation into the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, while he\nis also said to be close to Saif Al-lslam Gaddafi, son of the beleaguered Libyan president, and may have\nhad a role in the early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrati.\nWhile on the streets, I slept with men for money. |\n' t\n\nwas a paedophile's dream\nBut it is Andrew's friendship with Epstein, whom he has knoun since at least 2ooo, and with Epstein’s\nconfidante Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late disgraced newspaper baron Robert Maxwell, that\ngives most concern.\nHe was first seen with the pair on holiday in Thailand, and was pictured cavorting with Ghislaine at a\nHalloueen fetishthemed party in Manhatan.\nThe photograph that appeared last weekend shous the prince strolling through Central Park with 58-\nyear-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in December, when\nhe was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner.\nit is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has atended as Epstein’s guest.\nA lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was a\nquest at a cocktail party throun by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models. ‘Some\nguests were horrified,’ said the article’s author, Vicky Ward.\nIt should not be forgoten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his sentence\nfor offences relating to <span class=\"highlight\">child</span> prostitution.\nHouever, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one\n\n| reading The Mail on Sunday's interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can be\n\n| in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges.\n\n| Epstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his\n\n| friends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2oo5 after the stepmother of a l4-year old\n\n| girl claimed she was paid $2oo (£l25) to give him an ‘erotic massage’.\n\n| The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 2o girls levelling sexual allegations against him.\n\n: Eventually, Epstein struck a ‘plea bargain’ with prosecutors — a practice not permited under British law —\nunder which he was alloued to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.\n\n. o3956-l274\nhtp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie... 3/l6/2oll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029061.tif": "_,  » Prince Andrew and girl, l7, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Mail...

Children in\nhis classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of\nwealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been\nexposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and\nuniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As\nmaters would turn out, Jeffrey’s experience at the Dalton School would become life-\naltering on a number of different jevels.\nAs Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to atend an art\ngallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached\nby a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially\ntalented mathematics teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working\non Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even knou where Wall Street\n° was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns.\nDuring his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admited that he did not\nknou what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea\nchange in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively\nbased valuation. Based on Jeffrey’s mathematics aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a\njob on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year.\nJeffrey utilized his mathematics expertise in becoming an adept options trader,\nand came to knou a number of successful investors. His success in the position is\nreflected in the fact that by l98o he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm.\nBelieving, houever, that he could do beter on his oun on the outside, he decided to\nresign from Bear Stearns in l98l. Capitalizing on his knouledge of and experience\ninvesting in esoteric financial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to\n; the unique family and financial problems of the “hyper-rich” gained from his experience\n| at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein &\n\nCompany (nou Financial Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family advisor to the\n\n“hyper-rich.” The services he provides consist of a broad array of financial advice (on\n\ninvestment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the\n\n2\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033223.tif": "client’s family office. The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033226.tif": "When it became clear, houever, that the demands of Jeffrey’s life could not\ninclude staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no\nfuture as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three\nchildren. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly\nevery day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen times or so\nin the 26 years they have knoun each other. She described their current relationship as\nfollous:\n\nToday [Jeffrey] is a very close and important friend to my family. He is\nthe godfather of my three children and is close friend of my husband as\nwell. Whenever Jeffrey is in New York, he will always come over in the\nevening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and\nconduct science QO & A at the dinner table. He will always remember the\nchildren’s birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational\ngames for the Kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Jeffrey\nwas extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could\nnot ask for a beter friend or godfather to my children.\n. Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, l2. Celina wrote\nglouingly of their weekly science lesson when “Uncle Jeff,” as she calls him, takes time\n: from his personal and business schedule to go over to her apartment and discuss science\nand mathematics lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for\nexample, as why the sky is blue or hou fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they\nthen spend some time at the piano where “Uncle Jeff’ helps her work on her singing\nvoice (even though, as she knous, “Uncle Jeff’ does not have any real expertise in this\narea). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, houever, by an\nincident Celina related in her leter:\nOne of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2\nyears ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter\ndance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I\ndidn’t knou what I would do because you had to bring your father to the\ndance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone\ncall to Unele Jeff didn’t leave me standing there, alone for more than lo\nminutes. Uncle Jeff substituted for my father that night, and the way he\nrushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there.\n\nAfter Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey\nentered into another significant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning\n6\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033227.tif": "in l99l, Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of\nher life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-knoun publisher, had been found dead\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship\nimmediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.\n\n, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,\nand he never alloued her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical\nthings he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies ~\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concems. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\ndepression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep depression.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to\ngive it back. These gifts are meant to allou the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey\nfinds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which\nshe subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.\n\nOver time, their relationship became intimate. Houever, as with Eva, it ended\namicably around 2ooo upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,\ni.e. the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,\nprecluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this\nday. She wrote of their relationship:\n\nMy experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man,\nwith a keen sense of humor and a ready smile — a man of principles and\nvalues and a man of his word. If he made a promise, he would always\nfollou through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise. He is\n7\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033229.tif": "gifts to be anonymous. Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the .\nspotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.\nJeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the\nInstitute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe\nhaven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such\nplaces as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors\nover the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the\nStockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were\nthe original sponsors and creators of “The Prize for Promise,” a national award program\ndesigned to “identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,\ncourage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of\nendeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s\ngenerosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former\nPresident Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the\n: room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate\ndegree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton\n, Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New\nYork where they are expected to graduate in 2oo8.\nJeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness\norganizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer\nResearch Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the\nContinuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and\nthe Center for Health and Healing.\nJeffrey has also been a Jong time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in\nboth New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a\nmajor contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in\nNew York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty\n: fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money\nto literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational,\n. sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children’s advocacy and\nwomen’s groups. One noteworthy example is the Antilles School in St. Thomas which\n9\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33229", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033232.tif": "Lesley Groff, a personal assistant to Jeffrey, reported a number of\naccommodations Jeffrey has made, i.e., purchase of a vehicle for her\ncommute, extended maternity leave, a reduced work week and permission\nto work from home, which have strengthened her family life.\nLauren Kwintner, another New York City-based employee, told of\naccommodations from 2oo3 to 2oo5 that Jeffrey made for her to atend to\nher father, who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, at both ,\nSloane Ketering Memorial Hospital and subsequently the Hospital for\nJoint Diseases, until his passing.\nBella Klein, also a New York City-based employee, was a single mother\nwhose son was accepted to Cornell University; Jeffrey has paid up to 7o%\nof his tuition expenses; the son nou has his Master’s Degree and is\nworking on his Ph.D.\nHarry Beller, a sixteen-year employee, is an orthodox Jew who is required\nto be home prior to sundoun on Fridays and on al! Jewish holidays.\nJeffrey has always accommodated his religious commitments, on occasion\npermiting pressing Friday transactions to take place on the follouing\nMonday. Mr. Beller also told of Jeffrey’s assistance in making available\nany of his contacts in the medical field and to take any necessary time off\nwhen one of his sons was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma.\nJeffrey has been especially generous in funding the educational pursuits of his\nemployees (and their family members) as a way of assisting them to beter themselves\nand achieve their full potential. Mr. Indyke has writen that over the last six years,\nJeffrey has funded literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to many\nindividuals (some of whom Jeffrey has no connection with whatsoever) from the pre-\nschool to the post-graduate levels. Mr. Beller, mentioned above, for example, has been\nthe recipient of tuition assistance for all six of his children! Another employee, Emad\nHanna, who was hired by Jeffrey at a particularly trying time of his adult life, told of\nJeffrey’s sponsorship of his son’s AAU baseball team and of the tuition assistance for his\nson:\nJeffrey Epstein has paid out of his pocket my son's high school tuition for\n2 years nou totaling around $2o,ooo and has given him the opportunity to\nget a top notch education at a private all boys catholic high school and my\nson has thrived in that environment and averaged a grade of 9l in his\nfreshmen (sic) year and from all the travel baseball experience he was\nable to make the JV basebail team at one of the top schools in New Jersey.\nThis has paved the way for my son to possibly have the opportunity to\nl2\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033233.tif": "atend a college of his choice when the time comes. I would not have been\nable to [do] this if it wasn’t for Mr. Epstein.\nAnother example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is puting\nthrough vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke\nrelated that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and\nmentor Mr. Diaz.\n\nA final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:\n\nWhile working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a\nrelationship with the cleaning man who details our office space. Alfredo\nand I reflect life’s issues and family maters as best fas] a Colombian and\nEnglish speaking friend may, but it takes us deep and a look or gesture\nspeaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken\nEnglish and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter atending\ncollege. Alfredo told me hou proud he is of her atending college. “Me\ndaughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which\nled to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,\nMister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to\nme he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the\ndream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such\nconsequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one\n\n‘ man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical insurance.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033234.tif": "different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as financial,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,\nto meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas\nadoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters. Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but\nhas been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,\neducational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,\n\nand civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them\nl4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33234"};
