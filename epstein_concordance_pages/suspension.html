That\n<span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> persists to this day.* In a case such as this, which will require assessing evidence\nrelating to events that occurred approximately twenty-five years ago, including documents and\npersonal recollections, numerous in-person meetings between counsel and Ms. Maxwell will be\ncritical to the preparation of the defense. The recent resurgence of the pandemic calls into\nquestion whether these meetings will ever be able to happen in advance of her trial.

Mr. Robertson’s trial will nou be reset\nfor April 5, 2o2l, and the Court is hopeful that he will finally get his day in court after the extreme\nand unprecedented delay he has endured. Complicating maters, houever, is the fact that the\npandemic and the resulting passage of time has led to a recent and significant change in Mr.\nRobertson’s defense team: both of his original atorneys withdrew from the case in January of this\nyear.

Although the Court would\nnot have granted the appointments if it were not sure that Mr. Robertson’s new atorneys would be\nready for trial this April, they nevertheless face the daunting task of earning their client’s trust,\npreparing for trial, and reviewing three years’ worth of litigation in a mater of months.\n\nMr. Robertson first asked the Court to consider his release in July of last year.

Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool296\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001358.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/oo8BG+ANAt B6caMeent 4/282 Filed/o7/o5/PagPage 22af 2\nPage 2\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC.\n\nMDC staff conduct two pat-doun searches of the defendant per day: once when she is\nmoved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day\nroom to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched.

MDC staff\nalso conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.\nAt night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen\nminutes. To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the\ncell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes.

Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nEven if the 2oo3 Amendment could be retroactively applied to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct during the l99os, Counts One through Four would still be time-barred for a separate and\nindependent reason: Section 3283 does not apply to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is\ncharged. Section 3283 extends the statute of limitations only for “offense[s] involving the sexual\nor physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, but none\nof the offenses charged in Counts One through Four is such an offense.’\n\nA. Section 3283 applies only to offenses that necessarily entail the sexual or\n\nphysical abuse, or kidnapping, of a child.\n\nA long line of cases establishes that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain\nconduct means an offense that “necessarily requir[es]” that conduct. Shular v. United States, l4o\nS. Ct. 779, 785 (2o2o) (internal quotations omited). Those cases date back at least to Bridges v.\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which construed the Wartime <span class=\"highlight\">Suspension</span> of Limitations\nAct’s extension of statutes of limitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud\nagainst the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 3287 (l95o) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held\nthat that extension was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud\nthe United States is an essential ingredient of the offense charged.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 22l.\nThus, the Court held that charges that the defendant knouingly made and conspired to make\nfalse statements in a naturalization proceeding, and that he aided and abeted a fraudulent\ncertificate of naturalization, were subject to the general statute of limitations and not the\nexception, because “fraud is not an essential ingredient” of such offenses, and “[t]he offense is\ncomplete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it.” Jd. at 222.\n\n’ The words “or kidnaping” were added as part of the 2oo3 Amendment. 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 25\n\nSuch a “necessarily entails” or “elements of the offense” approach is particularly\nappropriate for three additional reasons here. First, like the Wartime <span class=\"highlight\">Suspension</span> Act in Bridges,\n§ 3283 creates an “exception” to the general five-year limitations period of § 3282, and such\nexceptions should be “narrouly construed.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-l6 (citing United States v.\nMcElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639 (l926)); see also Comm ’r v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (l989) (“we\nusually read the exception narrouly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision,”\nparticularly when the exception is “somewhat ambiguous”). Second, § 3282 itself requires that\nany exception to the five-year rule be “expressly provided by law.” l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (emphasis\nadded). Nouhere does § 3283 “expressly” purport to cover offenses that could (but need not) be\nproved by facts involving sexual or physical abuse of a minor. And third, under the rule of\nlenity, ambiguity with respect to criminal statutes should be construed in favor of the defendant.\nBurrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4); see also United States v. Valle, 8o7 F.3d\n5o8, 523 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“where, as here, the Government and the defense both posit plausible\ninterpretations of a criminal statute, the rule of lenity requires us to adopt the defendant’s\nconstruction”). To do otherwise would violate the “longstanding congressional ‘policy of\nrepose’ that is fundamental to our society and our criminal law.” See Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-\nl6; see also Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (‘criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose” (internal quotation omited)).*\n\nB. The offenses charged in Counts One through Four do not necessarily entail\n\nthe sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child.\n\nUnder the “necessarily entails” approach, § 3283 does not apply: None of the charged\ncounts “necessarily” entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” See l8\n® Nor has the Second Circuit held otherwise. In Weingarten, because the issue arose in the context of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, the court concluded only that it was “not obvious” that § 3283 required an elements-\nbased approach. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 53, 58-59.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l58 Filed o2/o5/2l Page 2 of 2\nPage 2\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient.

Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\n<span class=\"highlight\">Suspension</span> of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4). But Bridges is inapposite,\nsince it concerned a statute “[t]he legislative history of [which] emphasize[d] the propriety of its\nconservative interpretation” and “indicate[d] a purpose to suspend the general statute of limitations\nonly as to” certain narrouly defined offenses. Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l6. There is no corresponding\nindication that Congress intended the “essential ingredients” test to apply to Section 3283. As the\nThird Circuit has explained in rejecting an identical argument:\n\nWhile Bridges did adopt an “essential ingredient” test, the\nlimitations-extending statute at issue was a narrouly drafted\nexception specifically intended to target frauds related to war\nprocurement. Unlike the WSLA, § 3283 has no such restrictive\nlanguage or legislative history suggesting congressional intent to\nlimit its application to a specific subset of circumstances.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> to a medical <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span>\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of respondent's cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further application, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and respondent's cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and respondent is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> order and\nan earlier <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9.

We knou that based on the documentary evidence\n8 and the evidence that was adduced at the hearing as well as the\n9 evidence that was put forth in the affidavit of Susan Brune,\nlo that the Brune & Richard law firm had the <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> opinion\nigus prior to voir dire, and chose not bring it to this Court's\nl2 atention. As we all knou engaged in subsequent investigation\nl3 regarding Juror No, l, when Theresa Trzskoma started to have\nl4 certain doubts about her after the receipt of Juror No. l's\nLS note.\nl6 It's quite clear that this is not a case where the\npe defense counsel had been given a piece of information and did\nl8 nothing. That's quite, quite not what happened here. In fact,\nl9 we knou that prior to voir dire, they discussed the <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span>\n2o opinion, they chose not to bring it to the Court's atention.\n2l Instead relying simply on the voir dire answers; even though as\n22 this Court pointed out, far more trivial issues were aired by\n23 all of the parties, by the government and indeed by the Court,\n24 in terms of trying to figure out who would be good jurors.\n25 They chose not to bring that to the Court's atention then\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009917.jpg": "Cas6 2k OCs PAB name r= ate FRO LSA Pa Peeper sib.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> to a medical <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span>\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of respondent's cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further application, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and respondent's cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and respondent is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> order and\nan earlier <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9. Any notion that silence was intended to preserve undetected a basis for a new trial motion\nin the event of conviction is belied by the lawyers’ actions.

Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020275.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot epQO33ouAUNt Dieu tren2i5® lFiked §2lo5/2ig Pagel 2 af 2\nPage 2\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient.

Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span> of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. MDC staff\nalso conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.\nAt night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen\nminutes. To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the\ncell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes. The MDC\ncontinues to assess that these searches are all necessary for the safety of the institution and the\ndefendant.\n\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\nthe Government will promptly provide additional information.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021108.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page6l of ll3\n\nSimilarly, in Bridges v. U.S., 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), the Court applied a\ncategorical approach to the Wartime <span class=\"highlight\">Suspension</span> of Limitations Act (WSLA),\nwhich provided, in pertinent part, that “[w]hen the United States is at war the\nrunning of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense ... involving fraud or\natempted fraud against the United States ... shall be suspended....” Act of June\n25, l948, c. 546, 62 Stat. 828 (emphasis added) (codified in its present version at\nl8 U.S.C. § 3287). The Government charged Bridges with willfully making a false\nstatement, to wit, denying membership in the Communist Party, in connection with\nhis l945 naturalization application. Invoking the WSLA, the Government argued\nthat the charges were timely. But the Supreme Court, recalling Noveck and\nScharton, held that the WSLA was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding\nor atempting to defraud the United States is an essential ingredient of the offense\ncharged.” Id. at 22l (emphasis added).\n\nIn this case, the court made no atempt to distinguish Scharton or Noveck.\nAnd though it purported to distinguish Bridges, it blatantly mischaracterized the\nSupreme Court’s opinion, asserting that Bridges applied a categorical approach “in\nlarge part” because of the WSLA’s legislative history. Al49. The District Court’s\nstatement was wrong. Bridges’ passing reference to legislative history concerned a\ndifferent issue: whether the kind of “fraud” contemplated by the WSLA had to be\nfraud “of a pecuniary nature.” 346 U.S. at 2l6.

Michael Thomas would like this court to authorize the disclosure of any and all |\nreports generated by investigators within the Bureau of Prisons regarding the August lo, 2ol9\nincident, if those have not been disclosed. Additionally, the defendant seeks any all documents,\nreports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have\nengaged in the same or similar conduct. Mr. Thomas requests the results of any disciplinary\nproceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding the discipline or administrative ~\nadjudication of any other employees who have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts. More\nspecifically, the defense is aware that there was an almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6\nwherein officers failed to conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited\n\n. suicide. The defense believes that only one of four officers in that case was given only a minor\n(l4) day <span class=\"highlight\">suspension</span>. Moreover, although the government will argue that this incident is far\nremoved from the current incident, the defendant disagrees. Mr. Thomas knew some of the\nindividuals in that incident and he was well aware that their conduct did not lead to their\nindictment or incarceration. In fact, many of those officers did not receive as much as a\nreprimand for falsifying the same documents that Mr. Thomas is nou charged with a federal\ncrime for submiting. This goes to Mr. Thomas’ defense in this case. The defendant’s state of\nmind is always a material and relevant fact in any criminal case. Indeed, the mens rea for U.S.\nCode § lool is that the party knouingly and willfully made the false statement.
