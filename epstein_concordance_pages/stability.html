See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic <span class=\"highlight\">stability</span> sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag\nbetween the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009269.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEum Bute ne O65 Fileddz/24/22agePagee 27 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

She reviewed Epstein’s\nmedical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.\nEpstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any\nhistory of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and <span class=\"highlight\">stability</span>. Follouing\nthis July lo assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with\ndocumented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.\nThe follouing day, July ll, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist atempted to see Epstein in the morning and\nafternoon, but he was meeting with his atorneys. Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with\nEpstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the atorney conference area for a psychological\nobservation follou-up. During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this\nclinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was\nreceptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the\nPsychology Department.

Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of\nthe inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”\nThe Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with\na history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or\nidentification, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our\ninstitution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.\nR&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified\nimmediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an\ninmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and\nWarden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the\ngeneral population.\nInmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a\nmember of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general\npopulation. R&D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates\nentering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY\nALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be\nnotified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to\nscreen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other\npertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.\nInmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.\nPsychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,\nbut will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex\noffense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\nscheduled to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological <span class=\"highlight\">stability</span>, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there\nis no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk\nassessment by a psychologist.
