O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\n<span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 43\n29o — S. Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo59ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\n<span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span>\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> deconstruction. <span class=\"highlight\">Cognitive</span> deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. <span class=\"highlight\">Cognitive</span> deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

The conditions of her\nconfinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue\nto worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the\nregiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, exposure to cold temperature, daily\nhumiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial\nwould likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare\nher defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she\nwould atempt to flee given her personality profile and determination to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt. Like the assertion that she is a flight risk, alleging she is a suicide\nrisk is a total fiction. Recently, a senior staff person at the MDC stated, in substance: “The\nproblem we have with Ms. Maxwell is simple: she’s not a criminal.”\n\n*Honn, K. A., Hinson, J. M., Whitney, P., & Van Dongen, H.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972).

Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span>\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lol\n\nThe determination that a report of sexual assault is false can be\n\nmade only if the evidence establishes that no crime was commited or\n\natempted. This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false rape allegation. On March l3, 2oo6, the\nlacrosse team at Duke University hired two exotic dancers, Crystal Magnum\nand Kim Roberts, to perform at a house party (Hemmens, 2oo8). While\nat the house, Magnum fell unconscious for a short while after which an\nexchange of insults occurred between the lacrosse team and the two strip-\npers. Roberts then drove Magnum to a store where she was dropped off.\nAfter being arrested for public drunkenness, Magnum accused three of the\nDuke lacrosse teammates of rape.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\n<span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006826.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 43\n29o — S. Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6826", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\n<span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span>\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> deconstruction. <span class=\"highlight\">Cognitive</span> deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. <span class=\"highlight\">Cognitive</span> deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 7 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. <span class=\"highlight\">Cognitive</span>\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span>\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span>\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008076.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 7ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. <span class=\"highlight\">Cognitive</span>\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span>\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span>\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Recently she has manifested symptoms of depression and trauma such as\nanxiety, and minor <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> deficits. These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing\nsleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive\nexperience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which\nMs. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no\nway related to the charges that have been brought against her.

The fact that she was subjected to\nan anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that\nshe was being treated differently, without any objective justification. Follouing the verdict, and\nin the presence of two officers, an MDC psychologist told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed on\nsuicide watch. The psychologist stated she had opposed placing Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch\nbecause Ms. Maxwell did not then and never had presented any suicidal indications. Houever,\nthe psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.\nIsolated from all inmates and denied social visits due to COVID restrictions, her only\nhuman contact was with the staff that controlled her, except when COVID restrictions for counsel\nvisits were lifted.

Despite her symptoms, Ms. Maxwell has maintained her innocence and continues\nto express a determination to fight her case.\n\nCollateral Interview\n\nI conducted a collateral telephone interview with Ms. Leah Saftian, Ms. Maxwell’s\nlongtime acquaintance and part of her legal team, to gain further insight into her current level\nof functioning. Ms. Saffian reported that she has worked with Ms. Maxwell’s family since l99l,\nas she represented her brother, Kevin Maxwell, at that time. She was reportedly hired to legally\nrepresent Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 and has spoken to her on the phone every day since that time.\n\nSince Ms. Maxwell’s incarceration, Ms. Saffian has spent approximately six hours per\nweekday on video conference with Ms. Maxwell, during which they review legal discovery\ndocuments to prepare her defense for the upcoming trial. She described Ms. Maxwell as\n“highly intelligent, well-educated, exceptional in so many ways,” houever, she stated, “I have\nseen her deteriorate” since her incarceration, which Ms. Saffian described as “frightening.”\nShe described the conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is being detained as “psychological\ntorture,” in that she ls being held in “quasi-solitary confinement,” where the officers assigned\nto her are often hostle.\n\nMs. Saffian characterized Ms. Maxwell as “vibrant” and “wity” prior to her recent\nincarceration. Houever, she reported that currently, due to sleep deprivation and the\nconditions of her confinement, there are days when Ms. Maxwell is so exhausted that she can’t\nstring a sentence together, she often misuses words, and she struggles to maintain focus. Ms.\nSaffian reported that Ms. Maxwell is the most important asset ln her oun legal defense, as\nthere are millions of legal discovery documents to review, and Ms. Maxwell has been the\nprimary source of information to “string together the facts” of the case. Ms. Saftian added\nthat Ms. Maxwell is often the one to notice factual errors within the legal discovery that her\nlegal team often does not pick up on, houever, due to “marked deterioration” since her\nincarceration, it has been increasingly difficult for Ms. Maxwell to sustain her atention to do\nso. Ms. Saffian added that recently, Ms. Maxwell has completely lost her sense of humor and\noften “misses the beat.”\n\nMs. Saffian reported that she does not consider Ms. Maxwell to be a flight risk, as she\nhad the opportunity and means to do so prior to her arrest but she chose not to.

If she were permited to be released into\nthe community, her symptoms would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the\nopportunity to properly prepare her defense for trial.\n\nAt this tme, Ms. Maxwell currently poses litle to no risk to the community, as she has\nno prior history of criminal or violent behavior and her current charges could only have been\nmanifest under a very specific set of circumstances which she cannot find herself in if she were\nto be released.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n8 training, what factors, if any, place a child at increased risk\n9 of being sexually abused?\n\nlo A. The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they\nl2 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the child's\n\nl3 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to\nl4 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues\n\nl5 pertaining to the family.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have experienced victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child\n23 sexual abuse. We knou that children who come from\n24 disadvantaged circumstances can be at higher risk, children\n25 with <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> and intellectual disabilities, for example;\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool234o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page lo9 of l58lo9\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\nl BY MR.

That testimony is struck.\n\n5 Go ahead.\n\n6 BY MS. POMERANTZ:\n\n7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n8 training, what factors, if any, place a child at increased risk\n9 of being sexually abused?\n\nlo A. The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they\nl2 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the child's\n\nl3 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to\nl4 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues\n\nl5 pertaining to the family.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have experienced victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child\n23 sexual abuse. We knou that children who come from\n24 disadvantaged circumstances can be at higher risk, children\n25 with <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> and intellectual disabilities, for example;\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7928", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023415.jpg": "harming others. Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts.

Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of <span class=\"highlight\">cognitive</span> behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein. According to\nher report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The\nreport further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,\nintention, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to\nmake phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly\nphone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and\ndid not appear to be in any distress. The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any\nunusual behaviors related to Epstein. She provided Epstein with supportive interventions and\n\n48\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l5"};
