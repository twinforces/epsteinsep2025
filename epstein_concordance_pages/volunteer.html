From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or <span class=\"highlight\">volunteer</span> with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005892.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or <span class=\"highlight\">volunteer</span>, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “...

While at FIT, I took advantage of different <span class=\"highlight\">volunteer</span> opportunities and internships in\nthe fashion industry to provide a foundation for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a\nChristmastime internship at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as\na part-time employee. I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.\n\nIn the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where\nshe was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was\nelectrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,\nof difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of hou we both saw New York as a\nchance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)\nwas Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which ouned Henri Bendel\nat the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have\nto carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later\nthat day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel\nclose by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted\nme to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they\nsexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I returned to my classes at FIT and\ncontinued work at Henri Bendel, but I started to crack.

Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them.

He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023736.jpg": "— —\nIII, POLICY\nBureau of Prisons policy states a pretrial inmate may not be compelled to work other than to perform\nhousekeeping tasks in the inmate’s oun cell and in the community living area.\nFOR STAFF USE\nONLY\nI am referring this inmate to the institution’s psychologist/psychiatrist because:\nThe inmate’s behavior suggests the inmate may not be able to comprehend this waiver.\n___The inmate has been admited for mental evaluation or treatment.\na\nStaff Signature/Printed Name /Title Date\nIV.

Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close\nrelationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of\nthese friends atest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always\naccorded them.\nKathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follous:\nIt’s difficult to express hou much Jeffrey's friendship has meant to me\nover the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian\nangel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood\nhou much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the\ncosts of our son's education. This past June, our son graduated from\n° Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible\nwithout Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.\n\nTerry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has knoun Jeffrey since\nl958, wrote:\n\nFrom the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was\nalways in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently\ncall upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he\nwas doing to listen and help. .. .\n\nIam aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to charitable causes and programs.\nthat he believes will make a difference to mankind and society — many of\nwhich are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can atest that he\nis also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when\nhe spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my l9 year old son Philip\nto help him sort out academic problems he was having.\n\nWarren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from\nJeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,\nincluding the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer\n\n4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033225.jpg": "breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\njokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Weill, Jeff managed to <span class=\"highlight\">volunteer</span> us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\ngraduated.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many childhood friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a difference [as] our worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225"};
