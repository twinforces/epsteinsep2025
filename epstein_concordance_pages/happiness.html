Ghislaine is not a malicious or jealous person. In all the\nI have knoun her, I have never seen her be violent or act inappropriately against anyone, let\nalone young adults or children as has been alleged.\n| ee believe in her innocence. I knou\nshe would never do anything to put my life or my family’s life in jeopardy in any way, which\nis why I have no hesitation in placing the one property that I oun — which is my only nest-\negg for my retirement—up as part of her bail application. The value is $l.5 Million dollars. I\ndo not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating financially and in every\nway to my oun family were the house to be taken over by the Government due to a breach of\na bail conditions. I knou in every fibre of my being that Ghislaine will\nnever try to flee and will absolutely turn up to her trial, to have the opportunity to fight the\ncharges against her. Based on my deep knouledge and experience with Ghislaine SS\n| I totally trust and believe that I do not have to worry in any way about my home being\nput up as a part of her bail application.\nUntil her arrest, I spoke often with Ghislaine over the phone and in the early summer of this\near, two to four times a week.\n\nI witnessed hou hard she worked every day and well into the nights going through the\never-grouing tsunami of press clippings, videos, audio files, etc, that so gravely traduced her\nand continue to do so. Ghislaine is completely horrified and flabbergasted by these\nunfounded and completely horrendous accusations, as indeed am I.\n\nI feel totally safe around Ghislaine, in fact, I feel safer with her. I have never had any\nhesitation in my children visiting her or being with her — as they have been — both as young\nchildren and nou they are older. Neither they nor I have ever seen any signs or signals of the\nalleged criminal conduct. I personally witnessed her be a warm, lovely, understanding and\ncaring When visiting Ghislaine more recently as well as in\nthe past I was\nimpressed by her interaction with them and by their evident trust in and great affection for her\nwhich was entirely natural and unforced. Every exchange was totally normal and just lovely\nto watch hou each of these P| clearly liked P| and she them. Although\nGhislaine was certainly part of the New York social scene in the past, for many years, it had\nbecome clear to me that she was happy in a long-term loving relationship with her previous\npartner of over 7 years far away from the New York scene and with i\nleading a happy family life with people she loved and trusted and who were similarly equally\nloving and trusting of her. I saw the same patern of strong domesticity and family <span class=\"highlight\">happiness</span>\nwith her spouse a I have personally witnessed hou much they love\nbeing with and being loved by Ghislaine.\nIn terms of character, Ghislaine is compassionate, capable, and proactive. Ghislaine is very\nkind and caring, She brovch i l. siay with\nher in New York for extended periods so that they could spend quality time together. She\ntook them all around the US to see the sights and to visit with family and friends. Even under\nthe terrible weight of her present circumstances, she has consistently demonstrated her\nconsideration for others. Whenever we spoke, she asked bout\nThe fact that she could care enough and not just be thinking only of herself at this impossible\ntime remains deeply moving to me.\n\n3|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel7 of 77\nExhibit F.\nCatherine Vaughan-Edwards, a friend, former employee, and the mother of Ghislaine’s\ngodson, relates her experience as a mentee:\nThe person that I have knoun for 34 years, is not the same as the Ghislaine so\nnegatively portrayed by the press and mainstream media.
