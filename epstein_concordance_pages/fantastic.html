Consistent with the\nforegoing, the SDNY Jury Plan creates two separate Master Wheels—one for the White Plains\ncourthouse and one for the Manhatan courthouse, each of which draws from certain counties, with\nsome overlapping counties. SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a <span class=\"highlight\">fantastic</span> pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o. Under the\nrelevant jury plan, jurors for trials held in Brooklyn were drawn from the entire Eastern District,\nwhile jurors for trials held in the “Long Island Division,” which included the Uniondale\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004757.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page l4 of 32 lo\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl Mr. Coates, but she read some books by Mr. Coates.
