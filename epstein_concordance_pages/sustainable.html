USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.'** The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nlS As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl4 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a <span class=\"highlight\">sustainable</span> conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021338.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON G4 3536o38, Pagel66 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a <span class=\"highlight\">sustainable</span> conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.
