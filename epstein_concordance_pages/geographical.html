The Court disagrees for two\nindependent reasons.

The provision of the NPA dealing with\nco-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds\nU.S. Atorneys in other districts. It does not expressly\nstate that it applies in other districts. The relevant\nlanguage, in its entirety, reads as follous: “the United\nStates also agrees that it will not institute any crimi-\nnal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” Dkt.

The Government is required to observe high\nstandards of integrity and honorable conduct, and the supervisory pouer of the court is designed\nto insure that such standards are observed.”). Thus, plea agreements are construed “strictly\nagainst the government.” United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v. Vaval, 4o4 F.3d l44, l52 (2d Cir. 2oo5)). “Because such agreements involve\nwaivers of fundamental constitutional rights, “prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\nperformance.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (quoting Vaval, 4o4 F.3d at l53). Finally, “[t]he\nprosecutor's office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise\nmade by one atorney must be atributed . . . to the Government.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l9o\n(quoting Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o, l54 (l972)).\n\nThe government’s atempt to evade the NPA flies in the face of these time-honored, and\nhonorable, principles. Rather than stand behind the promises it made in the NPA, the\ngovernment tries to escape them by arguing that Ms. Maxwell has no standing to enforce them—\na position that is contradicted by the unambiguous text of the NPA as well as by clear precedent.\nThe government also tries to pretend that the NPA contains <span class=\"highlight\">geographical</span> and temporal\nlimitations that simply do not exist. In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the interpretation and enforcement of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou manufacture ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established principle that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution.

Dkt. No. l42 at l-2. Epstein agreed\nin the NPA to plead guilty in Florida state court to\nsoliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen\nmonths in a county jail. Jd. In exchange, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office agreed not to charge him with federal\ncrimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming\nfrom its investigation of his conduct between 2ool and\n2oo7. Id. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges\nagainst any of his “potential co-conspirators.” Id.\n\nAs a recent report from the Department of Justice’s\nOffice of Professional Responsibility observed, the\nNPA was unusual in many respects, including its\nbreadth, leniency, and secrecy. OPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3,\nDkt. No. 2o4-3, at x, 8o, l75, l79, 26o-6l. The U.S.\nAtorney’s promise not to prosecute unidentified co-\nconspirators marks a stark departure from normal\npractice for federal plea agreements. This provision\nappears to have been added “with litle discussion or\nconsideration by the prosecutors.” Id. at l69, l85. The\nreport concluded that the U.S. Atorney’s negotiation\nand approval of the NPA did not amount to\nprofessional misconduct, but nonetheless reflected\n“poor judgment.” Id. at l69.\n\nOnly the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is\npresently before the Court. Maxwell contends that the\nNPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as\na co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s\nco-conspirator provision lacks any <span class=\"highlight\">geographical</span> or\ntemporal limitations. The Court disagrees for two\nindependent reasons. First, under controlling Second\nCircuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S.\nAtorney for the Southern District of New York.\nSecond, it does not cover the offenses charged in the Sl\nsuperseding indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooll8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000120.tif": "57a\nevery instance to make clear that it applies only in the\ndistrict where signed.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite\nconclusion. The provision of the NPA dealing with\nco-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds\nU.S. Atorneys in other districts. It does not expressly\nstate that it applies in other districts. The relevant\nlanguage, in its entirety, reads as follous: “the United\nStates also agrees that it will not institute any crimi-\nnal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” Dkt. No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi, Salameh,\nand Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States”\nagrees not to prosecute implies no restriction on\nprosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to\nprosecution in the Southern District of Florida. The\nfirst states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida will defer “prosecution in this\nDistrict” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt.\nNo. l42-l at 2. The second states that no prosecution\n“will be instituted in this District, and the charges\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed” after he\nfulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator\nprovision must mean that it lacks any <span class=\"highlight\">geographical</span>\nlimitation. If anything, that language reflects that the\nNPA’s scope was expressly limited to the Southern\nDistrict of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone\n“affirmatively apparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,—\nthat the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on\nthe prosecution of co-conspirators without clearly so\nsaying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text,\nMaxwell turns to its negotiation history.
