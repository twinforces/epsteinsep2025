Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl.

Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured\nprofound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the\nyears follouing. To nou compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—\nespecially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the leter and the spirit of\nthe CVRA.\nThe CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point touard narrou tailoring, maximal\nprivacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight.\nWe respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.\nRespectfully submited,\nBradley Edwards\nBritany Henderson\nEDWARDS HENDERSON\n425 North Andrews Avenue, Suite 2\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 333ol\nTelephone: (954) 524-282o\nEmail: brad@cvlf.com\n\nbritany@cvlf.com\nPaul G.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5877", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 975\n\nBerliner, L., & Conte, J.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 975\n\nBerliner, L., & Conte, J.

The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S.

In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v.

According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v.

Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to Six |\nseparate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single |\nlocked door to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU |\nhave keys while on duty.

On weekdays, the MCC conducts five <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> counts\nat 4 p.m., lo p.m., l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. Performing an\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count is one of the most basic and essential aspects\nof a correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most\nbasic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. Two\nofficers are required to perform the <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count for each\nhousing unit, including the SHU, and are further required to\ndocument their performance of the count on an official MCC form\ncalled a count slip.

He has not carried his burden through a shouing of any\nevidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.\n\nAs to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any\nevidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of\nconduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].” Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal\nquotation marks omited). “A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who\nhas commited roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom\nthe law has not been enforced.” United States v.

In any event, even were the conduct similar,\nthat Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally\nprosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, Thomas points to the fact that “Officer-l” and “Officer-2” in the Indictment,\nwho falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> counts on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, respectively, were not prosecuted.

Thomas\nalso questions why his supervisors or other MCC personnel who received and reviewed Thomas’s\nfalse count slips were not also prosecuted with making false statements, but those supervisors or\npersonnel are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false\nstatements—Thomas did. In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the “suspicion [and]\nsurmise” contained in Thomas’s motion simply do not constitute “objective evidence” warranting\ndiscovery. See United States v.

Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of l5 inmates who had been\nhoused at MCC New York during time periods relevant to our investigation, including three who were\nhoused in the L Tier of the SHU on the day Epstein died.’ Those three L-Tier inmates were housed in cells\nopposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9-lo.\nThe OIG also reached out to one of Epstein’s atorneys to discuss the possibility of providing information,\nbut ultimately the atorney declined to be interviewed, citing atorney-client privilege (the atorney-client\nprivilege survives a client's death) and issues related to ongoing litigation involving Epstein’s estate.\nThe OIG also collected over l27,ooo documents, as well as MCC New York video and photographs.

Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the <span class=\"highlight\">Institutional</span> Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an <span class=\"highlight\">Institutional</span> Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the <span class=\"highlight\">Institutional</span> Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified. As a\n5 This BOP form is officially entitled “Metropolitan Correctional Center; New York, New York; Official Count Slip.”\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23428", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023429.jpg": "result, many SHU staff and supervisors were unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate as the Psychology\nDepartment had determined was necessary, and Epstein was alone and unobserved in his cell for an\nextended period of time.\nl. The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nThe OIG's investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2ol9, was inaccurate\nbecause SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a\npredetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time. Houever, Epstein, who was in the\nSHU atorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.\nThe OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at\nlo p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not\ncorrected until l2 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span>\ncount and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at\nthat time.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he\ntold the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be. In addition, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of\ninmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time.\nWhen interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from\nAugust 9, 2ol9, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel. Based on his\nreview, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and\nNoel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote doun the numbers they\nthought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate\n(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another\nhousing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon\nthe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 atempt to retrieve an unknoun item from his\nvisitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room. The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2ol9, reflected that\nfollouing this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:l5 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving\nand Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for observation when they are\nbelieved to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the inaccurate 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and\nwent by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred\nfrom the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the\n4 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the\nSHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.\nIn his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknouledged that neither he nor\nany other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had\nprepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day. The\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel’s name and signature also appeared on the 4 p.m.\n62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23429", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023430.jpg": "count slip.7° During his OIG interview, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed BOP documents\nregarding the inmate's transfer from the SHU and acknouledged further that based on that transfer, the\nnumber of inmates listed on the SHU count slip he and Noel submited for the 4 p.m. count, the count slip\nwas incorrect.\nNoel admited in the deferred prosecution agreement she entered into with the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York that she completed false count slips on August 9 and lo. Noel initially told\nthe OIG that she did not conduct the 4 p.m. count on August 9, but after acknouledging that she signed the\n4 p.m. SHU count slip, Noel said she did not recall if she conducted the count. According to Noel, she and\nother SHU staff filled out the count slip before conducting the counts because they knew the number of\ninmates they were supposed to report.\n2. The lo p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nAt the time of the lo p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in\ntheir cells for the night. At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for\nconducting the lo p.m. stand up count. At lo p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were Noel\nand the Material Handler. Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness\nstatements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff did not perform the lo p.m.\ncount in the SHU.?”? Nonetheless, Noel and the Material Handler completed and signed the lo p.m. SHU\ncount slip. The lo p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as “73 + l.” According to the MCC\nNew York master count sheet for the lo p.m. count on August 9, 2ol9, all units had verbally reported their\ninmate counts to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m. At approximately lo:36 p.m., the Control Center\ncompleted all paperwork and officially cleared the lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count.\nThe Material Handler said he was present at the time of the lo p.m. count, but that the count was not\nconducted because everyone was tired. The Material Handler noted that on August 9, he had worked an\novertime shift from l2 a.m. until 8 a.m., his regular shift from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., folloued by his SHU overtime\nshift from 4 p.m. to midnight. Thus, at the time of the lo p.m. count, he had worked 22 consecutive hours at\nMCC New York. The Material Handler verified that he and Noel signed the lo p.m. count slip and believed\nthat Noel called the Control Center with their count numbers. He did not knou why the count slip listed\n\"73 + qe\nNoel told the OIG that she had conducted the SHU count alone at lo p.m. and that the Material Handler\nsigned the count slip even though he did not conduct the count with her. Houever, the OIG’s review and\nanalysis of the SHU security camera video conflicts with Noel’s statement that she conducted the lo p.m.\ncount. Specifically, the video reflects that it was not until between lo:29 p.m. and lo:36 p.m. when Noel\nwalked to different tiers inside the SHU. Yet, as described above, MCC New York records reflect that counts\nfrom all MCC New York housing units were reported to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m., as the count\n36 Prosecution was declined for BOP employees (other than Noel and Thomas) who falsely certified inmate counts and\nrounds on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\n37 The quality of the SHU video footage was poor. Therefore, in conjunction with reviewing the video, the OIG analyzed\nwitness statements and BOP records to beter determine what the video depicted.\n8 The official name for the document used to record an <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2343o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023431.jpg": "documentation shous the count was verbally cleared by the Control Center at lo:3o p.m. It therefore\nappears that the video depicts Noel conducting a later round in the SHU, as she was required to do every\n3o minutes during her shift, and not the lo p.m. SHU count.\nNoel said she wrote the 73 on the count slip but she did not remember if she or someone else had writen\n“+ l\" on the count slip and she did not knou why “+l” was on the count slip. Noel claimed that, unlike the\n4 p.m. count slip, which the Evening Watch Officer in Charge pre-filled, she did not prepare the lo p.m.\ncount slip in advance of the count. Noel said she did not knou that the lo p.m. SHU count slip, which listed\n73 inmates, was inaccurate, and she could not explain why the l2 a.m. count also inaccurately listed that\n73 inmates were physically present in the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. count slips accurately listed\n72 inmates in the SHU.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he worked in the Control Center from\napproximately 4 p.m. until l2 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from l2 a.m. until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo. According to Senior Officer Specialist 6, he took the August 9 lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count by\nhimself in the Control Center, and assisted with the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts on August lo as an\nInternal Officer.

When questioned by the OIG about the lo p.m. SHU count slip that listed “73 + l” inmates and\nwas signed by the Material Handler and Noel, Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that he believed that\nthe “+ l\" on the count slip was in his handwriting. Senior Officer Specialist 6 also reviewed the lo p.m.\nReceiving and Discharge count slip, which listed “9S + l” on the count slip and told the OIG that it was his\nhandwriting.*? Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the “9S + l\" on the SHU count slip meant that he\nwas “ghost counting” the inmate (Inmate 4) who had been moved from the SHU, located in the 9 South area,\nto the Receiving and Discharge area earlier that day. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said that because there\nwere, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the lo p.m. count, he should have writen “73 - l\" on\nthe SHU count slip rather than “73 + l”.\n39 According to BOP records and witness interviews, “9S” refers to the SHU, which was located in 9th Floor South section\nof MCC New York.\n\n64\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2343l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023432.jpg": "Figure 5.l\nlo p.m. Count Slips from the SHU and Receiving and Delivery on August 9\n.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that\nafter learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in\nSENTRY. This update is reflected in Inmate 4’s Inmate History Quarters, which states that Inmate 4 was\ntransferred out of the SHU into a different housing unit on August lo, 2ol9, at l2:35 a.m. The Morning\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23432", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023433.jpg": "Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she believed she told the SHU staff to conduct a new count\nand create a new count slip, but she did not knou if they had actually done so.\nDuring his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate\ntransfer, the l2 a.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count, and the housing unit count slips. Based on his review of this\nmaterial, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the l2 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued to\nlist 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 6 reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told\nthe OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.\nAt approximately l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material\nHandler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU.

Through review and analysis\nof the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and\nThomas did not perform any of these counts.

Noel and Thomas both admited to the OIG that they did not conduct the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and\n5 a.m. counts on August lo, and that they had falsified the respective count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she signed the August lo l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips that Thomas had\nprefilled. Noel said she did not knou why the l2 a.m. count slip documented that there were 73 inmates in\nthe SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. slips documented there were only 72 inmates. Noel recalled that\nThomas had spoken with someone and then they changed the count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she and CO 3 conducted the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts in MCC New York's lo South\nUnit, which is the single-celled secure unit adjacent to the SHU. Noel said that when she left the SHU to\nassist CO 3, she took the SHU keys with her and that no one could have accessed the SHU while she was\ngone because she had to physically open the door for anyone who came into the SHU.

As part of their assigned duties, MCC New York SHU officers had to walk each of the\ntiers of the SHU twice an hour on an irregular schedule, once during the first 3o minutes and again during\nthe second 3o minutes, with both rounds occurring no more than 4o minutes apart. COs working in the\nSHU were required to complete and initial an official MCC New York form, often referred to as a “round\nsheet,” which was reviewed and signed by a supervisor, documenting the date and time of each 3o-minute\nround in each tier of the SHU.*°\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff spoke about conducting rounds on Epstein\nevery day. He said that the Warden, Lieutenants, and other MCC New York staff members frequently told\nthe SHU staff to conduct rounds and to keep an eye on Epstein. To reinforce this message, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge created a sign on orange paper that he hung on a computer in the SHU officer's area\nthat said, “MANADATORY [sic] ROUNDS MUST BE CONDUCTED EVERY 3o MINUTES ON EPSTEIN # 763l8-o54\nAS PER GOD!!!” The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said the sign was hanging on the computer on\nAugust 9 and lo, 2ol9, and it was clearly visible to everyone who worked in the SHU.

The Correctional Systems Officer notified\nthe New York Police Department (NYPD) via the MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> NYPD telephone. The\nCorrectional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance and medical\nassistance for one of the inmates. The New York City Fire Department and EMS arrived at MCC New York at\n6:43 a.m. and were escorted to the second-floor medical area. EMS departed MCC New York with Epstein\nand a BOP escort via ambulance and chase car to the local hospital at 7:lo a.m.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was relieved as the Operations Lieutenant\nprior to 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, but was still working on things like the Daily Activity Reports and\nLieutenant Logs that she did not get to finish during her shift. At some point, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant heard that there was a medical emergency in SHU, so she went to assist because she\nknew that inmates would need to be given food and other things would need to be done. The Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant estimated that she went to the SHU around 7 a.m. to help with the inmate\nmeals, and believed the Electronics Technician was also helping out. Noel was there, but she was not\nhelping with delivering food to the inmates. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that after the\nmeals were delivered, she finished up and went home.\nAll MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any\ninformation suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Additionally, no\ninmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his oun life\nor had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\nSome MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other\nthings, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had\nbeen conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,\nwhich resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired\nduring their shifts. Other MCC New York staff members told the OIG that even if inmate safety and\naccountability measures had been property executed, an inmate who wanted to take his life would have\nfound a way to do so.\nB. Items Found in Epstein’s Cell on August lo Follouing His Death\nFollouing Epstein’s death, the BOP and FBI collected many of the items found inside Epstein’s cell. The FBI\ninspected the cell and retrieved what it believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player. The FBI did not recover\nany weapons inside of the cell. After the FBI's inspection, the BOP recycled the linens from Epstein’s cell and\ncollected the remaining items, which included various over-the-counter medications, books (including\nreligious books), BOP pamphlets, toiletries, bateries, headphones, glasses, mail and envelopes, a broun\npaper bag, an orange homemade rope, AED pads, and a medical device.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23443", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023450.jpg": "recorded video was available for several of the institution's cameras, so she reported the mater to the\nCommunications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his\nshift was scheduled to end. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\ninstitution's approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG\nfound that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> staff must perform periodic\nchecks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to\nrecord.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he nou checks to ensure that all\ncameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report\nabout the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.\n\nB. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure\nOn August 8, follouing discovery of the recording failure, Company l service request records reflect that the\nElectronics Technician contacted a Company l technical support representative, who ultimately determined\nthat two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems.

False Statements and Lack of Candor\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in\nCharge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas made false statements when they falsified BOP records by\natesting that they had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not.\nFederal law provides that “whoever, in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3).\nAs discussed above, the OIG found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler,\nNoel, and Thomas failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts.

Additionally, Noel admited\nto the OIG that she had prefilled the official MCC New York forms documenting the times of the 3o-minute\nrounds, often referred to as round sheets, and falsely atested to having completed the rounds.”®\nNoel and Thomas were indicted by a grand jury for their false certifications of having conducted counts and\nrounds. Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Atorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York\ndeclined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler.\nThe OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel,\nand Thomas knouingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by atesting that they\nhad completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nAdditionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation\nand truthfully respond to questions. The OIG found that Noel lacked candor when she told the OIG that she\nhad conducted the lo p.m. count when the weight of evidence indicates that, at most, she may have\nconducted a round at the time.\n3. Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York supervisory staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 4%) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023472.jpg": "minimum elapsed time of on ‘days off’ will be fifty-six (56) hours, except when the employee requests\nthe change.””?\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that on August 9 he reported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m.\nto 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift in the warehouse. At some point during the day\nshift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, a higher ranking official, called and asked the Material Handler\nif he could work overtime in the SHU and he agreed. The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt\npressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9\nthrough l2 a.m. on August lo. As discussed previously, the Material Handler admited to the OIG that on\nthe evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not conduct the\nmandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired.\nThe OIG investigation and review concluded that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant exercised poor\njudgment when he requested that the Material Handler work a third consecutive shift. As the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, he had access to the staff roster and schedule and therefore he should have knoun\nthat the Material Handler had already worked l6 straight hours. Additionally, the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant's action was inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and did not reflect sound\ncorrectional judgment, as it would have been extremely difficult for the Material Handler to have effectively\nperformed his duties during his third shift.\n4. Clearing the lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">Institutional</span> Count Knouing that It Was Inaccurate\nThe OIG's investigation and review determined that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff cleared the\nlo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count knouing that the inmate counts from two housing units were inaccurate.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that COs conducting an <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count relay the\ncount verbally to the Control Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates.®° If a count reported\nverbally does not match the master count, the Control Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and\nthe staff members must recount the inmates. MCC New York SHU Post Orders further provide that “[c]ount\nslips which appear to be altered will not be accepted.”\nAs discussed previously, the OIG determined that an internal transfer of an inmate (Inmate 4) from the SHU\nto Receiving and Discharge on August 9 was not documented appropriately at the time of the transfer. The\nfailure to document the transfer, along with the SHU staff not conducting the required inmate counts,\nresulted in the MCC New York Control Center receiving a count slip from the SHU with an incorrect number\nof inmates identified as being present within the SHU at the lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count.\nDuring his OIG interview, Senior Officer Specialist 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admited that\nhe amended the lo p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an atempt to\nreflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU follouing the internal inmate transfer that resulted in a\nSHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day.

Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed\nabove, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the\nperformance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®’ Additionally, BOP\npolicy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are\nbeing folloued.®\nThe OIG's investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°? The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct\nany rounds in the SHU. He acknouledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did\nnot sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at lo p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the l2 a.m. count on August lo, which was due to SHU\nstaff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the\ninmates in the SHU. According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have\nconducted another count and submited a new count slip, but she did not knou if they actually did so.\nDuring her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed\nthat the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during\nwhich time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station\nin the common area of the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was not\nrequired to visit each tier or go to each individual cell during a lieutenant round, but rather the purpose of\nthe Lieutenant round was for her to speak with the officers on duty.

The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Acting Evening\nWatch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not supervise any\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> counts, which was due to the start and end time of her overtime shift.

Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate. The supplemental\n88 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report\nl6-o5 June 2ol6).\n89 U.S. DOJ OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera System, Management\nAdvisory Memorandum 22-ool (October 2o2l).\n\nllo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23477", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023478.jpg": "policy does not, houever, describe hou long the cellmate requirement should last or if any staff must\napprove the removal of the cellmate requirement. The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch. Additionally, the\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023481.jpg": "8. The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> security camera\nsystems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to\nrecord video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\n\nAs discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels\nof leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system's recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s\ndeath, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis\nto ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2ol9, video from approximately half\nof the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for\nll days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera\nsystems must have the capacity to record or that <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> staff must perform periodic checks to ensure\nthe camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video\nstreams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can\npotentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that\nthe BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> security\ncamera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct\nperiodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action\nas soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable. Such routine checks would help ensure that\ncamera system malfunctions are detected and corrective actions are initiated in a timely manner.\n\nll4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2348l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023484.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 3 of 3\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate\nwhereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when\nconducting a round.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address\nstaffing shortages at its prisons.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.

Houever” hhoted in her e-mail she was\nnot convinced of this, adding, “He seems dazed and withdrawn.” She went on to say, “So\njust to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.” Despite the fact that Lieutenan[\"°\"\"_hpened\nthe e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by\nP5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.

This was a significant\ndisappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt\nto incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist\nshould have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The\nBOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider\nthe special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”\nFurthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to\nmove [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate\nare reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security\nconcerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.”\n\nSS Eee\n\nBoth of these groups of inmates are\nsusceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience\nstress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,\nmovement to and from court, <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> movement, and release of information through\nthe media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he\ndeparted or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in\nSENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)\nprovided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The\nnotice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The\nUSMS requested R&D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy.\nOn August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m.[P° °°” |sent 75 Jan e-mail reporting she had :\njust become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information\nabout this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services\nabout a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been folloued as outlined\nin P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.

The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\nscheduled to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there\nis no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk\nassessment by a psychologist.

While on suicide watch on July 23, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein atended an\natorney visit from approximately l2:4o p.m. until 7:l5 p.m. During this time, he was\nwithout “direct, continuous observation” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by\nP5324.o8. While on Psychological Observation, he atended atorney visits on\nJuly 24, 2ol9, for ll.25 hours; on July 25, 2ol9, for ll.25 hours; on July 26, 2ol9, for\n9.25 hours; on July 27, 2ol9, for ll.33 hours; on July 28, 2ol9, for lo.5 hours; and on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, for 8 hours. On July 3o, 2ol9, Psychology Observation was terminated.\nDuring these visits, continuous observation by a dedicated BOP staff member was not\nmaintained as required by MCC New York’s Procedural Memorandum for Psychological\nObservation.\n\n7. Follou-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2ol9. While\nconducting the lo:oo p.m. institution count that evenings acilities Assistant\nreported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-matrsnesento Drs. [P°.._jand\n\nBe. hnd Ciewenanf\" ate that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as\n“distraught, sad and a litle confused.” She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025228.jpg": "Page 984\nokay, and he reportedly said he was. Houever]? hoted in her e-mail she was\nnot convinced of this, adding, “He seems dazed and withdrawn.” She went on to say, “So\njust to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.” Despite the fact that Lieutenany!™ pened\nthe e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by\nP5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, ig bas concerned about\nsuicide risk, P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. requires her to maintain direct,\ncontinuous observation of Mr. Epstein. Whe pee\" lypened the e-mail the follouing\nMonday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated by pou Rt approximately\n9:3o a.m.\nMr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July l8, 2ol9. This was a significant\ndisappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt\nto incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist\nshould have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The\nBOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider\nthe special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”\nFurthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to\nmove [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate\nare reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and securit\nconcerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.”\nBoth of these groups of inmates are\nsusceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience\nstress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,\nmovement to and from court, <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> movement, and release of information through\nthe media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he\ndeparted or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in\nSENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)\nprovided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The\nnotice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The\nUSMS requested R&D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy.\nOn August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 am PORT Leng | an e-mail reporting she had\njust become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information\nabout this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services\nabout a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been folloued as outlined\nin P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when a staff member becomes\naware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25228", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025276.jpg": "Page lo53\nBP-S293.o52 INMATE RIGHTS AT DISCIPLINE HEARING cDFRM\nY_94\ni's?

Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea.

Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the <span class=\"highlight\">Institutional</span> Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an <span class=\"highlight\">Institutional</span> Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the <span class=\"highlight\">Institutional</span> Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023429.tif": "result, many SHU staff and supervisors were unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate as the Psychology\nDepartment had determined was necessary, and Epstein was alone and unobserved in his cell for an\nextended period of time.\nl. The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nThe OIG’s investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2ol9, was inaccurate\nbecause SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a\npredetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time. Houever, Epstein, who was in the\nSHU atorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.\nThe OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at\nlo p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not\ncorrected until l2 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span>\ncount and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at\nthat time.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he\ntold the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be. In addition, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of\ninmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time.\nWhen interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from\nAugust 9, 2ol9, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel. Based on his\nreview, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and\nNoel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote doun the numbers they\nthought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate\n(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another\nhousing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon\nthe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 atempt to retrieve an unknoun item from his\nvisitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room. The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2ol9, reflected that\nfollouing this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:l5 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving\nand Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for observation when they are\nbelieved to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the inaccurate 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and\nwent by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred\nfrom the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the\n4 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the\nSHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.\nIn his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknouledged that neither he nor\nany other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had\nprepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day. The\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel’s name and signature also appeared on the 4 p.m.\n62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23429", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023430.tif": "count slip.7° During his OIG interview, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed BOP documents\nregarding the inmate's transfer from the SHU and acknouledged further that based on that transfer, the\nnumber of inmates listed on the SHU count slip he and Noel submited for the 4 p.m. count, the count slip\nwas incorrect.\nNoel admited in the deferred prosecution agreement she entered into with the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York that she completed false count slips on August 9 and lo. Noel initially told\nthe OIG that she did not conduct the 4 p.m. count on August 9, but after acknouledging that she signed the\n4 p.m. SHU count slip, Noel said she did not recall if she conducted the count. According to Noel, she and\nother SHU staff filled out the count slip before conducting the counts because they knew the number of\ninmates they were supposed to report.\n2. The lo p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nAt the time of the lo p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in\ntheir cells for the night. At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for\nconducting the lo p.m. stand up count. At lo p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were Noel\nand the Material Handler. Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness\nstatements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff did not perform the lo p.m.\ncount in the SHU.?”? Nonetheless, Noel and the Material Handler completed and signed the lo p.m. SHU\ncount slip. The lo p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as “73 + l.” According to the MCC\nNew York master count sheet for the lo p.m. count on August 9, 2ol9, all units had verbally reported their\ninmate counts to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m.#8 At approximately lo:36 p.m., the Control Center\ncompleted all paperwork and officially cleared the lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count.\nThe Material Handler said he was present at the time of the lo p.m. count, but that the count was not\nconducted because everyone was tired. The Material Handler noted that on August 9, he had worked an\novertime shift from l2 a.m. until 8 a.m., his regular shift from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., folloued by his SHU overtime\nshift from 4 p.m. to midnight. Thus, at the time of the lo p.m. count, he had worked 22 consecutive hours at\nMCC New York. The Material Handler verified that he and Noel signed the lo p.m. count slip and believed\nthat Noel called the Control Center with their count numbers. He did not knou why the count slip listed\n\"73 + l\",\nNoel told the OIG that she had conducted the SHU count alone at lo p.m. and that the Material Handler\nsigned the count slip even though he did not conduct the count with her. Houever, the OIG’s review and\nanalysis of the SHU security camera video conflicts with Noel’s statement that she conducted the lo p.m.\ncount. Specifically, the video reflects that it was not until between lo:29 p.m. and lo:36 p.m. when Noel\nwalked to different tiers inside the SHU. Yet, as described above, MCC New York records reflect that counts\nfrom all MCC New York housing units were reported to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m., as the count\n36 Prosecution was declined for BOP employees (other than Noel and Thomas) who falsely certified inmate counts and\nrounds on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\n37 The quality of the SHU video footage was poor. Therefore, in conjunction with reviewing the video, the OIG analyzed\nwitness statements and BOP records to beter determine what the video depicted.\n8 The official name for the document used to record an <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2343o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023431.tif": "documentation shous the count was verbally cleared by the Control Center at lo:3o p.m. It therefore\nappears that the video depicts Noel conducting a later round in the SHU, as she was required to do every\n3o minutes during her shift, and not the lo p.m. SHU count.\nNoel said she wrote the 73 on the count slip but she did not remember if she or someone else had writen\n“+ l\" on the count slip and she did not knou why “+l” was on the count slip. Noel claimed that, unlike the\n4 p.m. count slip, which the Evening Watch Officer in Charge pre-filled, she did not prepare the lo p.m.\ncount slip in advance of the count. Noel said she did not knou that the lo p.m. SHU count slip, which listed\n73 inmates, was inaccurate, and she could not explain why the l2 a.m. count also inaccurately listed that\n73 inmates were physically present in the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. count slips accurately listed\n72 inmates in the SHU.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he worked in the Control Center from\napproximately 4 p.m. until l2 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from l2 a.m. until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo. According to Senior Officer Specialist 6, he took the August 9 lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count by\nhimself in the Control Center, and assisted with the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts on August lo as an\nInternal Officer. Senior Officer Specialist 6 confirmed to the OIG, as MCC New York records reflect, that he\nhad received verbal counts from all units by lo:3o p.m., and further stated that he had cleared the\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count at lo:36 p.m., which was when paperwork was complete and the count was\nofficially complete.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the MCC New York lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count, which shoued that the\nSHU had 73 inmates assigned, whereas the Receiving and Discharge Department had zero inmates assigned\nto the unit. When questioned by the OIG about the lo p.m. SHU count slip that listed “73 + l\" inmates and\nwas signed by the Material Handler and Noel, Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that he believed that\nthe “+ l\" on the count slip was in his handwriting. Senior Officer Specialist 6 also reviewed the lo p.m.\nReceiving and Discharge count slip, which listed “9S + l” on the count slip and told the OIG that it was his\nhandwriting.*? Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the “9S + l” on the SHU count slip meant that he\nwas “ghost counting” the inmate (Inmate 4) who had been moved from the SHU, located in the 9 South area,\nto the Receiving and Discharge area earlier that day. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said that because there\nwere, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the lo p.m. count, he should have writen “73 - l\" on\nthe SHU count slip rather than “73 + l”.\n39 According to BOP records and witness interviews, “9S” refers to the SHU, which was located in 9th Floor South section\nof MCC New York.\n\n64\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2343l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023432.tif": "Figure 5.l\nlo p.m. Count Slips from the SHU and Receiving and Delivery on August 9\n.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that if he had made the notations at the time of the\nlo p.m. count, he should not have cleared the count. Instead, he should have created a new master count\nsheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the\ninaccurate SHU count slip. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that an Operations Lieutenant would have\nneeded to authorize him to do the “ghost count” and write on the count slips, although he could not recall\nprecisely who gave him the authorization or when he had done so. The OIG investigation and review\ndetermined that the only Operations Lieutenant on duty at the time was the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant, who started her shift at lo p.m. on August 9. When questioned by the OIG, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant adamantly denied having authorized a “ghost count” and the OIG identified no\nrecord or witness (other than Senior Officer Specialist 6) to indicate that she had done so. The OIG\ninterviewed other MCC New York personnel, who said “ghost counting” was not permited, and stressed the\nimportance of an accurate physical count of inmates.\n3. The l2a.m.,3a.m., and 5 a.m. SHU Counts on August lo\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she supervised the August lo l2 a.m.\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count from the Control Center. During the count, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nsaid she identified the issue with the inaccuracy of the SHU count slip because it counted Inmate 4 as\npresent in the SHU, when in actuality he had been removed from the SHU and placed in the Receiving and\nDischarge dry cell the previous day (August 9, 2ol9). The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that\nafter learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in\nSENTRY. This update is reflected in Inmate 4’s Inmate History Quarters, which states that Inmate 4 was\ntransferred out of the SHU into a different housing unit on August lo, 2ol9, at l2:35 a.m. The Morning\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23432", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023433.tif": "Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she believed she told the SHU staff to conduct a new count\nand create a new count slip, but she did not knou if they had actually done so.\nDuring his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate\ntransfer, the l2 a.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count, and the housing unit count slips. Based on his review of this\nmaterial, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the l2 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued to\nlist 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 6 reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told\nthe OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.\nAt approximately l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material\nHandler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. Noel and Thomas were\nresponsible for conducting the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and analysis\nof the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and\nThomas did not perform any of these counts. Nonetheless, Noel and Thomas completed and signed SHU\ncount slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center cleared the\nl2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> counts at approximately l2:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., and 5:3o a.m.,\nrespectively. Noel and Thomas both admited to the OIG that they did not conduct the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and\n5 a.m. counts on August lo, and that they had falsified the respective count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she signed the August lo l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips that Thomas had\nprefilled. Noel said she did not knou why the l2 a.m. count slip documented that there were 73 inmates in\nthe SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. slips documented there were only 72 inmates. Noel recalled that\nThomas had spoken with someone and then they changed the count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she and CO 3 conducted the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts in MCC New York's lo South\nUnit, which is the single-celled secure unit adjacent to the SHU. Noel said that when she left the SHU to\nassist CO 3, she took the SHU keys with her and that no one could have accessed the SHU while she was\ngone because she had to physically open the door for anyone who came into the SHU. Noel also told the\nOIG that when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived to conduct a round at approximately\n4a.m., Noel let her into the SHU. The OIG’s review and analysis of the SHU video shous that the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant arrived in the SHU at approximately 4 a.m., visited the lo South Unit at\n4:o4 a.m., returned to SHU at 4:ll a.m., and left the SHU at 4:l4 a.m. According to Noel, no one other than\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3, as detailed later belou, entered the SHU during\nher shift.\nThomas told the OIG that since he had begun working with the BOP in 2oo7, he had worked in the SHU fairly\nregularly and he was familiar with hou to work in the SHU and hou the SHU operated. Thomas described\nhis responsibilities while working in the SHU as to maintain the count of inmates, make sure the inmates are\nfed, and, depending on the shift, make sure they get their shouers. Thomas’s Overtime Schedule shoued\nthat he worked 2l shifts in the SHU during morning watch from May through August 2ol9. The overtime\nschedule also shoued that Thomas worked l2 overtime shifts in the SHU when Epstein was assigned to the\nSHU in July and August 2ol9.\n\n66\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23433", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023470.tif": "on the evening of August 9 and the morning of August lo. Noel told the OIG that she conducted the lo p.m.\ncount on August 9. The OIG did not credit her statement based on: (l) its review of the SHU security\ncamera video, which reflects Noel walking up and doun the stairs leading to some, but not all, of the tiers\nseveral minutes after the SHU inmate count had been called into the Control Center; (2) the lo p.m. count\nslip, which erroneously included the SHU Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and\nDelivery; (3) other BOP records; and (4) the Material Handler’s statement to the OIG that no one conducted\nthe lo p.m. count because everyone was tired.\nInstead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found\nthat officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, including the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas\nprimarily remained seated in the SHU Officers’ Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time,\nsuggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of Internet searches on MCC New York\ncomputers. Thomas also admited to the OIG that he “dozed off” for periods of time during his shift. The\nOIG’s analysis of the SHU security camera video revealed that after approximately lo:4o p.m., no CO\nentered Epstein’s tier in the SHU until just before 6:3o a.m. when Noel and Thomas began to serve breakfast\nto the inmates.\nThe OIG investigation and review concluded that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material\nHandler, Noel, and Thomas failed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their\nrespective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, and that their actions constituted\nviolations of 5 C.F.R. 88 2635.lol(b)(5) and 2635.7o5(a), BOP Program Statements 342o.ll and 55oo.l4, and\nMCC New York SHU Post Orders.\n2. False Statements and Lack of Candor\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in\nCharge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas made false statements when they falsified BOP records by\natesting that they had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not.\nFederal law provides that “whoever, in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3).\nAs discussed above, the OIG found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler,\nNoel, and Thomas failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> inmate count, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two COs to conduct each\ncount and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York form, often called a\ncount slip.”> On the count slip, both COs are required to fill in the date and time the count had been\nperformed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then sign the\ncount slip. Once the COs complete and sign the count slips, the count slips are then collected and delivered\nto the MCC New York Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center are responsible for comparing\nthe count slips from each housing unit to the institution's overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each\n7 This BOP form is officially entitled “Metropolitan Correctional Center; New York, New York; Official Count Slip.”\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023471.tif": "inmate was accounted for.’”° Only after all the count slips have been collected from each housing unit, and\nthe numbers on the count slips had been matched to the institution’s overall inmate count sheet, could the\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count be deemed “cleared” or completed.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas each prepared and/or\nsigned a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability\nresponsibilities when, in fact, they had not.’”” These individuals admited to the OIG that instead of\nperforming their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed\nwere in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the\ndocuments knouing that they falsely atested to having completed the counts. Additionally, Noel admited\nto the OIG that she had prefilled the official MCC New York forms documenting the times of the 3o-minute\nrounds, often referred to as round sheets, and falsely atested to having completed the rounds.”®\nNoel and Thomas were indicted by a grand jury for their false certifications of having conducted counts and\nrounds. Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Atorney's Office of the Southern District of New York\ndeclined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler.\nThe OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel,\nand Thomas knouingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by atesting that they\nhad completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nAdditionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation\nand truthfully respond to questions. The OIG found that Noel lacked candor when she told the OIG that she\nhad conducted the lo p.m. count when the weight of evidence indicates that, at most, she may have\nconducted a round at the time.\n3. Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York supervisory staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 %) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023472.tif": "minimum elapsed time of on ‘days off’ will be fifty-six (56) hours, except when the employee requests\nthe change.””?\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that on August 9 he reported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m.\nto 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift in the warehouse. At some point during the day\nshift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, a higher ranking official, called and asked the Material Handler\nif he could work overtime in the SHU and he agreed. The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt\npressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9\nthrough l2 a.m. on August lo. As discussed previously, the Material Handler admited to the OIG that on\nthe evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not conduct the\nmandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired.\nThe OIG investigation and review concluded that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant exercised poor\njudgment when he requested that the Material Handler work a third consecutive shift. As the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, he had access to the staff roster and schedule and therefore he should have knoun\nthat the Material Handler had already worked l6 straight hours. Additionally, the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant's action was inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and did not reflect sound\ncorrectional judgment, as it would have been extremely difficult for the Material Handler to have effectively\nperformed his duties during his third shift.\n4. Clearing the lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">Institutional</span> Count Knouing that It Was Inaccurate\nThe OIG's investigation and review determined that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff cleared the\nlo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count knouing that the inmate counts from two housing units were inaccurate.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that COs conducting an <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count relay the\ncount verbally to the Control Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates.®° If a count reported\nverbally does not match the master count, the Control Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and\nthe staff members must recount the inmates. MCC New York SHU Post Orders further provide that “[c]ount\nslips which appear to be altered will not be accepted.”\nAs discussed previously, the OIG determined that an internal transfer of an inmate (Inmate 4) from the SHU\nto Receiving and Discharge on August 9 was not documented appropriately at the time of the transfer. The\nfailure to document the transfer, along with the SHU staff not conducting the required inmate counts,\nresulted in the MCC New York Control Center receiving a count slip from the SHU with an incorrect number\nof inmates identified as being present within the SHU at the lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count.\nDuring his OIG interview, Senior Officer Specialist 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admited that\nhe amended the lo p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an atempt to\nreflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU follouing the internal inmate transfer that resulted in a\nSHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day. Senior Officer Specialist 6\nacknouledged that he should have requested a recount from the SHU, but instead he cleared the lo p.m.\n7?

Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the action he took was knoun as “ghost counting,”\nsomething he said he would not have done without authorization from the Operations Lieutenant or\nsomeone of a higher rank than himself. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant denied having\nauthorized a “ghost count” and we found no evidence to corroborate Senior Officer Specialist 6’s claim that\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant knew of and approved the false count.\nThe OIG found that Senior Officer Specialist 6 modified the count slips received from the SHU and Receiving\nand Discharge, failed to request a recount of the SHU inmates, and cleared the lo p.m. <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> count\nknouing that it was inaccurate in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders.\n5. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed\nabove, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the\nperformance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®’ Additionally, BOP\npolicy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are\nbeing folloued.®\nThe OIG's investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°? The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct\nany rounds in the SHU. He acknouledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did\nnot sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at lo p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the l2 a.m. count on August lo, which was due to SHU\nstaff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the\ninmates in the SHU. According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have\nconducted another count and submited a new count slip, but she did not knou if they actually did so.\nDuring her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed\nthat the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during\nwhich time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station\nin the common area of the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was not\nrequired to visit each tier or go to each individual cell during a lieutenant round, but rather the purpose of\nthe Lieutenant round was for her to speak with the officers on duty.

The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Acting Evening\nWatch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not supervise any\n<span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> counts, which was due to the start and end time of her overtime shift. The Acting Evening Watch Activities\nLieutenant also told the OIG that she conducted one round in the SHU sometime between 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., during which\ntime she walked doun all of the tiers.\nlo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23473", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023478.tif": "policy does not, houever, describe hou long the cellmate requirement should last or if any staff must\napprove the removal of the cellmate requirement. The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch. Additionally, the\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023481.tif": "8. The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> security camera\nsystems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to\nrecord video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\n\nAs discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels\nof leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system’s recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s\ndeath, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis\nto ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2ol9, video from approximately half\nof the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for\nll days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera\nsystems must have the capacity to record or that <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> staff must perform periodic checks to ensure\nthe camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video\nstreams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can\npotentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that\nthe BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all <span class=\"highlight\">institutional</span> security\ncamera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct\nperiodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action\nas soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable.
