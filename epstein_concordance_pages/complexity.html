The nature of the allegations in\nthis case—decades-old allegations spanning multiple\nlocations—present considerable challenges for the\npreparation of the defense. Houever, the Government’s\nproposed disclosure schedule—which will afford Maxwell\nat least six weeks to investigate testifying witness\nstatements—allous Maxwell significantly more time\nto review disclosures than schedules adopted in most\ncases in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb,\nNo. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v.\nNachamie, 9l F.

In addition, on April l8,\n2o2l, the Government produced over 2o,ooo pages of\ninterview notes, reports and other materials related to\nnon-testifying witnesses. After considering the circum-\nstances, including the <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> of the issues in this\ncase and what the defense has already received and\nlikely learned in the course of discovery, the Court\nconcludes that the Government’s proposal is generally\nreasonable.\nD. Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final discovery request is for early\ndisclosure of evidence the Government seeks to offer\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule\n4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a criminal case intends to\nuse “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a\ndefendant, the prosecutor must “provide reasonable\nnotice of the general nature of any such evidence that\nthe prosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do\nso in writing before trial—or in any form during trial\nif the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial\nnotice.” The Government represents that it will notify\nthe defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least\n45 days in advance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any\n\nDOJ-OGR-Oooool5l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000152.jpg": "89a\n\nmotions in limine to be considered at the final pretrial\nconference. The Government’s proposal will give\nMaxwell an opportunity to challenge admission of that\nevidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any\nissues that require resolution before trial. “This is all\nthat Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson,\nNo. l3-cr-378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.\nDec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally reasonable, although additional time to\nenable briefing and resolution in advance of trial is\nstrongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel\npretrial disclosures does not preclude the parties from\nnegotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery\ntimeline that will account for Maxwell’s specific\nconcerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure\nwill redound to the benefit of all parties, counsel, and\nthe court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26,\nl32 (2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate a final, omnibus schedule to\npropose to the Court. The Court concludes that the\ndisclosure of all of the above materials approximately\nsix to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate\nand sufficient.\n\nGiven the complexities of the case and the addition\nof two counts via the S2 indictment, the Court\nencourages the parties to agree to approximately eight\nweeks.\n\nIX.

United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 239\nCir. l99o). Thus, “‘[iJn the absence of a specific shouing that disclosure [of a witness list] [is]\nboth material to the preparation of [the] defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances\nsurrounding [the] case,’ the request for a witness list should be denied.” United States v.

Rivera, No. l6 Cr. l75\n(LGS), 2ol7 WL l8433o2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol7).

Russo, 483 F.

As the Government has noted for some time nou, the\nGovernment intends to match or even go above and beyond that practice in this case. Specifically,\nthe Government has offered repeatedly to provide non-testifying witness statements to the defense\nas much as eight weeks before trial, thereby allouing extra time for the defense to determine\nwhether it wishes to call any of the witnesses the Government does not intend to present at trial,\nand to provide testifying witness statements and Giglio material as much as four weeks in advance\nof trial.

Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict.

The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel.

Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible.

Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l4 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 969\n\nl. Minimize false negatives. Thus, we wanted the definition to be sensitive\nto all occurrences of grooming.\n\n2. Minimize false positives. Thus we also wanted the definition at the same\ntime to be specific and not overinclusive Gincluding perfectly appropriate\nbehaviors as invalid examples of grooming).\n\n3. Be capable of providing the basis for a valid assessment procedure.\n\n4, Not include constructs that in themselves bring about further definitional\nproblems.\n\n5.

Allou the rater to have multiple choices regarding final decisions given\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> of individual cases, such as clearly grooming, probably\ngrooming, uncertain, or not grooming.\n\n8. Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl.

Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 45\nChild Abuse Review Vol. 24: l59-l69 (2ol5)\nPublished online 9 May 2ol5 in Wiley Online Library\n(wileyonlinelibrary.com) DOI: lo.loo2/car.228o\nPy Py ee\nDisclosure of Child Rosaleen McElvaney\nSchool of Nursing and Human\na Sciences, Dublin City University,\nSexual Abuse: Delays, Sc ed\nee\na\nNon-disclosure and\na a\nPartial Disclosure.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nDenial of Consent\nA key issue in sexual assault is whether consent was given for the sexual\ncontact. Consent is complex and, in real-world situations, may have signifi-\ncant variability and may be rather subtle and, in general, an intricate process.\nRarely do sexual interactions begin with individuals explicitly stating “I give\nyou permission to do x, y, and z” (Hall, l998). Consent in sexual situa-\ntions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t\nsay no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or\n“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and\nMuehlenhard (l999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than\nverbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knouledge of what is\nbeing consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent\nor not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s\n“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret\ndifferently. Houever, mistakes can be made in these situations and given\nthe motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be motivated (“I want this,\nso I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;\nI was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).\n\nUnderstanding whether consent was given is made more complex by\nthe fact that consent early in the interaction for a certain kind of sexual\ncontact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.\nIn addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all\nfuture contact. This <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> led to the infamous Antioch College consent\npolicy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and\nevery time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly\nask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,\nl996):\n\nIf the level of sexual intimacy increases during an interaction (.e., if two\n\npeople move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to\n\nundressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people\ninvolved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that\n\nnew level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of\n\nsexual intimacy in an interaction, that person is responsible for geting the\n\nverbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.\n\n(p. l37)\n\nThis policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it\nraises the question hou explicit and hou often does consent need to be\nconveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which\nthe alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be interpreted\nas providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize\nthis. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe\nconsent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6278", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo5\nIn this situation, the controversy is not whether sexual content occurred but\nwhether consent for this sexual content occurred.\n\nThe final level of <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> regarding this pathway occurs in the\natempt of professionals involved in the case to accurately understand after\nthe fact the details of whatever consent process did or did not take place.\nBy its nature, this will generally be a “he said, she said” mater in which it is\nvery difficult to resolve conflicting claims. Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 959\n\ncapture the notion of grooming because these already involve illegal and\n\nabusive contract with a child. Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the <span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6796", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l4 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 969\n\nl. Minimize false negatives. Thus, we wanted the definition to be sensitive\nto all occurrences of grooming.\n\n2. Minimize false positives.

Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">complexity</span> of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al. (2ol2) describe the importance for young people of\n. containing the secret of abuse and their need for confidentiality follouing\n‘An adaptive strategy disclosure as representing an adaptive strategy on the part of the young person\non the part of the to contain the experience and his/her emotional reaction to it.

Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions.

That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i).

Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section.

Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F.

In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses.

Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion seeking to dismiss the $l superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury\nsiting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury\ndrawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the\ncommunity, because her trial would proceed in the Manhatan Division. A grand jury siting in\nManhatan returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 2l, 2o2l, Maxwell shall shou\ncause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein’s\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the\nstatute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No.\nl37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the\nperjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to\ndismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial\ndisclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell’s motion to sever the perjury counts\nfor a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9).\n! The parties shall negotiate and propose a schedule for any available additional or supplement rulings in\nlight of the filing of the S2 indictment.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o792", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021167.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 7o, o4/26/2o23, 35o55l2, Paged of 8\n\nl3. On February 28, 2o23, Maxwell filed her opening brief on appeal,\nwhich contains approximately l9,95o words.\n\nl4. Maxwell’s brief raises at least five issues: (l) whether the indictment\nshould have been dismissed pursuant to a nonprosecution agreement signed by\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida;\n(2) whether all counts were barred by the applicable statute of limitations; (3)\nwhether a juror’s misstatements during voir dire deprived Maxwell of her right to a\nfair and impartial jury; (4) whether the District Court constructively amended two\ncounts of the indictment when responding to a jury note; and (5) whether the District\nCourt improperly applied an aggravating role adjustment when calculating the\napplicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range.\n\nl5.
