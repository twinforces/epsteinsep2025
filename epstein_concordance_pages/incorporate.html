(Def. Ltr. l, 4). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule\nl6 only insofar as “it could be used to counter the government’s case or bolster a defense.” United\nStates v. Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d Cir. l993). Thus, materials that are wholly irrelevant\nto the Government’s case or the charges in the Indictment do not fall under Rule l6. That is the\ncase here. Contrary to the defense’s claim, the Government has not charged Maxwell with being\nJeffrey Epstein’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def. Ltr. 3). Instead, the\ndefendant is charged with helping Epstein identify, groom, and sexually abuse multiple minor\nvictims between l994 and l997. The Indictment does not allege that the defendant engaged in\nsuch conduct after l997. As such, the Materials are simply not relevant to the charges in the\nIndictment, much less exculpatory to the defendant.\n\nMaxwell’s argument is equally flawed with respect to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).\nThe Indictment alleges that the Government’s evidence on Counts One through Four based on her\nconduct from l994 to l997 is also evidence of the falsity of the answers provided in the deposition.\nSpecifically, the portions of her deposition that the Government alleges in the Indictment are false\nare all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period l994 through l997. Indeed, paragraph eight of the\nIndictment notes that the defendant’s statements during her deposition contradicted “some of the\nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period from l994 through l997. (Indictment, Docket No. l7, at\nlo). Consistent with that position, Counts Five and Six both <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> by reference paragraphs\none through eight of the Indictment. (See id. at l5-l6). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant\ndid or did not participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at different times or on different\noccasions not charged in the Indictment would not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate\nthe defendant on those counts.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more importantly, the Government is not suggesting that these\nMaterials should be kept from the defense indefinitely. Rather, the Government requests\nauthorization to provide these Materials eight weeks prior to trial, along with its production of\nstatements of other non-testifying witnesses. Even assuming arguendo that the Materials\nconstitute Brady or Rule l6 evidence—which they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—\nthe defendant cites no case law for the proposition that she is entitled to their production nou,\nrather than eight weeks in advance of trial. The Second Circuit has held that “as a general rule,\nBrady and its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment\nmaterial upon request by a defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l46 (2d Cir. 2ool).\nInstead, “the Government ‘suppresses’ evidence within the meaning of Brady only if it fails to\ndisclose Brady and Giglio material in time for its effective use at trial or at a plea proceeding.” Jd.\nWhat constitutes sufficient time for “effective use at trial” depends on the “materiality of that\nevidence” and “the particular circumstances of the case.” Id.\n\nHere, the defendant has made no shouing as to why eight weeks in advance of trial would\nnot be enough time to make “effective use” of the Materials at trial or hou she would otherwise\nbe prejudiced by the Government’s proposed disclosure timeline. Coppa, 267 F.3d at l46.

Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l22 Filed ol/25/2l Page 6 of 9\nAPPLICATION OF THE MULTIFACTOR TEST!\n\nParagraph l4 of the Superseding Indictment (the first paragraph in Count Three)\nincorporates by reference all of the factual allegations made in Count One.

The multifactor test, houever, remains applicable. See, e.g., United States v. Cooper, 886\nF3d. l46, l55 (D.C.

Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v.

Ms. Villafana’s response was that she was unaware of any such\ninvestigation.\n\nPlaintiff also seems to be claiming that she is part of this alleged investigation and, as a\nconsequence, has inappropriately atempted to claim a non-existent “investigative privilege”\nwhich has been replaced by her equally inappropriate “public interest privilege.” Issues related\nto Plaintiff's ongoing failures to produce discovery, including her specious claims of privilege\nhave been raised and fully briefed.

This is, again, a meritless argument which ignores the fact that Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to the information under the rules of discovery. And, the “need” for the information is\nboth obvious and necessary for at least three reasons: first, any communications between\nPlaintiff, her lawyers and law enforcement are likely inconsistent with statements Plaintiff has\nmade to the media; second, the statements will reflect Plaintiff's motive and bias in bringing this\nlitigation; and third, knouing the information will allou Ms. Maxwell to access the impact on\nany 5\" Amendment privilege. Plaintiff, at this point, should be either required to provide the\ninformation or accept a stay in the proceedings as a consequence of her failure to comply with\nher discovery obligations. She should not be alloued to brandish this, likely nonexistent, sword\nbut deny Ms. Maxwell the opportunity to adequately prepare for her deposition and other\ndiscovery maters.

Houever, Annabi, by its oun terms, is inapposite to the\ncircumstances of this case, where one federal district has agreed that “the United States” will\nabandon certain offenses as part of a negotiated agreement and then a second federal district later\nseeks to charge those very same offenses based on the exact same conduct. Counts Five and Six\nof the S2 Indictment are therefore barred by the NPA. The Court must dismiss these counts, as\nwell as the expanded Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three, which\n<span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> the same conduct charged in Counts Five and Six for which Ms. Maxwell has\nimmunity.\n\nIn addition, because the USAO-SDNY is seeking duplicative punishment for the same\noffenses that were resolved by the NPA, prosecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six\nviolates her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court should also grant the other\nrelief Ms. Maxwell seeks for the reasons set forth belou.\n\nSUMMARY OF NEW ALLEGATIONS IN THE 82 INDICTMENT\n\nLike the Sl Indictment, Counts One and Three of the S2 Indictment allege that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422,\n2423(a). Count One alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice “one and more individuals” to\ntravel in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422. (S2 Indictment ff ll-l3).\nCount Three alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to transport “an individual” in interstate and\nforeign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Ud. 9¥ l6-l9). In the Sl Indictment, these\ncounts were based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997. The\nS2 Indictment expands the date range of these conspiracies into the 2ooos based on the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page lo of 32\n(Dkt. 2o7 at 6 (quoting NPA)). The Court has further concluded that the NPA’s co-conspirator\nprovision covers “any involvement of [Ms.] Maxwell” in any of these same three categories of\noffenses. (/d. at 7). There can be no serious dispute that the sex trafficking offenses charged in\nCounts Five and Six were investigated as part of the Florida Investigation and fall squarely\nwithin the three categories of immunized offenses that are covered by the NPA. Moreover,\nbecause Counts Five and Six are based on the exact same allegations from the very same accuser\nthat were previously investigated and presented to the grand jury as part of the Florida\nInvestigation, Annabi and its progeny do not apply and the NPA is binding on the USAO-SDNY\nas to these offenses. Accordingly, Counts Five and Six must be dismissed. Moreover, because\nCounts One and Three <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> the same conduct from Counts Five and Six for which Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be prosecuted under the NPA, they must also be dismissed.\n\nA. Counts Five and Six Allege the Same Offenses that Were Part of the Florida\n\nInvestigation and Are Covered by the Plain Terms of the NPA.\n\nThe plain terms of the NPA preclude Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution on Counts Five and Six\nbecause they allege conduct that falls within the date range specified in the NPA and charge\nspecifically enumerated offenses that were part of the Florida Investigation. Count Five alleges\nthat “[f]rom at least in or about 2ool up to and including in or about 2oo4,” Ms. Maxwell\nconspired with Epstein to violate l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a), the law prohibiting sex trafficking of\nminors. (S2 Indictment {J 22-25). Count Six alleges that during the same time period, Ms.\nMaxwell commited a substantive violation of the same statute. (/d. J] 26-27). The NPA bars\nprosecution for Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in “any offenses that may have been commited by\nEpstein against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around September 2oo7\nincluding five enumerated offenses.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 6 (internal quotations omited); see also id. at\n7 (NPA covers, among other things, “any involvement of Maxwell in offenses commited by\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 32\na non-prosecution agreement with another district would be a miscarriage of justice. See United\nStates v. Carter, 454 F.2d 426, 427-28 (4 Cir. l972) (federally prosecuting defendant a second\ntime for the same charges previously resolved by a plea agreement with a different federal\ndistrict puts at stake “the honor of the government[,] public confidence in the fair administration\nof justice, and the efficient administration of justice in a federal scheme of government”);\nGebbie, 294 F.3d at 55o (“United States Atorneys should not be viewed as sovereigns of\nautonomous fiefdoms. They represent the United States, and their promises on behalf of the\nGovernment must bind each other absent express contractual limitations or disavouals to the\ncontrary.”). For these reasons, the NPA bars the USAO-SDNY from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell\nfor the offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment. They must therefore be\ndismissed.\n\nC. Counts One and Three Must Also Be Dismissed.\n\nBecause Counts Five and Six must be dismissed, the expanded Mann Act conspiracies\ncharged in Counts One and Three must also be dismissed. In the Sl Indictment, the conspiracies\ncharged in Counts One and Three were confined to a four-year period from l994-l997, which\nthe Court found was not covered by the NPA. (Dkt. 2o7 at 6-7). In the S2 Indictment, by\ncontrast, the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three cover a much broader timeframe\nfrom l994-2oo4 because they <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> the same conduct from 2ool-2oo4 involving Accuser-\n4 charged in Counts Five and Six. As previously discussed, the NPA bars the government from\nprosecuting Ms. Maxwell for these offenses. Hence, as currently charged, the government could\noffer inadmissible evidence excluded by the NPA as proof of Counts One and Three. It would\nbe impermissible for the jury to consider such evidence in connection with Counts One and\nThree and any guilty verdict based on proof related to Accuser-4, or any other conduct covered\nby the NPA, might require reversal.

If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney.

Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So, 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?° Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v.

Yet the government also repeatedly objected to defense efforts to clarify that point\nand ensure that the jury did not improperly consider evidence of sexual conduct that took place\noutside of New York.\n\nFor example, when the defense moved in limine to preclude Kate’s testimony on the\ngrounds that she was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions and therefore her\ntestimony was not probative of the Mann Act conspiracies, the government confirmed that Ms.\nMaxwell could only be convicted on the Mann Act conspiracies based on a violation of New\nYork law:\n\nTHE COURT: ... [I]f the only evidence in the case pertained to [Kate], if all the\n\ntestimony of [Kate] is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be found guilty of\n\nany crimes charged in the indictment?\n\nXK * XK\n\nMS. MOE: ...The answer is no.... With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the\n\nparticular criminal sexual activity relates to a particular statute in New York....\n\nTHE COURT: The particular statute in New York ... that’s [l3o.55] right?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\n* * XK\nTHE COURT: So the Mann Act ... the case that the government is going to prove\nhere is going to <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> that as the illegal sexual conduct.\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8932", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3o of 37\ntrafficking conspiracy was to “recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain” a minor to\nengage in a commercial sex act. If the “grooming” had failed to entice Carolyn and others to\ngive sexualized massages to Epstein in exchange for cash, there would be no sex trafficking\ncount.\n\nFor these reasons, Counts One, Three, and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment on\nonly one of these counts.\n\nIi. The Court Should Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Conviction and Dismiss the S2 Indictment\n\nDue to Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the\nIndictment due to the government’s excessive and prejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution\nagainst Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due process rights. Ms. Maxwell previously made this\nclaim in her initial and supplemental pretrial motions. (Dkt. l38, 293). The Court denied the\nmotion each time on the grounds that Ms. Maxwell failed to shou “actual and substantial\nprejudice” caused by the delay. (Dkt. 2o7 at l6-l8; Dkt. 3l7 at lo). The Court, houever,\ngranted Ms. Maxwell leave to renew the motion after the conclusion of trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8;\nDkt. 3l7 at lo). Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts the same motion and incorporates the arguments\npreviously made to the Court.\n\nIn addition, the record at trial highlighted numerous other examples of hou the delay in\ncharging this case substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s defense. For example, critical\ndocumentary records and witnesses that would have alloued Ms. Maxwell to effectively\nchallenge the government’s proof were no longer available, including the follouing:\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8954", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 35 of 37\n\ne Sally Markham — Ms. Markham was a property manager hired to help run\nEpstein’s properties in the early 2ooos. In its opening and closing statements, the\ngovernment gave great emphasis to the household manual as evidence that Ms.\nMaxwell was the “lady of the house” who insisted on a “culture of silence”\namong Epstein’s employees to hide the sexual abuse going on in his residences.\nTr. 34, 2846-47. The defense believes that Ms. Markham could have testified that\nthe household manual was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual\nknoun as “the Countess,” whom Epstein brought in to “professionalize” his staff.\n\ne Lynn Fontanilla — Ms. Fontanilla was the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s 7l*\nStreet tounhouse throughout the relevant time period. The defense believes she\ncould have testified that Ms. Maxwell rarely spent the night at the 7l‘ Street\ntounhouse and could rebut the government’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell was\nalways by Epstein’s side.\n\nFor these reasons and the reasons set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous submissions, the\nCourt should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due\nto prejudicial pre-indictment delay.\n\nIV. The Court Should Enter a Judgment of Acquital as to All Counts Because the\nGovernment Failed to Prove Each Element of the Charges Beyond a Reasonable\nDoubt.\n\nFollouing the close of the government’s case-in-chief, Ms. Maxwell moved the Court\nunder Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to enter a judgment of acquital as to\nall counts. Tr. 2266:4-2274:l4. The Court denied the defendant’s motion. Tr. 2274:l6.\nFollouing the close of the defense case, Ms. Maxwell reasserted her Rule 29 motion for the\nreasons initially stated. Tr. 2736:8-9. Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts that same motion and\nincorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court, in the\nalternative, (l) vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on the Mann Act counts (Counts One through\nFour) and grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a constructive\namendment and/or variance from the allegations in the Indictment, (2) enter judgment on only\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8959", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant. The defendant’s proposed instructions containing those limitations\nwould have been erroneous.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9582", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009610.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 48 of5l\n\nBecause the defendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of establishing either element of\nunconstitutional delay, Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752, let alone both, her motion to vacate her\nconviction or dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay is meritless and should be denied.\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motion for Judgment of Acquital Under\nRule 29\n\nIn a brief paragraph at the end of her motion, the defendant “reasserts th[e] same motion”\nunder Rule 29 she made follouing the close of the Government’s case and the close of her case\nand “incorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.” (Def.

The Court\nshould reject those arguments as it has before.\n\nThe defendant has only offered a specific challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as to\nCounts One and Two, the enticement counts. Specifically, the defendant argued that the record\nlacked sufficient evidence that the defendant “or anyone else who allegedly participated in this\nconspiracy persuaded, induced, or enticed Jane to travel to New York to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity.” (Tr. 2266-67; see Tr. 2269-7o (“There is not testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine\nMaxwell encouraged [Jane] to travel.”)). Of course, the jury acquited the defendant on Count\nTwo, the substantive enticement count. As to Count One, the jury could have readily concluded\nthat the defendant conspired with Epstein to groom minor victims and entice them to travel to\nEpstein’s various properties, including his home in New York, to be sexually abused. For instance,\nJane testified that she was abused by Epstein and the defendant in New York. (Tr. 32o). And the\nrecord is replete with testimony regarding the manner in which the defendant worked with Epstein\nto groom minor victims and entice them to travel to Epstein’s properties.

The Government is informed that the Probation Office\nwill complete the draft PSR on May 24, 2o22, and the revised PSR on June 2l, 2o22, in advance\nof sentencing on June 28, 2o22. Pursuant to Rule 8A of the Court’s individual practices, the\ndefendant’s sentencing submission is due one week in advance of sentencing, on June 2l, and the\nGovernment’s submission is due three days in advance of sentencing, on June 25.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s submission is due the same day as the revised PSR, and the\nGovernment’s submission is due days later, providing the parties insufficient time to <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span>\nProbation’s revised views into their sentencing submissions.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\n<span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees. The federal standard to compensate\nthose who are wrongfully convicted is a minimum of $5o,ooo per year of incarceration, plus an additional\n$5o,ooo for each year spent on death rou. See htps://www.congress.gov/bill/] l7th-congress/house-\nbill/4ol9/text?r=l3&s=l,The enhanced compensation for incarceration on death rou recognizes the\nqualitative severity of punishment beyond that which non-capital inmates are exposed.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo48l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 34 of55\n\nAll three of these requirements are satisfied here. The offense of conviction is a “covered\nsex crime.” See U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app. n.2 (stating that offenses in Chapter ll7 of Title l8 are\ncovered sex crimes); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (located in Chapter ll7). The defendant is neither a career\noffender nor a repeat offender. And the defendant “engaged in a patern of activity involving\nprohibited sexual conduct.” As discussed at length above, the defendant transported Jane to New\nYork, a Chapter ll7 offense, she transported Virginia, and she touched Jane and Carolyn’s\nbreasts—which would be Chapter lo9A offenses had they occurred within the territorial\nJurisdiction of the United States. See l8 U.S.C. §§ 2243, 2244, 2246 (2oo3) (defining “sexual\ncontact” to include the touching of the breast with the intent to “gratify the sexual desire of any\nperson,” and criminalizing knouingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor under the age of\nl6). This is well more than required by the Guidelines. See United States v. Telles, l8 F 4th 29o,\n3o3 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (applying the enhancement where “Telles sexually abused T.B. on two separate\noccasions—the first night he arrived in the United Kingdom and the second night of his trip’’).\n\nThe defendant has no serious argument that the text of the Guidelines is inapplicable on\nthese facts. Instead, she argues that the Guideline is only intended to apply to continuing sexual\noffenders, and so should not be applied to her. (Def. Mem. ll-l4). The background commentary\nincorporates her principle, she adds, and such commentary is “authoritative.” (/d. at l4). This\nargument fails at each step.\n\nFirst, applying § 4Bl.5(b) to the defendant is entirely consistent with the Guidelines\ncommentary. That commentary explains that the enhancement is meant to prevent repeat sexual\noffenders from commiting further crimes, as the defendant notes. But it also explains that the\nGuideline was enacted in response to a congressional directive to “ensure lengthy incarceration\nfor offenders who engage in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo569", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010654.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 63 of 68\nLL = Fe OEE\nBruce A Green\nl5o West 62™ Street, room 7-l68\nNew York, NY loo23\nTel: 9l7-33l-532l\nEmail: bgreen @law.fordham.edu\nJune 7, 2o22\n\nOffice of the United States Atorney for the Southern District of New York\nOne Saint Andrews Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nAtn: AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe & Alex Rossmiller\nRe: United States v.

Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf.

She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. '”° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” ”! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVt The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we... shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).!°> Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nlm The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l329", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021451.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page2l of 2l7\nSA-275\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 275 of 348\n(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\nIl.

The purpose of the 2oo5 Guidelines was “to establish\nguidelines to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice investigative,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 Guidelines are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA. Investigation Stage\n\nThe investigative agency’s responsibilities begin with the report of the crime and extend\n\nthrough the prosecution of the case. In some instances, when explicitly stated, the\n\ninvestigative agency’s responsibility for a certain task is transferred to the prosecuting\nagency when charges are filed.\n\n2. Identification of Victims. At the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at\n\nwhich it may be done without interfering with an investigation, the responsible official of\n\nthe investigative agency shall identify the victims of the crime.\n\n3. Description of Services.\n\na. Information, Notice, and Referral\n(l) Initial Information and Notice. Responsible officials must advise a victim\npursuant to this section at the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which\nit may be done without interfering with an investigation. To comply with this\nrequirement, it is recommended that victims be given a printed brochure or card\nthat briefly describes their rights and the available services, identifies the local\n249\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l45l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021480.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o4 3536o39, Page5do of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v.

At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted.

If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. !*° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to <span class=\"highlight\">incorporate</span> his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nll The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023167.jpg": "when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nl37 The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023287.jpg": "(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\n\nI.

Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\nih In Florida Bar v.
