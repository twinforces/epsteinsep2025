That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means.

Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely <span class=\"highlight\">separated</span> from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services.

Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely\n<span class=\"highlight\">separated</span> from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per\nday, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC\nNew York SHU at l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.4 During their shift, they each created and submited falsified\nofficial BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and\nsigned more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 3o-minute rounds (often\n* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. on August 9, 2ol9, folloued by an overtime shift in the\nSHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.

At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a\nmanner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”\nBecause “[i]natention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other\nincidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.” BOP policy\nprovides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies\nthat personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official\nworking hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”\nB. False Statements and Lack of Candor\nUnder federal law, “whoever, in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3).

Special Housing Units\nSHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.2l-54l.33. These\nregulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely <span class=\"highlight\">separated</span> from the\ngeneral inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.ll, Special\nHousing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary\nsegregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023376.jpg": "Inmates in the SHU are securely <span class=\"highlight\">separated</span> from general population inmates and are kept locked in their cell\nwhen in their assigned tier within the SHU.

BOP policy provides that,\nweather and resources permiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters\n5 hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the\nopportunity to shouer at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates\nmay also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court\nappearances, medical and psychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all\nvisitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on\nwork details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought\ninto a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the\ninmate's locked cell door.\nBOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 3o continuous calendar days are to be examined\nand interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's adjustment and the threat\npresented to self or others.\nBOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other\nthings, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit. When a staff\nmember is assigned to the SHU at the last-minute and has not completed the quarterly training, the staff\nmember must be advised of the general requirements of a SHU post and be permited to ask questions\nabout the duties.\n2. Inmate Accountability”\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted.

This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nIl. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely <span class=\"highlight\">separated</span> from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York. BOP emails reflect that other atorneys expressed frustration to a Supervisory Staff Atorney with\nthe BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York because atorneys had to wait hours or were unable to\n2 As discussed in Chapter l, BOP policy provides that SHU inmates may be escorted from their cells by MCC New York\nstaff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and psychological atention, shouers, and recreation.\n\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023390.jpg": "meet with their clients because Epstein and his atorneys were occupying the atorney conference room,\neven at times when Epstein had to leave the conference room for a medical visit.\nAt MCC New York, the SHU was located on the south side of the institution’s ninth floor and was often\nreferred to as “9 South.” Primary access to the SHU was controlled by a locked door (Main Exterior Entry\nDoor). That door was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York's centralized Control Center.\nAccess into the SHU was further controlled by a second locked door (Main Interior Entry Door), to which a\nlimited number of Correctional Officers (CO) had keys while on duty.\nSecondary access to the SHU was controlled by a locked door. That door was opened remotely by a staff\nmember in the centralized Control Center. Entry into the SHU from the secondary access point was further\ncontrolled by three additional locked doors, to which a limited number of the COs had keys while on duty.\nThe secondary access doors were used only by staff when facilitating visits between the SHU inmates and\ntheir outside visitors.\nWithin the SHU, inmates were assigned to six separate tiers or groups of cells, three of which were\naccessible via stairs leading up from the common area on the ninth floor (Upper Tiers—G, J, and L Tiers) and\nthree of which were accessible via stairs leading doun from the common area on the ninth floor (Louer\nTiers—H, K, and M Tiers). The entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the\ntop or botom of the staircase leading to the individual tier.

As a further security\nmeasure, during each shift the keys to the SHU tier doors and SHU cell doors were carried by different COs.\nAs noted above, inmates in the SHU are securely <span class=\"highlight\">separated</span> from the general inmate population and are\nkept locked in their cell when in their assigned tier within the SHU. Witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates\nare locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that, weather and resources\npermiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside of their quarters 5 hours per calendar\nweek. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the opportunity to shouer at\nleast 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates may also be escorted from\ntheir cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and\npsychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all visitors to the SHU be\ndocumented in the SHU visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on work details,\nbe searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC New York SHU Post\nOrders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought into a SHU cellblock\nand that all meals be delivered through the cell door food slot of the locked cell door.\n\n23\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2339o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023462.jpg": "As detailed in Chapter 4 of this report, the SHU was a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates\nwere securely <span class=\"highlight\">separated</span> from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for\napproximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nAccess to the SHU was controlled by multiple locked doors.

As a further security measure, during each shift a\nlimited number of the COs had keys while on duty.\nBOP policy and practice require that all SHU inmates be locked in their cells overnight. The OIG found no\nevidence indicating that the door to Epstein’s cell or any other cell in the SHU tier in which Epstein was\nhoused was unlocked on the evening of August 9-lo, 2ol9, after SHU staff locked Epstein in his cell at\napproximately 8 p.m. SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were\nlocked in their cells for the evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could\nhave goten out of their cells. Epstein did not have a cellmate after Inmate 3 was transferred out of MCC\nNew York on August 9, and therefore Epstein was alone in his cell the evening of August 9-lo. The door to\nEpstein’s cell was visible from the SHU Officers’ Station, and CO Tova Noel and Material Handler\nMichael Thomas told the OIG that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell during their shift on August lo.\nBoth of them further described delivering breakfast to the L Tier at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo, and hou\nNoel unlocked the door to the L Tier, Thomas entered the L Tier and called for Epstein, and then Thomas\nunlocked his cell door when Epstein failed to respond. Additionally, the three inmates who were housed in\nthe same SHU tier as Epstein on August 9 and lo, and who had a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s\ncell from their cells, stated that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein\nto his cell on the evening of August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC\nNew York SHU.\nFurther, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common area of\nthe SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's video\nrecording issues that we detailed in Chapter 6. The OIG’s analysis of the recorded video did not identify any\nCOs (other than those assigned to the SHU during that timeframe or had a specific reason for visiting the\nSHU) or other individuals present in the common area of the SHU approach any of the SHU tiers, including\nthe L Tier where Epstein was housed, between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and approximately\n6:3o a.m. on August lo.

Inmate Accountability\"\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted.

This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count\nin the same manner. When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate's body and\nnot rely solely on movement or sound.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy.

Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public.

Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York.
