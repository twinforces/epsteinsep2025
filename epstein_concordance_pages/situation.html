As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes.

In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her\nspouse’s leter makes clear, after spending a few months away ae Ms. Maxwell\nnoved i so that she could i be within\ndriving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. A §\nl2) (“|Ghislaine| was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against\nher, but to be within driving distance of New York.”). Contrary to the impression given by the\ngovernment, Ms. Maxwell was not “changing locations on multiple occasions” as if she were a\nfugitive from justice. (Tr. 87).

Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-\nperson meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2ol9, and also\nin January and March 2o2o. The timeline atached to this submission illustrates the extent\nof these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an opportunity to be heard in the\nevent that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.\nWe were never given that opportunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern District of\nNew York, nor were we given any notice of her impending arrest.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001150.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNE n Die GMeholooo Aled 425o8) 26a Ragef 8 Ob 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance.

Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.).

That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

(See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.'

Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001162.jpg": "CaSede2ol er Co F3ZocAdNt n DieGmMehol ooo AFiled 425o8)/26a Ragec?d Gb 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States.

B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\nenforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections.

Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA.

Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001276.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAdNnt Tibsutrent l682 lF iO 83222/2agFlagec8 o642\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt.

This is not a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate.

Is that the implication you are making?\n\n6 MR. COHEN: No, I am not saying that, your Honor. I\n\n7 am not going that far. What I am saying is, when you have a\n\n8 client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the\n\n9 country despite an investigation, and the government instead\n\nlo chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early\nll instances your access to the client. It is complicated by the\nl2 COVID crisis and the other factors your Honor has pointed out\nl3 in Stephens and in Williams-—Bethea, and so it is very hard for\nl4 us to pull together this financial information, and we have\n\nl5 done it as quickly as we could before the court.

Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-\nperson meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2ol9, and also\nin January and March 2o2o. The timeline atached to this submission illustrates the extent\nof these contacts. (Ex. R).

Finally, France would be inclined to preserving the interests of the\nUSA for obvious diplomatic reasons.\n\ne With regard to timing, if the requested person has consented to extradition, the\nInvestigating Chamber must deliver its ruling no later than l4 working days after the\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 22 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n73. The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a principle of constitutional value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the international conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental principle\nrecognized by the laws of the Republic, having constitutional value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the principle against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French constitutional\nlaw, European law or international law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\nConclusion\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the procedure described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77.

The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002174.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l3 of 36\nFurther, and as set forth belou, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence,\nincluding contemporary documents and other witnesses.\n\nIn challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.\nAt the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested\nheavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago. (See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 2o of 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. As set forth in\nExhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the\nextradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for\nwhich extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\nenforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F.

Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

She must review millions of pages of\nunwieldy documents produced in various formats (native, image, text) one page at a time—with\nno filtering or organizing—and record millions of Bates numbers and notes of her review by\nhand on the limited amount of paper she is provided. And she is not permited to have any\nsupplies to organize the voluminous legal papers. Hard drives provided by the government have\nbeen mishandled by MDC staff (dropped on the floor and slammed on a cart) causing them to\nbecome degraded and unstable and to randomly shut doun. While the laptop does not solve all of\nthese issues, it performs far beter than the MDC computers. The time, resources and funds\nexpended on problems caused by the electronic discovery and the computers is unnecessary,\nwasteful, and frustrating. The MDC is in no position - and is neither qualified nor experienced -\nto challenge Ms. Maxwell’s and her counsel’s claim that she needs access to the laptop on the\nweekends and holidays to even hope to finish reviewing the millions of pages of documents\nproduced in discovery.\n\nThe MDC’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell’s access to her atorneys is a reason to deny her\naccess to the laptop computer on weekend and holidays is non-sensical. One has absolutely\nnothing to do with the other. And it ignores the fact that, aside from time to review discovery or\ncommunicate with counsel, Ms. Maxwell is far more restricted than all other MDC inmates.\nOther inmates have unlimited time to communicate with other inmates. With exception of\ninmates detained in the SHU for disciplinary reasons, all other MDC inmates have unlimited\ntime to interact with other inmates. Other than calls with family or communication with counsel,\nMs. Maxwell has no human contact except with guards who wield pouer over her, overmanage\nher, and have psychologically and physically abused her. And complaints regarding\nmistreatment by guards have led to reprisals against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nRather than state a valid reason for opposing the Court’s directive, the MDC’s opposition\nshines a klieg light on the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all\ninmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes\nbeyond deprivation of liberty.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB.

See\nShular, l4o S.Ct. at 785; Kawashima vy. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 (2ol2) (interpreting “offenses\nthat involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or\ndeceitful conduct’) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4)\n(stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to look to the elements and the\nnature of the offense . . .rather than to the particular facts” at issue); see also United States v.\nDavis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (“In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a\nstatutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.”). Thus, only if the offense “necessarily entails” the\nidentified conduct can it be said to be an “offense involving” that conduct. Kawashima, 565 U.S.\nat 484.\n\nIn United States v. Morgan, the D.C. Circuit used this approach in interpreting l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3237(a), a venue statute that applies to “[a]ny offense involving the use of the mails,\ntransportation in interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into\nthe United States.” The court concluded that “[t]he most natural reading” of the statute is “‘to\nconstrue ‘any offense involving’ by reference to the e/ements of the offense at issue.” 393 F.3d\nl92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4) (emphasis in original). The court then gave an illustrative example of\na case in which a defendant travels in interstate commerce, commits a federal offense, and then\nreturns home via interstate commerce:\n\n[T]he circumstances surrounding the crime include [the defendant’s] travel in\n\ninterstate commerce, but his crime is not an “offense involving” transportation in\n\ninterstate commerce. In other words, a faithful reading of the precise words of the\n\nstatute in the order in which they are writen suggests that an “offense involv[es]”\n\ntransportation in interstate commerce only when such transportation is an element\n\nof the offense.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 4 of 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 3 of l2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial.

But to the extent that it is not or there are other materials -- and this may be bad for our\nargument, but in all transparency and candor, I think there may be other individuals who also relied\non the protective order.” (/d.).

Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the Protective Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\nconcluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller. The relevant order was\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll7 of 239\n\nThe defendant repeatedly argues that the Government’s failure to mention AUSA-l’s prior\ncontact with Boies Schiller in 2ol6 was a misrepresentation that led to the modification of the\nprotective order. The argument, which relies principally on hyperbolic rhetoric, is simply\nincorrect. As an initial mater, the Government did not insist, contrary to Maxwell’s twisted\nreading of the transcript, that “there had been no contact whatsoever” between Boies Schiller and\nthe Government at any time prior to the Government opening its investigation. (Def. Mot. 3 at l).\nInstead, Chief Judge McMahon’s question was more specific: referencing Chemical Bank and the\ndesire to avoid “a Chemical Bank kind of <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” Chief Judge McMahon asked about contacts\nbetween the two parties “prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation.”\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added); see also Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (omiting the italicized portion\nof the question)). In response, the Government described accurately its communications with\nBoies Schiller that had occurred in the time period surrounding the opening of its investigation and\nthe issuance of the subpoena. Additionally, and in light of the Government’s prior arguments to\nChief Judge McMahon relating to Chemical Bank,*® the Government atempted to address the\nmisconduct at issue in that case: namely the production of confidential documents without seeking\nmodification of a protective order by confirming that, here, no such production had yet occurred.\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2) (noting that Boies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there\n* See, e.g., Exs. 8 & 9 at 2-3 (discussing Chemical Bank as rejecting a contempt request where a\nparty “compl[ied] with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order” and\nfocusing arguments on the nature of the production of documents); (Def.

Indeed, there is no reason to believe that a description of the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether\nshe was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.” (Def.

In response, a grand jury subpoena was issued and “confidential documents were produced by\nthe defendant without complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the\n[confidentiality] orders.” Jd. Here, by contrast, the Government accurately conveyed to Chief\nJudge McMahon the opening of its investigation in late 2ol8, the reason it made contact with Boies\nSchiller shortly thereafter and served a subpoena in February 2ol9, and that no documents\ngoverned by the protective order had yet been produced. Aside from rank speculation loosely\npremised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her\nassertion that “Boies Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def.

The court found that the protective order served\nthe “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted\nthe use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the\ndeposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 7oo; see also\nBotha v.

Giuffre moved to compel the defendant to answer, explaining that “[a]t the core of\n[her] allegations is the allegation that [the] Defendant lured her into a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> with the\noffer of a job making money as a massage therapist; that Epstein always habitually tried to turn\nmassages into sex .. . and that Maxwell recruited other females for an ostensibly proper position,\nsuch as therapeutic masseuse, with knouledge that the intent was for that person would be\npressured to provide sexual gratification to Epstein.” (l5 Civ. 7443 (LAP), Dkt.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo332l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v.

Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR- oooo333l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.” In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\nDe The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo334l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 256 of 348\nan instance in which Wild “asked a question that wasn’t answered” of anyone in the USAO or of\nthe FBI case agents.\n\nEdwards contacted Villafafia by email and telephone in mid-June, stating that he had\n“information and concerns that [he] would like to share.”*** In his affidavit, Edwards alleged that\nduring multiple telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage\nthe investigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because\nthe mater “was an on-going active investigation[.]’” Edwards atested that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and [in] complexity.”°”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia said that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring these interactions with Edwards, which occurred before the state court plea:\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> — Epstein was still challenging\nour ability to prosecute him federally, pressing allegations of\nprosecutorial misconduct, and trying to negotiate beter plea terms,\nwhile the agents, my supervisors, and I were all moving touards\n[filing charges] — I did not feel comfortable sharing any information\nabout the case. It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”°°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003526.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2of6\n\ne LP directed AK to “they will send me affidavits and depositions” on page 8 of AK’s\nnotes and asked if AK recalls what that line refers to and whether the atorneys sent AK\nany such materials.\n\no AK does not recall what that line refers to.\n\no AK does not recall if the atorneys sent her any such materials after the meeting.\n\no AK does not believe the atorneys provided her any materials during the meeting.\n\no AK has a vague memory that the atorneys sent her something by email, but does\nnot recall what it was.\n\n= One of the emails LP sent to AK was an email from Skinner to AK the\nevening of February 29, 2ol6 after the meeting sending AK documents.\nAK does not remember the particular documents she received.

Doubling doun on an increasingly\nfarfetched story, houever, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it\nmisrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York.\n\nContrary to the government’s portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor\nfrom the public corruption unit of the United States Atorney’s Office, in an ex parte proceeding,\naffirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of\nher colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell.\n\nHad the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would\nnever have obtained the 9o,ooo pages of material it nou possesses, material that is central—\nindeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention\ninjustice, to allou the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government\ncould not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge.\n\n“Tn a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> like this, the judiciary . . . may exercise its supervisory pouer to make it\nclear that the misconduct was serious, that the government’s unwillingness to oun up to it was\nmore serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events.”\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 2o of 34\n\nI want to make sure I'm not in a Chemical Bank{'>] kind of <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, so I would\n\nlike to knou about contacts between the United States Atorney's Office and the\n\nBoies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your\n\ninvestigation.\nId.

On the contrary—the Government has\n\nadvised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties\n\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the\n\nGovernment that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its\n\nfiles because of the existence of the Protective Order.

The NPA Binds the Southern District of New York as to Counts Five and Six.\n\nAlthough the Court ruled that the NPA does not bind the USAO-SDNY as to the charges\nin the Sl Indictment (Dkt. 2o7 at 4-6), the NPA does bind the USAO-SDNY as to the sex\ntrafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six that were added to the S2 Indictment.\nUnited States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (l985) and its progeny, which the Court relied upon in its\nearlier ruling, do not mandate a different result. In its prior ruling, the Court noted that Annabi\nestablished “something akin to a clear statement rule” that a plea agreement binds only the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the district in which the plea is entered “unless it affirmatively appears that\nthe agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 4 (quoting Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672).

Accordingly, the Court is not bound by the rule in Annabi because Counts Five\nand Six are identical to the charges presented to the SDFL grand jury that were resolved by the\nNPA. When examined without the overlay of Annabi, the terms and the drafting history of the\nNPA indicate that the agreement should be read to preclude other districts, including the USAO-\n° Accuser-4’s statements to the FBI, and any other prior statements in which she did not mention Ms. Maxwell, are\nexculpatory Brady material that the government should immediately produce to the defense.

Houever, the\nCourt highlighted the apparent anomaly of this rule, noting that an agreement with “the\nGovernment” to dismiss counts of an indictment “might be thought to bar the United States from\nreprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the agreement expressly limits\nthe scope of the agreement to the district in which the dismissed charges are initially brought.”\nId. The Court further explained that application of the “affirmative appearance” rule was\nnevertheless appropriate because it had not been presented with a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> where the counts in\nthe second prosecution were identical to the dismissed counts. /d. Although the defendants had\nargued that the charges in Counts One and Three of the SDNY indictment “result[ed] from the\nsame conspiratorial agreement” as the dismissed counts in the EDNY indictment, the Court\nfound that the SDNY charges covered conduct “extending more than two years beyond the date\nof the period covered by the dismissed charges,” are were therefore “not the same as the charges\nthat were dismissed.” /d.

The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 65 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4443\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l53 of 349\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l56 of 349\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So, 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?° Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6l of 349\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l66 of 349\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo et seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 228 of 349\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 257 of 349\nan instance in which Wild “asked a question that wasn’t answered” of anyone in the USAO or of\nthe FBI case agents.\n\nEdwards contacted Villafafia by email and telephone in mid-June, stating that he had\n“information and concerns that [he] would like to share.”*** In his affidavit, Edwards alleged that\nduring multiple telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage\nthe investigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because\nthe mater “was an on-going active investigation[.]” Edwards atested that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and [in] complexity.”*”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia said that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring these interactions with Edwards, which occurred before the state court plea:\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> — Epstein was still challenging\nour ability to prosecute him federally, pressing allegations of\nprosecutorial misconduct, and trying to negotiate beter plea terms,\nwhile the agents, my supervisors, and I were all moving touards\n[filing charges] — I did not feel comfortable sharing any information\nabout the case. It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\n\nA48 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”\noe Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, 4lol June 6, 2ol7).\n\n23o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and .. . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 6 of 26\nas multiplicitous remains premature.

Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court concluded, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this conclusion, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the similarity\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already concluded that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo _ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 3 of 32\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

She contends that even an inadvertent misstatement to a\ncourt requires suppression of evidence obtained as a result. She further seeks an evidentiary\nhearing to explore whether any misrepresentation by the Government in that hearing was\nintentional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts have a limited inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence obtained in “willful disobedience of law.” United States v. Payner, 447 USS.\n727, 735 n.7 (l98o) (quoting McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 345 (l943)). But it has\nalso cautioned that courts must exercise this pouer with restraint. /d.

Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), where a party in civil litigation urged\nprosecutors to instigate a criminal investigation and then provided confidential documents in\nviolation of a protective order. To that end, she asked the Government to explain “contacts\nbetween the United States Atorney’s Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of\nthe subpoena on the subject of your investigation.” The prosecutor at that hearing informed\nJudge McMahon about all communications between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and BSF after\nthe current investigation began—namely, that the Government told the firm that it intended to\nmake a document request and that the firm told the Government that some of the materials were\nsubject to a protective order. Although the prosecutor was included on an email several months\nearlier from the AUSA who met with Giuffre’s atorneys in 2ol6, he did not inform Judge\nMcMahon about any communications with BSF before the current investigation began.\n\nMaxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government’s\nstatement was a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 37 of 8o\ndrink or a pill, often at Cosby’s insistence; that each woman became incapacitated and\nunable to consent to sexual contact; and that Cosby sexually assaulted each woman\nwhile each was under the influence of the intoxicant. /d. at lo3-o4. These “chilling\nsimilarities,” the court explained, rendered Cosby’s actions “so distinctive as to become\na signature,” and therefore the evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan,\nscheme, or design. /d. at lo4.\n\nThe court further determined that the prior bad acts evidence was admissible to\ndemonstrate that Cosby’s actions were not the result of mistake or accident. The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were proffered as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the conclusion that [Cosby] found himself in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d. Accordingly, “the fact that numerous other women recounted the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 47 of 8o\nThe decisions belou, barring prosecution of the Stipetiches, embodied\nconcern that allouing charges to be brought after George Stipetich had\nperformed his part of the agreement by answering questions about sources\nof the contraband discovered in his residence would be fundamentally unfair\nbecause in answering the questions he may have disclosed information that\ncould be used against him. The proper response to this concern is not to\nbar prosecution; rather, it is to suppress, at the appropriate juncture, any\ndetrimental evidence procured through the inaccurate representation that\nhe would not be prosecuted.\n\nId. at l296. Although the Superior Court dismissed this passage from Stipetich as dicta,\nit found the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> distinguishable in any event inasmuch as former D.A. Castor testified\nthat there was no “agreement” or “quid pro quo” with Cosby, and, therefore, any reliance\nthat Cosby placed upon the district atorney's promise was unreasonable. Cosby, 224\nA.3d at 4l6-l7.\n\nThe Superior Court concluded that it was bound by the trial court’s factual findings\nand by its credibility determinations. The trial court had “determined that Mr. Castor’s\ntestimony and, by implication, Atorney Schmit’s testimony (which was premised upon\ninformation he indirectly received from Mr. Castor) were not credible.” /d. at 4l7. The\npanel added that the trial court had “found that the weight of the evidence supported its\nfinding that no agreement or grant of immunity was made, and that [Cosby] did not\nreasonably rely on any overtures by Mr. Castor to that effect when he sat for his civil\ndeposition.” /d. Thus, the Superior Court discerned no error in the trial court’s decision\nto allou the use of Cosby’s deposition testimony against him at trial.'®\nng In addition to the Rule 4o4(b) and non-prosecutions claims, the Superior Court\nrejected a number of other issues raised by Cosby, including an assertion of improper\njuror bias, a challenge to an allegedly misleading jury instruction, and a contention that\nSORNA was unconstitutional. Cosby, 224 A.3d at 396, 42l-43l. Because those issues\nare not relevant to the maters before us, we need not discuss them herein.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4859\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6l of 8o\n\nAn entirely different <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> arises when the decision not to prosecute is\nunconditional, is presented as absolute and final, or is announced in such a way that it\ninduces the defendant to act in reliance thereupon. When a non-prosecution decision is\nconveyed in such a way, and when a defendant, having no indication to the contrary,\ndetrimentally relies upon that decision, due process may warrant preclusion of the\nprosecution. Numerous state and federal courts have found that a defendant's\ndetrimental reliance upon the government's assurances during the plea bargaining phase\nboth implicates his due process rights and entitles him to enforcement even of\nunconsummated agreements. The cases are legion.*°\nae See, e.g., State v.

Johnson, 36o S.W.3d lo4, ll5 (Ark. 2olo) (holding that, “when\nthe State has entered into an agreement not to prosecute with a prospective defendant\nand the defendant has performed and acted to his detriment or prejudice in reliance upon\nthat agreement, the government must be required to honor such an agreement.”); People\nv. Rhoden, 89 Cal. Rptr.2d 8l9, 824 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. l999) (explaining “unexecuted\nplea bargains generally do not involve constitutional rights absent detrimental reliance on\nthe bargain”); United States v. Streebing, 987 F.2d 368, 372-73 (6th Cir. l993) (holding\nthat the defendant had to demonstrate, inter alia, that he had relied upon the\ngovernment’s promise to his detriment before the promise would be enforceable); United\nStates v. Savage, 978 F.2d ll36, ll38 (9th Cir. l992) (explaining that a defendant’s\ndetrimental reliance is an exception to the general rule that defendants are not entitled to\nenforcement of unconsummated plea agreements); State v. Parkey, 47l N.W.2d 896,\n898 (loua App. l99l) (finding that, in the absence of a shouing that the defendant\ndetrimentally relied upon an agreement with the prosecutor, dismissal was not\nwarranted); Roue v. Griffin, 676 F.2d 524, 528 (llth Cir. l982) (stating that, when a\npromise induces a defendant to waive his Fifth Amendment rights by testifying or\notherwise cooperating with the government to his detriment, due process requires that\nthe prosecutor's promise be fulfilled); People v. Reagan, 235 N.W.2d 58l, 587 (Mich.\nl975) (noting that, where the defendant was prejudiced by submiting to a polygraph in\nexchange for an agreement that his prosecution would be dismissed, trial court erred in\nrefusing to enforce the agreement).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 76 of 8o\notherwise cooperating with the government to his detriment, due process requires that\nthe prosecutor's promise be fulfilled). In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-2 Filed o7/o2/2l Page3of4\n2\nXJ49HGJIS SEALED - DO NOT DOCKET\n' l (In the. robing room)\n2 THE COURT: This is l9 Misc. l49, In Re Grand Jury\n3 Subpoena.

Nothing in this record suggests to me that :\nGiuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |\njury to look into the maters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the |\nGovernment has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |\nthat it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |\nexistence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |\nmoment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |\nMoreover, the Assistant United States Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |\nwhat is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood |\non his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. |\nThe literal terms of the Protective Order permit the court to authorize the release of |\n:\nConfidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shoun.” (Protective Order, {[ l4.) :\nAny party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |\nMaterials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |\nduly empouered grand jury seeks their production.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo895 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4945 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 27\n.

In )\nMartindell itself, for example, the Second Circuit found no extraordinary circumstance because |\n“the Government, by discharging the grand jury investigating the maters in connection with |\nwhich the Government sought the witnesses’ deposition transcripts, apparently chose not to use |\ngrand jury investigative processes to obtain their testimony.” 594 F.2d at 296 n.5, Therefore, |\nthe mere unavailability of the information was not extraordinary. Similarly, in Nosik v. Singe, 4o |\nF.3d 592 (2d Cir. l994), the Circuit again declined to find that the Government had made a :\nshouing of extraordinary circumstance, explaining, “[T]he possibility that [an individual] might |\none day invoke the Fifth Amendment at her criminal trial does not automatically create for |\nprosecutors a compelling need for the testimony that [the individual] might have given [in the |\ncivil proceeding]... [.] Prosecutors often make do without the testimony of a defendant.” Jd. at |\n595-96 (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296). |\nHere, houever, the extraordinary amount of publicity surrounding all aspects of what I |\nwill call the Epstein mater does create practical limitations to the grand jury’s ability to secure |\ncertain information with the secrecy it requires to conduct an appropriately thorough and |\nthoughtful investigation. Moreover, it does not appear to this Court that we are in a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> in |\nwhich the Government seeks information merely to “ascertain the truth of much of what it has |\nindependently discovered.” Minpeco, 832 F.2d at 743.

This psychological dynamic between a victim of child sexual abuse and her abusers is\n“beyond the knouledge of the average juror and would or could plainly be helpful in understanding\nthe psychological dynamics at play.” Oct. l7, 2ol9 Tr. at 27:3-7, United States v.

Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def.

(Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 84\nGovernment’s notice is remediated by this brief. This is ample notice of the possible Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence in this case. Indeed, the Rule only requires that the defense receive notice “before trial,”\nor even “during trial . . . for good cause.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3)(C).\n\nThe defense claims, without supporting authority, that Rule 4o4(b) requires heightened\nnotice that cannot be satisfied here without, essentially, a script of all of the proposed testimony at\ntrial accompanied by detailed expositions of the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Mot. 2 at 4-\n5). But the Government has provided the defense with marked exhibits and comprehensive Jencks\nAct materials of the single witness subject to this motion (approximately 4oo pages) “unusually\nearly” (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt. No. 353), along with a leter specifically highlighting the\nproffered evidence at trial. That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2ol9) (citing\nRodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty, Inc., 788 F.3d 3l, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol5)). Accordingly, the only judge\nin this District to consider a similar <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> concluded that the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice\nwas sufficient in combination with the Government’s motion papers. See United States v.\nChandler, No. l9 Cr. 867 (PKC), 2o2l WL l85l996, at *2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l).\n\nThe defense vaguely asserts that it cannot perform an independent investigation into the\nRule 4o4(b) evidence due to the inadequacy of the Government’s notice. (Def. Mot. 2 at 5-6).\nThat conclusory assertion cannot support a motion to preclude the jury from hearing evidence of\nthe defendant’s guilt.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5877\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N.

Repeated violations of the child’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming.

Bathing a young child by a legitimate caregiver without any inappropriate\n\ntouching.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005930.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 45\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\n\nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 4o and 5o for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.

Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found\nthat although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full\naccounting of her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not\nopaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That conclusion was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87).

The Court found that measures in place were sufficient\nto ensure the defendant’s access to her counsel, but also directed the Government to work with the\ndefense “to provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and stated that the\ndefense may make specific applications to the Court for further relief if the process was\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).\n\n2.

The Court found that the arguments\npresented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and\nthat no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2). The Court explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and\n\ncarry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence\n\nproffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\n\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that\n\ndoes not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in\n\nhiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important\n\nties, has not been fully candid about her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.\n(/d. at 2).

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8 of 29\n\nlo2 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\ncourse of l year in which all three men were charged with rape and pub-\nlicly vilified. The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual assault. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page lo of 29\nlo4 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nDenial of Consent\nA key issue in sexual assault is whether consent was given for the sexual\ncontact. Consent is complex and, in real-world situations, may have signifi-\ncant variability and may be rather subtle and, in general, an intricate process.\nRarely do sexual interactions begin with individuals explicitly stating “I give\nyou permission to do x, y, and z” (Hall, l998). Consent in sexual situa-\ntions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t\nsay no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or\n“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and\nMuehlenhard (l999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than\nverbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knouledge of what is\nbeing consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent\nor not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s\n“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret\ndifferently. Houever, mistakes can be made in these situations and given\nthe motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be motivated (“I want this,\nso I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;\nI was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).\n\nUnderstanding whether consent was given is made more complex by\nthe fact that consent early in the interaction for a certain kind of sexual\ncontact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.\nIn addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all\nfuture contact. This complexity led to the infamous Antioch College consent\npolicy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and\nevery time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly\nask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,\nl996):\n\nIf the level of sexual intimacy increases during an interaction (.e., if two\n\npeople move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to\n\nundressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people\ninvolved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that\n\nnew level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of\n\nsexual intimacy in an interaction, that person is responsible for geting the\n\nverbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.\n\n(p. l37)\n\nThis policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it\nraises the question hou explicit and hou often does consent need to be\nconveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which\nthe alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be interpreted\nas providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize\nthis. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe\nconsent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo5\nIn this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, the controversy is not whether sexual content occurred but\nwhether consent for this sexual content occurred.\n\nThe final level of complexity regarding this pathway occurs in the\natempt of professionals involved in the case to accurately understand after\nthe fact the details of whatever consent process did or did not take place.\nBy its nature, this will generally be a “he said, she said” mater in which it is\nvery difficult to resolve conflicting claims. Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical\n\nassault (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\npersonality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault\nclaim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or from other\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l8 of 29\n\nLl2 J. Engle and W. O’Donobue\n\nindividuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stim-\nulating to a person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations IT\nfocused and suggestive questions may elicit both agreement with inter-\nviewer assumptions and confabulations, thereby decreasing the accuracy\nof responses (Cederborg & Lamb, 2oo8; Clare & Gudjonsson, l993; Joyce,\n2oo3; Kebbel & Haton, l999; Kebbel, Haton, & Johnson, 2oo4). Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after suggestive questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\nsuggestive questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 29\n\nl2o J.

First, that perpetrators\nof sexual abuse of minors frequently use manipulation or coercion short of physical force as part\nof a strategic patern, often referred to as grooming, to make the minor vulnerable to abuse.\nSecond, that manipulation and grooming can prevent the minor from understanding their\nexperience as abuse and so prevent disclosure. Third, that abuse can cause long-term traumatic\nand psychological consequences. Fourth, that the presence of another individual can facilitate\nsexual abuse of minors. And fifth, that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse and that memory can be affected by a variety of factors,\nincluding the effects of trauma.\n\nThe Defense does not contest that Dr. Rocchio has the qualifications to express opinions\non these subjects. Dr. Rocchio has a PhD in clinical psychology and is a clinical instructor at the\nAlpert Medical School of Broun University. She has more than two decades of experience\ntreating hundreds of victims of trauma, many of which were minor victims of sexual abuse. She\nhas published peer-reviewed articles on trauma and sexual abuse and has given numerous talks in\naddition to her teaching.

For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N.

In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser.

Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found.

This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 45\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\n\nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 4o and 5o for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental Disorders Associated with Sexual Assault: A\nMeta-Analysis, 2l Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2o), pp. loll-lo28. Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations.

A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma.

Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s discretion to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt. The exercise of the trial judge’s discretion to grant\nchallenges for cause on the basis of inferred bias is especially appropriate\n\nin such situations.\n\nId. at 47 (emphasis added).\n\nJust as it is “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror\nhas engaged in “activities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial,” so too\nis it “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror has been\nsubject to conduct “that closely approximate[d] [that] of the defendant on trial.” See id. In\nsuch a case, there ls just too great a risk that such a juror will not be able to decide the\ncase purely based on the applicable law and the evidence or lack of evidence, even\nthough that inability may be unconscious.

Actual bias\n\n“Actual bias is “bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43\n(citing United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “A juror ls found by the judge\nto be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page6ofl2\n\nI. JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law. Cf.\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 288 (l999) (“[U]nder Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has\nthe same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment. ‘If the suppression\nof evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the\ncharacter of the prosecutor.’”) (internal citation omited).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellofl2\nnotwithstanding these prejudices he is determined to listen to the evidence, and be governed by it;\nbut the law will not trust him.” Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 5o. Such a juror “may declare that he feels no\nprejudice in the case; and yet the law cautiously incapacitates him from serving on the jury because\nit suspects prejudice, because in general persons in a similar <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> would feel prejudice.” Jd.\n\nIn addition to these situations in which bias must be implied, there are situations where\nbias may be inferred. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of\npartiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror\nfor cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s media statements establish both implied and inferred bias. The average\nperson who was sexually victimized and had Juror 5o’s feelings about the crime and those who\ncomplain about it could not be fair, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. To borrou\nChief Justice Marshall’s phrase, Juror 5o should have been “cautiously incapacitate[d]” from\nserving on this jury.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Court should not allou any juror to thwart its screening process by giving inaccurate\nanswers and thereby create such a grave potential, realized in this case, for depriving the defendant\nof her right to a fair trial.

Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). This rule promotes “the public interest in\nmaintaining both the finality of verdicts and full and free discussion within the confines of the jury\nroom.” United States v. Radonjich, l F.3d ll7, l2o (2d Cir. l993).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBased on the current record, the defendant has failed to satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test. Houever, the Government consents to a limited hearing, as set forth in more\ndetail in Part II, infra.\n\nl. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the First Prong of McDonough\na. The Defendant Must Prove a Deliberate Falsehood\n\nThe defendant argues that, under the McDonough test, “[a]n intentionally false answer\nduring voir dire is not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial.” (Def. Mem. at 23). This argument\nis foreclosed by binding Second Circuit precedent, which requires “dishonesty,” i.e., a deliberate\nfalsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake. Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6. “In other words,\nthe Court must assess whether [the juror] deliberately lied or consciously deceived the Court, as\nopposed to providing inaccurate responses as a result of a mistake, misunderstanding or\nembarrassment.” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 437 (W.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (citing Shaoul,\n4l F.3d at 8l5), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l). That rule\nexists for good reason: “To invalidate the result of a three-week trial because of a juror’s mistaken,\nthough honest response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial\nsystem can be expected to give.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nIn Shaoul, the Second Circuit considered McDonough and, specifically, its holding “‘that\nto obtain a new trial in. . . a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> [where a juror makes a mistaken response to a question], a\nparty must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and impartial. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to circumstances in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 28 of 49\n\nalso decline to hold as a general mater that, where a juror has\n\nengaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant at trial, the trial\n\njudge must presume bias. Such cases are unlikely to present the\n\n“extreme situations” that call for mandatory removal.\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46; see also id. at 46 & n.ll (rejecting A//sup decision from Ninth Circuit that\ncourt must presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences were biased”). Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\ninconsistent with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that similarity of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the combination of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, similarity of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l6l, l66-68 (lst Cir. 2ol3); see also Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-\n2o (7th Cir. l992) (citing combination of factors in “extreme” case where two jurors were\nburglarized during deliberations and then changed their votes as a result, and stating that “our\nholding is limited to the very unique facts stated herein” and “[iJt is unlikely these rare\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 3l of 49\ni. Inferred Bias\n\nWhile the category of cases in which bias must be implied or presumed is limited to\n“exceptional” or “extreme situations,” the district court retains discretion to dismiss a juror for\ncause when “a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to\nwarrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46-47. This doctrine of “inferred bias” is\n“closely linked” to the “traditional categories” of actual and implied bias, and a finding of inferred\nbias is permited “‘only after having received responses from the juror that permit an inference that\nthe juror in question would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Jd. at 47. “[A] finding\nof inferred bias is, by definition, within the discretion of the trial court.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\nAnd, as with actual bias, “a district court’s evaluation of the juror’s impartiality is accorded\ndeference.” /d.; see also id. (“There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined\nto disturb a trial judge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for\ncause in the empanelling of a jury.” (quoting United States v. Ploof, 464 F.2d ll6, ll8-l9 n.4 (2d\nCir. l972))).\n\nHere, the record refutes any suggestion that, had Juror 5o disclosed a history of sexual\nabuse, the Court would have struck him based on a finding of inferred bias. As set forth above,\nthe record is clear that the Court would have in fact conducted targeted follou-up questioning and,\nabsent some indication in such questioning that would have permited an inference of bias, the\nCourt would not have struck him. See Torres, l28 F.3d at 47 (finding of inferable bias “must be\ngrounded in facts developed at voir dire’).\n\nTorres, upon which the defendant exclusively relies, is not to the contrary. In that case,\nthe district court struck a juror for cause where she had engaged in the structuring of cash deposits,\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009248.jpg": "Case PAS CIOOSSO- PEL TBOCUEA AN 4d FiledWz/24/22gePagee 26 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nPAUL M.

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n 3See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d). in my view, its mandate appears duplicative of a\nlawyer's obligations under New York and Model Rule 3.3(b).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo945l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009453.jpg": "Case T2psersGo3388?

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool). Therefore, judges should “impose sanctions on lawyers for their mode of advocacy only ’\n\nin the most egregious situations, lest lawyers be deterred from vigorous representation of\n\ntheir clients.” Id.

The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to investigate.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> where Conrad disclosed sufficient information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “investigate,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had concluded that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this conclusion was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter. Trzaskoma’s response was:\n\nTrzaskoma: We were not aware of the facts that have come to light, and I think if your\n\nHonor deems it appropriate, we can submit a leter.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009481.jpg": "Case deel leteieleaeeaiay Var, y Seana ete as\n3\nCACS3PARC\nL have that discussion.\n2 The first question obviously is was the performance\n3 deficient here.

Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v.

Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s discretion to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt. The exercise of the trial judge’s discretion to grant\nchallenges for cause on the basis of inferred bias is especially appropriate\n\nin such situations.\n\nId. at 47 (emphasis added).\n\nJust as it is “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror\nhas engaged in “activities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial,” so too\nis it “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror has been\nsubject to conduct “that closely approximate[d] [that] of the defendant on trial.” See id. In\nsuch a case, there ls just too great a risk that such a juror will not be able to decide the\ncase purely based on the applicable law and the evidence or lack of evidence, even\nthough that inability may be unconscious. This is one such case.\n\n3. Actual bias\n\n“Actual bias is “bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43\n(citing United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “A juror ls found by the judge\nto be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l5 of 49\n\nSee Warger v.

Radonjich, l F.3d ll7, l2o (2d Cir. l993).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBased on the current record, the defendant has failed to satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test. Houever, the Government consents to a limited hearing, as set forth in more\ndetail in Part II, infra.\n\nl. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the First Prong of McDonough\na. The Defendant Must Prove a Deliberate Falsehood\n\nThe defendant argues that, under the McDonough test, “[a]n intentionally false answer\nduring voir dire is not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial.” (Def. Mem. at 23). This argument\nis foreclosed by binding Second Circuit precedent, which requires “dishonesty,” i.e., a deliberate\nfalsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake. Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6. “In other words,\nthe Court must assess whether [the juror] deliberately lied or consciously deceived the Court, as\nopposed to providing inaccurate responses as a result of a mistake, misunderstanding or\nembarrassment.” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 437 (W.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (citing Shaoul,\n4l F.3d at 8l5), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l). That rule\nexists for good reason: “To invalidate the result of a three-week trial because of a juror’s mistaken,\nthough honest response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial\nsystem can be expected to give.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nIn Shaoul, the Second Circuit considered McDonough and, specifically, its holding “‘that\nto obtain a new trial in. . . a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> [where a juror makes a mistaken response to a question], a\nparty must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and impartial. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to circumstances in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009826.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 28 of 49\n\nalso decline to hold as a general mater that, where a juror has\n\nengaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant at trial, the trial\n\njudge must presume bias. Such cases are unlikely to present the\n\n“extreme situations” that call for mandatory removal.\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46; see also id. at 46 & n.ll (rejecting A//sup decision from Ninth Circuit that\ncourt must presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences were biased”). Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\ninconsistent with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that similarity of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the combination of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, similarity of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l6l, l66-68 (lst Cir. 2ol3); see also Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-\n2o (7th Cir. l992) (citing combination of factors in “extreme” case where two jurors were\nburglarized during deliberations and then changed their votes as a result, and stating that “our\nholding is limited to the very unique facts stated herein” and “[iJt is unlikely these rare\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3l of 49\ni. Inferred Bias\n\nWhile the category of cases in which bias must be implied or presumed is limited to\n“exceptional” or “extreme situations,” the district court retains discretion to dismiss a juror for\ncause when “a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to\nwarrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46-47. This doctrine of “inferred bias” is\n“closely linked” to the “traditional categories” of actual and implied bias, and a finding of inferred\nbias is permited “‘only after having received responses from the juror that permit an inference that\nthe juror in question would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Jd. at 47. “[A] finding\nof inferred bias is, by definition, within the discretion of the trial court.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\nAnd, as with actual bias, “a district court’s evaluation of the juror’s impartiality is accorded\ndeference.” /d.; see also id. (“There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined\nto disturb a trial judge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for\ncause in the empanelling of a jury.” (quoting United States v. Ploof, 464 F.2d ll6, ll8-l9 n.4 (2d\nCir. l972))).\n\nHere, the record refutes any suggestion that, had Juror 5o disclosed a history of sexual\nabuse, the Court would have struck him based on a finding of inferred bias. As set forth above,\nthe record is clear that the Court would have in fact conducted targeted follou-up questioning and,\nabsent some indication in such questioning that would have permited an inference of bias, the\nCourt would not have struck him. See Torres, l28 F.3d at 47 (finding of inferable bias “must be\ngrounded in facts developed at voir dire’).\n\nTorres, upon which the defendant exclusively relies, is not to the contrary.

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n- 3 See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d).

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool).

The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to investigate.” Memorandum at 9.

Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “investigate,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had concluded that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this conclusion was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter.

In doing so, the government conveniently ignores the argument it\nmade to the jury at trial — namely, that Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer were all victims of\nthe same criminal plan to sexually exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and Ms. Maxwell\ncarried out using the same methods throughout the entire course of the conspiracy.

But “grooming”\nand travel were not exclusive to Count Three. Carolyn testified about being progressively\nintroduced to more serious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming.

Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n5 It is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 32 of 4o\nThe Court is unpersuaded. First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be\nimplied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial. The Defendant’s\nonly in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas. See Maxwell Br. at 3o-35;\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5. In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias\n‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being\nlitigated.’” 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l64\n(D. Mass. 2oll)). But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias\nbecause that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed\nabove) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and\ncreation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrou category.\nThe circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions\nthat jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which\nmight bear directly or indirectly on the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no\nshouing of actual bias or prejudice.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Broun,\n644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d\nCir. l99l). As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ntrial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that\nwere similar to conduct charged in the case. l28 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]Juch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\na2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” Jd. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. Id.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll—l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\nquestionnaire session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive throughout trial. There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.” /d. at 4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial. Voir Dire\nTr. at l28-3l. Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l.

In addition, Carolyn was not\nso influenced by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population.

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel4of55\nwhen Annie managed to extricate herself from the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> by running to the bathroom, thereby\ndenying Epstein further sexual contact, the defendant seemed “very disinterested” in Annie. (/d.).\n\n4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts\n\nBeginning in or about the summer of 2ooo, the defendant and Epstein entered a new phase\nof their scheme to sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Maxwell recruited a l7-year-old\ngirl named Virginia Roberts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Epstein with massages.\n(PSR § 56). Over the next several months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with sexualized\nmassages at his Palm Beach residence, in exchange for hundreds of dollars in cash for each\nmassage. (PSR § 55). Virginia also traveled with Epstein and Maxwell to other locations,\nincluding New York and the Virgin Islands, on Epstein’s private plane. (PSR 457). Virginia\nbrought other teenage girls to Epstein’s Palm Beach house. (PSR 458). One of those girls was a\nl4-year-old girl named Carolyn who Virginia introduced to the defendant and Epstein at the Palm\nBeach villa in 2ool. (PSR ff 58, 59). Thus began the pyramid scheme phase of the defendant and\nEpstein’s abuse of teenage girls.\n\n5. Sexual Abuse of Carolyn\n\nCarolyn visited Epstein’s Palm Beach residence more than loo times, during each of which\nshe was sexually abused during paid sexualized massages. (PSR 59). Carolyn met the defendant\nthe very first time she went to Epstein’s house, and she interacted with the defendant multiple\ntimes thereafter. (/d.). On Carolyn’s first visit to the house, the defendant greeted Virginia, who\nintroduced Carolyn to the defendant. (PSR { 62). The defendant then told Virginia, “You can\nbring her upstairs and shou her what to do,” after which Virginia shoued Carolyn hou to perform\na sexual massage on Epstein. (PSR {| 62-63).

The interests protected by such counseling are the client’s interests in limiting\ndisclosure of information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e) and in taking\nresponsible action to deal with situations atributable to the client. If a client, whether in\nresponse to the lawyer’s counseling or otherwise, takes corrective action — such as by\nceasing the client’s oun criminal act or by dissuading a third person* from commiting or\ncontinuing a criminal act before harm is caused — the option for permissive disclosure\nby the lawyer would cease because the threat posed by the criminal act would no longer\nbe present. When the actor is a nonclient or when the act is deliberate or malicious, the\nlawyer who contemplates making adverse disclosure of protected information may\nreasonably* conclude that the compelling interests of the lawyer or others in their oun\npersonal safety preclude personal contact with the actor. Before counseling an actor\nwho is a nonclient, the lawyer should, if reasonable* under the circumstances, first\nadvise the client of the lawyer’s intended course of action.

Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 78 of 26l l239\nLC6Cmax3 Kate —- cross\n\nl A.

Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process.

Sec. Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d 625, 628 (S.D.N-Y. 2ol5). Although\nRule 6(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure generally lists the exceptions to grand\njury secrecy, the Second Circuit has recognized that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in\nwhich release of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d Cir. l997); see also Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 767 (7th\nCir. 2ol6) (“Rule 6(e)(3)(E) does not displace that inherent pouer. It merely identifies a permissive\nlist of situations where that pouer can be used.’’). One such “special circumstance” is historical\ninterest by the public. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo5. Under Jn re Craig, this Court retains discretion\nto determine “whether such an interest outweighs the countervailing interests in privacy and\nsecrecy[.]” Jd.\n\n=A Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested\nand concerned about the Epstein mater. Indeed, other jurists have released grand jury transcripts\nafter concluding that Epstein’s case qualifies as a mater of public concern. See Order Granting\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Court’s February 29, 2o24 Order, CA Florida\nHoldings, LLC v. Dave Aronberg and Joseph Abruzzo, 5o-2ol9 CA-ol468l (l5th Cir. July l,\n2o24).° After all, Jeffrey Epstein is “the most infamous pedophile in American history.” /d. The\nfacts surrounding Epstein’s case “tell a tale of national disgrace.” Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d l244, l247\n(llth Cir. 2o2l) (discussing the plea agreement secured by Epstein in Florida). The grand jury\nrecords are thus “critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history.” Jn re Petition of\nNat. Sec. Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 629. “The time for the public to guess what they contain\n3 htps://www.mypalmbeachclerk.com/home/shoupublisheddocument/4l94/6385544237lol7oooo.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 785 _ Filed o7/l8/25 Page4of4\nshould end.” /d. Notably, the privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance are\nsubstantially diminished due to Epstein’s death. Of course, as noted above, the Department of\nJustice will work with the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\nto redact all victim-identifying information prior to any release. While the Government recognizes\nthat Maxwell’s case is currently pending before the Supreme Court on a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari, it nonetheless moves this Court for relief due to the intense public scrutiny into this\nmater.\n\n6. For these reasons, this Court should conclude that the Epstein and Maxwell cases\nqualify as a mater of public interest, release the associated grand jury transcripts, and lift any\npreexisting protective orders.

Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public\ndisclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist.

So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations.

So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned.

The extent of her financial\n\nl9 resources is demonstrated by some of the transactions and bank\n2o accounts discussed in the government's submission and here\n2l today, and Ms. Maxwell has apparently failed to submit a full\n22 accounting or even a close to full accounting of her financial\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">Situation</span>.

In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her\nspouse’s leter makes clear, after spending a few months away ae Ms. Maxwell\nnoved i so that she could i be within\ndriving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. A §\nl2) (“|Ghislaine| was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against\nher, but to be within driving distance of New York.”). Contrary to the impression given by the\ngovernment, Ms. Maxwell was not “changing locations on multiple occasions” as if she were a\nfugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms. Maxwell moved into the house in New Hampshire in\nDecember 2ol9, she remained there continuously for approximately seven months until her\nairest. (See Ex. B) (“|S|he was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving\naround constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name.”).\n\nMs. Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with the government\nfrom the moment of Epstein’s arrest up the time of her oun arrest, as would be customary in\nsuch situations. Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-\nperson meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2ol9, and also\nin January and March 2o2o. The timeline atached to this submission illustrates the extent\nof these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an opportunity to be heard in the\nevent that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.\nWe were never given that opportunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern District of\nNew York, nor were we given any notice of her impending arrest.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020068.jpg": "Caseabe? o-c6o8BG+ANt DEcuMEr? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Boat 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020073.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEctiMert loo2 Filed6R238/?HgPage tl Boaf 36\nFurther, and as set forth belou, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence,\nincluding contemporary documents and other witnesses.\n\nIn challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.\nAt the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested\nheavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago. (See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020080.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGHANt BEctIMerf loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPaAge Ota 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. As set forth in\nExhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the\nextradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for\nwhich extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\nenforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nl This Opinion & Onder will be temporarily sealed in order to allou the parties to propose\nredactions to sensitive or confidential information.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020164.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef 4 Ob 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020194.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMheht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageBlGhl2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt.

This is not a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate.

Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n> Tt is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020970.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel44 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020975.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel49 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 32 of 4o\n\nThe Court is unpersuaded. First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be\nimplied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial. The Defendant’s\nonly in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas. See Maxwell Br. at 3o-35;\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5. In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias\n“when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being\nlitigated.”” 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l64\n(D. Mass. 2oll)). But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias\nbecause that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed\nabove) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and\ncreation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.\n\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrou category.\nThe circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions\nthat jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which\nmight bear directly or indirectly on the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no\nshouing of actual bias or prejudice.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Broun,\n644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d\nCir. l99l). As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ntrial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that\nwere similar to conduct charged in the case. l28 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]uch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020976.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” /d. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o976\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020977.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020981.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel55 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll-l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\nquestionnaire session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive throughout trial. There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.” Jd. at4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial.

Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l.

In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.\n\nFirst, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal\ndistrict outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and\nprinciples of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution\ncanon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto\na plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.\n\nSecond, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672. And Annabi made clear that charges\nare “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.\nId. But here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct\nfrom 2ool through 2oo4 that falls entirely within the 2ool-2oo7 offense period\ncontemplated by the NPA. Therefore, Annabi is inapplicable at least as to Count\nSix.\n\nThird, Annabi and its predecessors involved situations where there was no\n“affirmative” indication whatsoever that the plea agreement was intended to bind\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021131.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page84 of ll3\nl. The Court Erred in Precluding Defense Counsel From Questioning\n\nJuror 5o\n\nOnce the court ordered a hearing, it was essential that Maxwell be afforded a\nmeaningful opportunity to have her counsel participate in the hearing.

Thai, 29 F. 3d 785, 8o3 (2d Cir. l994). See, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9-CR-58l (William H. Pauly) (procedure folloued in\nidentical <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> acknouledged that defense counsel was in best position to\nconduct the examination of the juror).\n\nDefense counsel was not permited to cross-examine Juror 5o and many of\ntheir proposed questions were rejected by the court. For example, the court refused\ninquiry into Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process;” his therapy and\nspecifically whether he spoke with a therapist about the case during the trial; the\ndetails of his sexual abuse to assess hou similar it was to the stories of the\naccusers; his social media use to the extent it contradicted his statements in voir\ndire; and his public statements both about traumatic memories and his participation\nas a juror. A277-28l. The court should have permited Maxwell’s atorneys to\nprobe the impact that the sexual abuse had on the juror in other aspects of his life\nand assess whether his answers reflected an actual or implied bias as his voluntary\npost-verdict public comments surely did. The court’s. hypothetical questions about\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021133.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page86 of ll3\nparties were aware of such statements is due to Juror 5o’s oun conduct. In such a\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, Juror 5o does not get to use 6o6(b) as a shield.\n\nRule 6o6(b)’s exception for extraneous prejudicial information is applicable\nhere. First, had this information been disclosed, Juror 5o would have been\ndisqualified or excluded from being a member of the jury. Second, his statements\ndemonstrate that he used information, concealed during voir dire, to operate as an\nunsworm expert on the subject of traumatic memory for which he was not\nqualified.'> And, third, questioning Juror 5o about his statements to media would\nhave provided the defense with an opportunity to establish through probing\nquestions the credibility of Juror 5o’s conclusory protestations that he could be fair\nand establish a valid basis for a cause challenge. Thus, testimony on this topic was\nadmissible as an exception to 6o6(b).\n\nF. The District Court Erred in Finding that (l) Juror 5o was Not\n\nBiased and (2) Juror 5o Would Not Have Been Stricken Even if\nHe Had Answered the Questions Accurately\n\nHere, the District Court abused its discretion in unfairly limiting the hearing\nand in making clearly erroneous factual findings, namely, that Juror 5o’s hearing\nDr. Elizabeth Loftus testified that people “don’t just record events and play it\nback later like a recording device would work, like a video machine, but rather, we\nare actually constructing memories when we retrieve memories.” (Tr. at 2427).\nHouever, Juror No. 5o stated that the memories of the abuse he suffered can be\n“replayed like a video.” Lucia Osborn-Croueley, Ghislaine Maxwell Juror Breaks\nSilence To The Independent: This Verdict Is For All The Victims,’ Independent\n(Jan. 4, 2o22).\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021238.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N64 3536o38, Page66 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”©? Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome .. . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n2 Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021326.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ED 3536o38, Pagel54 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !°°\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nlS The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).!°> Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”’ In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021339.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON AGS 3536o38, Pagel67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo e¢ seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\noth Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\nams Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021401.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 397 3536o38, Page229 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA. The Case Agents and Villafaia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021430.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 356 3536o38, Page258 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 256 of 348\nan instance in which Wild “asked a question that wasn’t answered” of anyone in the USAO or of\nthe FBI case agents.\n\nEdwards contacted Villafafia by email and telephone in mid-June, stating that he had\n“information and concerns that [he] would like to share.”*** In his affidavit, Edwards alleged that\nduring multiple telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage\nthe investigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because\nthe mater “was an on-going active investigation[.]” Edwards atested that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and [in] complexity.”*”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia said that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring these interactions with Edwards, which occurred before the state court plea:\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> — Epstein was still challenging\nour ability to prosecute him federally, pressing allegations of\nprosecutorial misconduct, and trying to negotiate beter plea terms,\nwhile the agents, my supervisors, and I were all moving touards\n[filing charges] — I did not feel comfortable sharing any information\nabout the case. It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\na8 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[nJothing was provided.”\na Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, {lol (June 6, 2ol7).\n23o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l43o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021477.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3ol 3536o39, Page47 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°3\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and... result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s...\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”*** Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\nBas As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\nBA When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein.

In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84). Finally, they transi-\ntioned to sexual abuse, often through the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (Tr.3o6-l5, 3l9-28, ll83-88,\n2o84-88).2\n\nIn the later phase of the scheme, from 2ool through\n2oo4, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls\nwho recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm\nBeach residence. (Tr.l5l8-25, l543-46). Maxwell and\nEpstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in\n\n2 These techniques were the textbook methods of\nchild predators. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic\nstress and interpersonal violence, explained that chil-\ndren are most frequently sexually abused through\ngrooming and coercion in the context of a relationship.\n(Tr.7l3).

Because Congress has expressly extended the\nstatute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, Judge\nNathan correctly resolved this analysis at Landgraf\nstep one. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—\nat worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it\nshould proceed to Landgraf step two, which examines\nthe retroactive effects of the statute.\n\ni. Landgraf Step Two\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf,\n“le]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-\nplying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is unques-\ntionably proper in many situations.” 5ll U.S. at 273.\n“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely be-\ncause it is applied in a case arising from conduct ante-\ndating the statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations\nbased in prior law.” Id. at 269. Instead, the question is\nwhether the statute “would impair rights a party pos-\nsessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for\npast conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\ntransactions already completed.” Jd. at 28o. Im-\nportantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-\nstituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does\nnot make application of the rule at trial retroactive,”\nbecause parties have “diminished reliance interests in\nmaters of procedure” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-\ndure regulate secondary rather than primary con-\nduct.” Id. at 275.\n\nIn Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), this Court considered a new\nstatute of limitations that shortened the time to file\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021717.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page7o of 93\n57\n\nPouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556\n(l984). Second, the party must shou “that a correct re-\nsponse would have provided a valid basis for a chal-\nlenge for cause.” Id. To satisfy this prong, a court must\ndetermine whether, if the juror had answered truth-\nfully, it would have granted a hypothetical strike for\ncause. United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 2738, 3o4 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only\non “narrouly specified, provable and legally cognizable\nbases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir.\nl997). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause\ngenerally fall into one of three “limited” categories: ac-\ntual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. “Actual\nbias is bias in fact—the existence of a state of mind\nthat leads to an inference that the person will not act\nwith entire impartiality.” Id. Implied bias, also called\n“presumed bias,” is “bias conclusively presumed as a\nmater of law.” Id. at 45. This Court has emphasized\nthat this category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘ex-\nceptional situations,” generally meaning circum-\nstances in which jurors “are related to the parties” or\n“were victims of the alleged crime itself.” Id. at 45-46.\nFinally, “[b]ias may be inferred when a juror discloses\na fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently sig-\nnificant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to\nmake mandatory a presumption of bias.” Id. at 46-47.\n\nWhere there are concrete allegations of juror mis-\nconduct, a court may conduct a post-verdict hearing.\nSee United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). The inquiry “should be limited to only what is\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021724.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page77 of 93\n64\nJuror 5o credibly testified at the hearing that he was\nable to put aside his experience of sexual abuse and\njudge the evidence fairly. This is not the sort of “ex-\ntreme <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> that call[s] for mandatory removal.”\n(A.349 (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 46)).\n\nMore generally, it is entirely appropriate for jurors\nto “rely on their common sense and life experiences to\nadjudge guilt.” (A.352). These “very human elements\n... constitute one of the strengths of our jury system,\nand we cannot and should not excommunicate them\nfrom jury deliberations.” (A.353 (quoting United States\nex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l38, 8l8 (2d Cir.\nl97o)). On these facts, “[t]o imply or infer that Juror\n5o was biased—simply because he was himself a vic-\ntim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testi-\nmony under the penalty of perjury, establishing that\nhe could be an even-handed and impartial juror—\nwould be tantamount to concluding that an individual\nwith a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair\nand impartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law,\nnor should it be.” (A.346-47).\n\nFinally, Maxwell suggests that Judge Nathan\nabused her discretion by precluding defense counsel\nfrom questioning Juror 5o, and precluding inquiry into\nJuror 5o’s “statements to journalists.” (Br.7o). As to\nthe former, the manner in which the hearing proceeds\nis commited to a district court’s “sound discretion,”\nMoten, 582 F.2d at 666, including specifically the “ex-\ntent to which the parties may participate in question-\ning the witnesses,” lannielo, 866 F.2d at 544. Judge\nNathan reasonably decided to lead the questioning\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021764.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page22 of 35\np28. Juror 5o’s pretrial selective false answers only to questions that would have\nelicited his child sexual abuse, his post-verdict activity, and his patently false and\ncontradictory explanations in the post-verdict hearing should have disqualified him\nfor service as a juror in this case.\n\nB. Had Juror 5o Disclosed in Voir Dire his Traumatic Experience as a\nVictim of Child Sex Abuse, the Information Would Have Established a\nValid Basis for a Cause Challenge\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which\n\nsignificantly paralleled the abuse described by the Government’s four key victim\nwitnesses at trial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor;\n(ll) was abused on multiple occasions over the course of several years; and (it)\ndelayed reporting the abuse. A267-268. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused\nby two people who were friends and who each had participated in the abuse. A267.\nFurthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or sexually assaulted by someone\nhe did not knou. Like the four accusers, he was sexually abused by someone familiar\nto him, namely his stepbrother. These similarities are significant and contrast sharply\nwith other jurors who answered “Yes” to Question 48 and were not struck for cause,\nbut who disclosed incidents that were not directly analogous to the facts presented\nat trial. In this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>, where Juror 5o experienced the same traumatic childhood\nsexual abuse that the trial victims had experienced, with many of the same\nsurrounding circumstances, he was not capable of seting his experiences aside and\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l764\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021770.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page28 of 35\nD. Juror 5o’s Actual, Implied, and Inferable Bias Was Established.\n\nMaxwell does not seek a per se rule of exclusion of victims of child abuse in\nsex trafficking cases, although admitedly, it would be difficult to imagine hou such\na traumatic experience could fail to give rise to inferable bias. Certain life\nexperiences create permanent biases. Nevertheless, it is this juror in this <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>\nthat the law would properly “cautiously incapacitate” because persons in such a\n<span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> would naturally feel prejudice. In his post-verdict interviews, Juror 5o\nadmited as much when he described hou he identified with the Government\nwitnesses through the lens of his oun experience of child sexual abuse; convinced\nother jurors to credit the testimony of Government witnesses and discredit defense\nwitnesses precisely because of his unique insight about memory for child sexual\nassault; and bonded so profoundly with the Government witnesses that he felt\ncompelled to contact one after trial and to give interviews about his oun experience.\nSuffice to say, this was not an example of an impartial juror using his “life\nexperiences” in the performance of his civic duty, contrary to the Court’s view.\nA352.\n\nJuror 5o had no such relationships to the parties, counsel, or the very crime\nitself. But his omissions during voir dire presented the sort of \"extreme <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>\"\nthat would qualify for presumptive bias. Torres at 46. The average person,\nvictimized by sexual abuse, would be biased when he speaks about his healing\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l77o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021771.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page29 of 35\nprocess, his trauma and his need for therapy to “deal with the stress of the [Maxwell]\ncase. A353-354.\n\nIn determining whether a juror should be excluded on the grounds of implied\nbias, a juror’s statements in voir dire are completely irrelevant. The juror may\ndeclare that he feels no prejudice in the case. But the law cautiously incapacitates\nhim from serving on the jury because, in general, persons in a similar <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> would\nfeel prejudice. U.S. v Burr, 25 Fed Cas. 49,5o (C.C. Va. l8o7). It is called the\naverage person test. See U.S. v Haynes, 398 F2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir l968); Dennis v\nU.S. 339 U.S. l62,l76 (l95o). Juror 5o fails that test.\n\nSmith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 222 (l982) (O'Connor, J., concurring)), led\nthis Court to caution that “automatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who\nare related to the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.” /d. (quoting\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45). But this limited set of examples is not exclusive. And while\nsex abuse victims who timely disclose their victimization may not be presumed\nbiased, jurors who do not disclose their victimization, thereby depriving the court\nand counsel of vital information as to challenges for cause or peremptory challenges\ncreate the extreme <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span> warned about by Justice O’Connor and the Torres court.\nSee also Nieves.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l77l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021981.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl7 Filed l2/l9/l9 Page5ofl5 5\nJbpWnoeC\n\nl MS.

As you likely knou, the\ngovernment had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge\nBerman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the\ngovernment and defense counsel a chance to speak.\nMost importantly, defense counsel stated they were \"all for finding out the truth!\" To that end, they asked\nJudge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent\nauthority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is\nimportant. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't\nlooked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska writen by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)\nconcerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense\ncounsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a\nparticular <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also\nasked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel\nobviously didn't knou that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go\nto SHU.)\nVarious atorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the \"timing of Epstein's death is curious\" and most\nof them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they\nadmited there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.\n\nPage l235\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024365.jpg": "Re: Urgent request -- Potential leak in hospital regarding Epstein's death\nFrom\nNYM/Exec Assistant~ NYM/Exec\nTo\nAssistant~\n\nDate 2ol9/o8/lo l9:l9\n\nSubject: Re: Urgent request -- Potential leak in hospital regarding Epstein's death\n\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nDo not reply to the reporter.\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: NYM/Exec Assistant~ <NYM/ExecAssistant~@bop.gov>\nDate: 8/lo/l9 6:5l PM (GMT-o5:oo)\n(oD +o o°:> EE oop 9l>\nSubject: Fwd: Urgent request -- Potential leak in hospital regarding Epstein's death\n>>> \"NYM/Exec Assistant~\" o8/lo/2ol9 l8:5l >>>\nThank you\nLee\n>>> POOP buzzfeed.com> 8/lo/2ol9 6:o3 PM >>>\nHello,\nI'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News.

Follou-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2ol9. While conducting the lo:oo p.m.\ninstitution count thatevening/\"™ \"i\" ‘| Facilities Assistant reported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-\nmail she sent to Drs Bio | SEE fd Lieutenant\" ater that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as\n\"distraught, sad and a litle confused.\" She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was okay, and he reportedly said he\nwas. Houever, Ms. [Re |noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, \"He seems dazed and\nwithdrawn.\" She went on to say, \"So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.\" Despite the fact that Lieutenar™”™ pened the e-mail there is no evidence\nthat he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, if\nMs. Peo pas concerned about suicide risk, P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct,\ncontinuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When[\"\"\"° _|opened the e-mail the follouing Monday morning, Mr.\nEpstein was evaluated by\"°\"\"™ at approximately 9:3o a.m.\nMr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July l8, 2ol9. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals\nService (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice\nindicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the\nform, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m., Def Dr fei, [an e-\nmail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about\nthis notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate\nand procedures should have been folloued as outlined in P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when\na staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is\nplaced on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these\nconditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by Dr. Bi, [or a suicide risk assessment on\nAugust l, 2ol9, at approximately l:3o p.m.\nInstitution Response: 7. Follou Up:\nStaff have been trained that it is required that they make verbal contact with either Psychology Staff or a Lieutenant\nwhen they have concerns for an inmate’s mental health. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is\nplaced on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.\n\nAs part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the follouing: “If you are emailing about an inmate\nthat may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency <span class=\"highlight\">situation</span>.
