Intervenor has witnessed the\nsame patern of political/ judicial corruption at work in his oun case; and has nou identified the same\nconspiracy at work in this case.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\ne intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2ol2/2ol3,\nintervenor filed a whistleblouer complaint with the Washington State Auditor’s Office. The\ncomplaint was escalated to Michael Horouitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A\nCase l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration). OIG refused to investigate the\ncomplaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges\nthat Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered\nthat State of Washington concealed this information so that “Democrats” and Republicans could\nlaunder $7o billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through |\nintervenor’s atorneyz.\n\ne On l2/27/l9, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the\nFalse Claims Act, seeking $l billion in damages and qui tam bounty against “Democrats”,\nRepublicans, and his former atorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by Declaration (first 2 pages only)).\n\ne On5/l/l3, USDO! submited a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor’s claim (See EXHIBIT C Case\nl:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration), falsely stating that intervenor’s allegations\n“lack sufficient factual and legal support.”\n\ne oOn5/l3/l9, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against Bill Barr and other USDOJ atorneys\nfor conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by Declaration).\n\ne On5/l4/l9, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct.,\nafter fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case l:l9-CR-\noo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration).\n\nDAVID GOLDEN\nl5l5l NW MASON HILL RD\nNORTH PLAINS, OR 97l33\nMOTION TG INTERVENE - 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo634", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000636.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document5l_ Filed o8/27/l9 Page 4of4\n|\n|\n|\n, and the substantial Jaw. Intervenor has been denied these rights so that the conspiracy can continue\nlaundering tax money. Intervenor has already proven that USDOJ/ OIG are politically corrupt federal\n| agencies, as intervenor filed a whistleblouer complaint with WA State Auditor and OIG in 2ol2/2ol3\nbecause he was worried about structural bridge collapse. As a result of filing this complaint, intervenor\n| had his career and reputation destroyed by OIG, State of WA, and his atorneyz.
