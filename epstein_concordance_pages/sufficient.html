See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates.

Accordingly, any danger that Mr. Epstein may have once posed to the\ncommunity has long since abated. At the very least, this enormous gap in time precludes a\nfinding by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the\ncommunity’s safety.°\nThe rebutable presumption of a risk of flight is negated by the evidence that the\n\ngovernment had stated it believed it could prosecute Mr. Epstein for the very same conduct for\nwhich he was immunized, albeit in a second jurisdiction, despite the protections conferred upon\nhim under the NPA. Mr. Epstein’s continuous presence in the United States even while he had a\nresidence out of the country reinforces the point. As detailed belou, Mr. Epstein understood the\nNPA as a global resolution of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here,\nincluding conduct in New York. Indeed, the government, in a Southern District of Florida filing\n® The government vastly overreaches in painting Mr. Epstein as dangerous based on musty plea\ndiscussions. The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation. See Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v.\nUnited States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 36l-lo (prosecutor stating, “[o]n the obstruction\ncharges, many of the facts that I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of [redacted]. We will need to interview her to confirm\nthe accuracy of those facts. . . .”), Dkt. 36l-ll (prosecutor stating, “I knou that someone\nmentioned there being activity on an airplane, I just wanted to make sure that there is factual\nbasis for the plea that the agents can confirm”), Dkt. 36l-9 (prosecutor stating, “I don’t knou the\nfactual basis for the alleged [redacted] because we have no independent evidence of that’). In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000288.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l5 of l6\nIV. Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.\nEpstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his\npretrial detention.\nV. Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity.

All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000335.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 7 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 7\n2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community\n\nThe dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “guarantee”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance whatsoever. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug.\n3, 2ol5); United States v. Young, Nos. l2 Cr. 5o2, l2 Cr. 645, 2ol3 WL l2l3l3oo, at *7 (D. Utah\nAug. 27, 2ol3); United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547, 2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D.\nCal. Dec. 2o, 2olo); United States v. Bohn, 33o F. Supp. 2d 96o, 96l (W.D. Tenn. 2oo4); United\nStates v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. l39, 2ooo WL l832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2ooo); United States\nv. Botero, 6o4 F. Supp. lo28, lo35 (S.D. Fla. l985). . The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\nexpensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000338.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lo of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000340.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l2 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l2\nIV. The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here\n\nFinally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the\nappropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and\ncertainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted\nbail, refrain from fleeing so he could atempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.\nNevertheless, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn.\n\nA. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution\n\nAs an initial mater, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this\nweek, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond\nthe scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New\nYork based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious\nchallenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and\nadditional charges brought based on New York conduct.\n\nBut more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District\nof New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA\noverwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to\nthe SDFL. The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander\nAcosta, United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for\nthese offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final\nparagraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms\nof the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this\nAgreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that\narose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.”\n\nIn its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed\nas an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as\nto any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA,\nand additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil\nsetlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver\nof any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.” These provisions shou the parties\ncontemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not\ninitially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final\nsubstantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.”\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “‘a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n7 All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were an\n\nevidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3l42(e) case in\n\nwhich an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering\n\nthat which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000434.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 22 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page4of9\nHon.

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk.

The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.

The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThis leter is writen in response to Order granted on January l5, 2o2l, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center (’MDC”’) in\nBrooklyn, New York. The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001401.jpg": "Casmi2o4croo3BoAuhenDocuite h?

Even a Federal Express envelope from the government\nwas not given to Ms. Maxwell until two weeks after it was sent, containing a discovery disc that\nwas unreadable. In mid-March, she received a copy of the New York Times issued in October.\nAny claim that Ms. Maxwell deletes CorrLinks emails, which is disputed, does litle to erase the\nfact that the MDC violated its oun policy by prematurely deleting Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails.\nThat her food is not heated in a thermal oven does litle to explain why she was given a salad\ncontaining mold earlier this week.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not have an eye mask; she’s not even provided a suitable face mask.\nShe covers her eyes with a touel to shield them from glaring overhead lighting that she cannot\nturn off and from flashlights pointed into her cell every l5 minutes during the night. That Ms.\nMaxwell chooses not to respond to guards during the nightime is no indication that she is\nengaged in restful sleep; rather, it’s a respite from having to engage with them.\n\nNo amount of gloss put on Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement can erase the fact\nthat she remains in de facto solitary confinement, over-managed by multiple guards, and\nsurveilled by multiple cameras 24 hours per day. The computer equipment provided remains\ninadequate to review the millions of pages of discovery under circumstances that are not\nconducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark,\nsave, and print is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to prepare this document-laden case for trial.

This claim is absurd, of\ncourse, and was again made without any sworn statement.

Judge\nNathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”\nlacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,”\nand made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not\nprovide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).\nAccordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even\nthe most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s\nappearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her\nfinancial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to\nprovide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the\ndefense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the\nprocess was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 9o-9l).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 2o of 26\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

Nor does she provide information <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to knou whether her proposed\nco-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant’s freedom\nfor $5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant’s means. In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank”).

Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New Hampshire that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 2 of 4\nalleged victims and witnesses substantially in advance of trial. But that alone does not justify\nsuch relief at this very early stage. Follouing the close of discovery, the parties should meet and\nconfer on an appropriate schedule in light of all relevant factors.

As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation.

The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F.

Nathan\n\nOctober l4, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\nsensitive information about them. (/d.). The government further asserts that such disclosure will\n“Seopardize the government’s ongoing investigation” because it will reveal to the defendant the\nscope of the government’s investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward\nto provide evidence. (/d. at l,3). Essentially, the government is arguing that disclosure of the\nMaterials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell knou, at this stage of the\nproceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might\nnot come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThese are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing\ninvestigation and establish good cause for delaying disclosure. Courts typically allou delayed\ndisclosure on these grounds when immediate disclosure may alert other potential targets of the\ninvestigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively\ncooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases\ncited in the government’s oun leter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 53l-32\n(disclosure of certain discovery materials might “alert the targets of the investigation and could\nlead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations”); United States v. Mennino, 48o F.\nSupp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (government’s ongoing investigation into other potential\ndefendants could be disrupted by disclosure of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts\noften grant protective orders in this context when the government has made a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> shouing\nthat disclosure may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (collecting cases).\n\nThe government has done neither here. The government has not made any shouing that\ndisclosure would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize\nthe safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-\nserving concern that disclosure of the Materials it might make it more difficult to recruit additional\nwitnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of “clearly defined,\nspecific and serious injury” that establishes good cause to delay disclosure under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government’s requested relief under\nRule l6(d)(l) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the\nprior statements of these witnesses to the defense.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nChristian R.

(Def. Ltr. l, 4). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule\nl6 only insofar as “it could be used to counter the government’s case or bolster a defense.” United\nStates v. Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d Cir. l993). Thus, materials that are wholly irrelevant\nto the Government’s case or the charges in the Indictment do not fall under Rule l6. That is the\ncase here. Contrary to the defense’s claim, the Government has not charged Maxwell with being\nJeffrey Epstein’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def. Ltr. 3). Instead, the\ndefendant is charged with helping Epstein identify, groom, and sexually abuse multiple minor\nvictims between l994 and l997. The Indictment does not allege that the defendant engaged in\nsuch conduct after l997. As such, the Materials are simply not relevant to the charges in the\nIndictment, much less exculpatory to the defendant.\n\nMaxwell’s argument is equally flawed with respect to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).\nThe Indictment alleges that the Government’s evidence on Counts One through Four based on her\nconduct from l994 to l997 is also evidence of the falsity of the answers provided in the deposition.\nSpecifically, the portions of her deposition that the Government alleges in the Indictment are false\nare all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period l994 through l997. Indeed, paragraph eight of the\nIndictment notes that the defendant’s statements during her deposition contradicted “some of the\nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period from l994 through l997. (Indictment, Docket No. l7, at\nlo). Consistent with that position, Counts Five and Six both incorporate by reference paragraphs\none through eight of the Indictment. (See id. at l5-l6). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant\ndid or did not participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at different times or on different\noccasions not charged in the Indictment would not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate\nthe defendant on those counts.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more importantly, the Government is not suggesting that these\nMaterials should be kept from the defense indefinitely. Rather, the Government requests\nauthorization to provide these Materials eight weeks prior to trial, along with its production of\nstatements of other non-testifying witnesses. Even assuming arguendo that the Materials\nconstitute Brady or Rule l6 evidence—which they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—\nthe defendant cites no case law for the proposition that she is entitled to their production nou,\nrather than eight weeks in advance of trial. The Second Circuit has held that “as a general rule,\nBrady and its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment\nmaterial upon request by a defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l46 (2d Cir. 2ool).\nInstead, “the Government ‘suppresses’ evidence within the meaning of Brady only if it fails to\ndisclose Brady and Giglio material in time for its effective use at trial or at a plea proceeding.” Jd.\nWhat constitutes <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time for “effective use at trial” depends on the “materiality of that\nevidence” and “the particular circumstances of the case.” Id.\n\nHere, the defendant has made no shouing as to why eight weeks in advance of trial would\nnot be enough time to make “effective use” of the Materials at trial or hou she would otherwise\nbe prejudiced by the Government’s proposed disclosure timeline. Coppa, 267 F.3d at l46.

United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974) (“[A]n indictment is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> if it,\nfirst, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge\nagainst which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquital or conviction in bar\nof future prosecutions for the same offense.”); Fed.R.Crim.P.7(c). An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings. None of these women implicated Ms.\nMaxwell in any wrongdoing, nor was Ms. Maxwell accused or involved in the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 5 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 5\ncame from another state, agents, or lawyers. In addition, the Government has disclosed the\nexistence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from\nthe United States Atorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States\nAtomey’s Georgia office.\n\nIt is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand\nthe Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant disclosure in\nthis case.” On the other hand, the Government’s leter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why\nthe Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the discovery. The\nauthority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case\ndoes not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp.\n3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO),\n2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,\n4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“NYSE”).\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this\nargument will be held on another day. It is troubling, houever, that instead of simply providing\nthe information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.\nMs. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery Plan is Inadequate and\nPrejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to a trial more than one year\nfrom her detention. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with\nfull discovery no later than November 9, 2o2o. See ECF #25, “Completion of Discovery to\ninclude electronic materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2o2o.” This representation nou\nseems incorrect. The Government, in its leter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why\nthe completion of discovery will likely not occur by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nMs. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2o2l, outside the time limits established by\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l6l, thought that she would be provided with meaningful discovery with <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\ntime to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its leter to the Court the Government\nproposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important\nwitnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old\nclaims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material\nwitnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New\nYork. Securing out-of-country testimony is difficult even where a defendant has been provided\nwith the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and\nconferred about the timing of disclosure of witness statements, so it is premature to discuss these\nissues with the Court. We note, houever, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it\nwill be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nThe Government’s suggested timeline also impairs Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively\naddress significant legal issues including motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law.

The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool82o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62 Filed ll/o8/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein.

This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make.

Counts\nFive and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F.

The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”.

The Act applies in the three\njurisdictions within the United Kingdom: (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; and (c) Northern Ireland.

He has acted as an expert consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on\ninternational co-operation and has advised overseas governments on the drafting and\nimplementation of their domestic legislation.\n\n3. Independent review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements\n\n3.l. In 2oll/l2, together with Lord Justice Scot Baker and Anand Doobay, Mr Perry was\nappointed by the UK Government to conduct the Home Office’s Independent Review of\nthe UK’s extradition arrangements. The review formed the basis of changes to the\nExtradition Act 2oo3.\n\n3.2. The year-long review looked in detail at the follouing five areas:\n® the Home Secretary’s discretionary pouers to stop extradition.\n\ne the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, which deals with extradition\nrequests between European countries.\n\ne where a crime is mainly commited in the UK, whether the person should be tried\nin the UK.\n\ne whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced.\n\ne whether requesting countries should be required to provide <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence to\nprove an allegation.\n\n3.3. The report, totalling 488 pages and presented to the Home Secretary on 3o September\n2oll, made a series of recommendations in respect of the UK’s extradition arrangements.\nPart 7 of the report looked specifically at extradition arrangements between the United\nStates and United Kingdom under the 2oo3 UK-US Treaty on Extradition. It assessed the\neffectiveness of the tests used in each jurisdiction and laid out the authors’ observations\non the procedures under the treaty. Their conclusion was that the 2oo3 treaty was\noperating fairly and there was no basis to seek its renegotiation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ll4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 29 of 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773 (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same). Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 32 of 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document ll7 Filed ol/25/2l Page 2 of 3\nl MEN\nNe oN N U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\\ Bee |e N Federal Bureau of Prisons\nSs ae Sg) Hy Metropolitan Detention Center\n8o 29h Street\nBrooklyn, New York ll232\nJanuary 25, 2o2l\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to Order granted on January l5, 2o2l, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center (’MDC’) in\nBrooklyn, New York. The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\n\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\n\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l2o Filed ol/25/2l Page 7 of l9\n\nB. Counts Five and Six (the “Perjury Counts”)\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell commited perjury in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § l623 by testifying falsely at two separate civil depositions—one on\nApril 22, 2ol6 (Count Five) and the other on July 22, 2ol6 (Count Six). /d. 9 2l, 23.\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nA. Joinder of Offenses\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part,\n(a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may charge a\ndefendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses\ncharged--whether felonies or misdemeanors or both--are of the same or\nsimilar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\nconnected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\n\nRule 8(a) sets forth three different circumstances in which separate offenses may be\nproperly joined in the same indictment; namely, when the offenses: (l) “are of the same or\nsimilar character,” (2) “are based on the same act or transaction,” or (3) “are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging\nseparate offenses in the same indictment and allouing them to be tried together “inevitably\ninvolves some danger of prejudice” to the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses in\ncircumstances where “gains in trial efficiency outweigh the recognized prejudice that accrues to\nthe accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37, lo42-43 (2d Cir.l988); see also United\nStates v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir. l98o) (purpose of Rule 8 is to promote “trial\nconvenience and economy of judicial and prosecutorial resources”); United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43o (2d Cir. l978) (“efficiency and economy” are the “customary justifications for\njoinder”).\n\nIn conducting a Rule 8(a) analysis, “no one characteristic is always <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to establish\n‘similarity’ of offenses ... and each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page lo of l9\n\nPrejudice <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to justify severance under Rule l4 may exist when: (l) the defendant\nmight become embarrassed or confounded in presenting separate defenses, (2) the jury might use\nevidence of one of the crimes charged to infer a criminal disposition to commit the other crime\nor crimes charged, or (3) the jury might cumulate evidence of the various crimes charged to find\nguilt on a count, which if considered separately, it would not so find. Halper, 59o F.2d at 44o\n(citing Drew v. United States, 33l F.2d 85, 88 (D.C. Cir. l964)); United States v. Chevalier, 776\nF. Supp. 853, 857 (D. Vt. l99l) (citing United States v.

Ramos, 2oo9 WL l6l99l2, at *l; Burke, 789 F. Supp. 2d at\n398.\n\nANALYSIS\nA. The Perjury Counts Are Improperly Joined Under Rule 8(a) and Must Be\nSevered\n\nThe Perjury Counts (Counts Five and Six) were improperly joined and should be severed\nfrom the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) as a mater of law. The Perjury Counts\nand the Mann Act Counts are entirely separate offenses that involve different time periods,\ndifferent alleged victims, and different substantive charges. The Mann Act Counts are confined,\npurposefully, to a very narrou time period and allege that Ms. Maxwell enticed and transported\nminors to engage in illegal sexual activity from l994 to l997. Indictment J 9, l3, l5, l9. The\nPerjury Counts allege that Ms. Maxwell purportedly made false statements in 2ol6 in a civil\ndefamation action that concerned allegations of purported sexual abuse in a later time period\n(l999-2oo2) for which Ms. Maxwell has never been charged criminally. /d. §f[ 2l, 23; Ex. A at\n3-5. The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, is not one of the three\naccusers referred to in the Mann Act Counts. Similarly, the people we believe to be the three\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2288\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l2 of l9\nsubstantive crimes when the false declarations “concern the substantive offenses.” Potamitis,\n739 F.2d at 79l. Such cases typically involve situations where the defendant was aware that he\nwas being investigated and either lied to the grand jury or made false statements to law\nenforcement officers in an effort to thwart the existing investigation into the other offenses with\nwhich he was charged. See, e.g., id. at 789-9o (joinder of perjury, false statements, and\nobstruction of justice counts proper where defendant made false statements to FBI agents and\nperjured himself in the grand jury); see also id. at 79l (collecting cases).\n\nHere, the circumstances are very different and joinder is not appropriate. The\ngovernment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell lied to the grand jury or the FBI to derail its\ninvestigation into the conduct underlying the Mann Act Counts. Instead, it alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements in two depositions in an unrelated civil defamation action which\noccurred in April and July 2ol6. Moreover, although the government alleges that some of the\nquestions posed at the depositions related to some of the alleged victims in this case (Indictment\n{| 2, 8), the questions were tangential to the defamation action, which was based on Ms.\nMaxwell’s denial of a purported conspiracy with Epstein from l999-2oo2 involving Ms. Giuffre.\nThe alleged false statements underlying the Perjury Counts therefore do not “concern” the Mann\nAct Counts and cannot be joined as part of a “common scheme or plan.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at\n79l.\n\nThe government makes only a half-hearted, and ineffective, atempt to allege a\nconnection between the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy Rule 8(a).\nParagraph 2 of the Indictment alleges:\n\n[I]n an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned\n\nabout her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described\n\nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2ol6.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo229o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 4 of 8\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) in this case is remarkable because it fails to\nidentify an accuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or\nwhen anything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)). An indictment that fails to allege the essential elements of the crime\ncharged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See Russell v. United States, 369 U.S.\n749, 76o-6l (l962).\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo23l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 5of8\n\nIn many cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is lou. It is also true that courts\nfind, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in connection with the mater may cure various\npleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v. Jain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (“When supplemented by discovery material, no additional\ninformation is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise.”). Houever, “while an\nindictment parroting the language of a federal criminal statute is often <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>, there are crimes\nthat must be charged with greater specificity.” United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2 at\nlo9.\n\nThese are those crimes.\n\nHere, neither the Indictment nor the discovery inform Ms. Maxwell about critical\ninformation necessary to prepare her defense. The Indictment contains multiple open-ended time\nperiods:\n\ne “from at least in or about l994, up to and including at least in or about l997”\n49 l,9, l3, l5; and\ne “beginning in at least l994” q 4.\n\nThese phrases make the time frame alleged limitless and meaningless for application of\nthe statute of limitations or any defense.\n\nIn addition to not identifying the individuals accusing Ms. Maxwell of a crime, the\nIndictment, through the use of inconsistent and vague phrases, makes it impossible to knou who\nmay, or may not, be someone that the Government claims is a “victim.”\n\ne “minor girls” ¥ l;\ne “victims” ¥ l;\ne “victims were as young as l4” § l;\ne “certain girls were in fact under the age of l8” § l;\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo23l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 6 of l3\nSouthern District of New York (“Jury Plan”), available at\nhtps://nysd.uscourts. gov/sites/default/files/pdf/juryplan_ feb _2oo9.pdf.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery.

The capricious\nquestioning about 26-year-old claims presents the same practical problems for the defense,\nevidence that would exculpate Ms. Maxwell has been lost or destroyed.\n\nThis Indictment should be dismissed because Counts One through Four are time barred\nand the 26-year delay in bringing the charges violates Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment right to\ndue process. Counts Five and Six should be dismissed for the variety of reasons as catalogued in\nother pleadings and the four-year prejudicial preindictment delay also violates due process.\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires dismissal of an indictment for\ndelay which results in a violation of the fundamental concepts of justice or the community's\nsense of fair play and decency. To determine whether a due process violation has occurred, the\ngovernment’s reasons for the delay must be weighed against the prejudicial effects of the delay\non the defendant. United States v.

Despite repeated requests, the government refuses to produce any\nevidence. Without knouing the who, what, when, and why of these allegations, the task of\nidentifying dead and missing witnesses, percipient witness, travel records, phone records, or\ntemporally relevant documents is challenging and limited by the vagueness of the claims.

Ms. Maxwell\nhas no ability to conclusively identify these individuals much less interview them and therefore\ncannot represent to the Court whether they are alive, remember anything, or have useful\nevidence. By withholding this information, the government is purposefully preventing Ms.\nMaxwell from fully litigating this issue and presenting a defense.\n\nWhat we knou, so far, houever, will be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to establish prejudice. Potential\ndefense witnesses are dead, missing, otherwise unavailable, or unable to recall key events\nclearly. In contrast, the government will profit from the dimmed memories of witnesses with:\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 38\nUnited States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985). Annabi supports dismissal here by\nconfirming that where, as here, both the text of the NPA and the facts and circumstances of the\nunderlying negotiations demonstrate an intent to bind the United States (other USAQs), they are\nso bound. Alternatively, any application of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL\nwould conflict with the likely interpretation of the NPA by the Eleventh Circuit, which should\napply in case of any such conflict.\n\nThird, the government argues that the co-conspirator immunity provision prohibits only\nprosecutions for (i) conduct between 2ool and 2oo7 and (i) statutory offenses specifically\nreferenced in the factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision\ncontains no such limitations and thus forecloses this argument. The text is clear, but even if it\nwere ambiguous, it must be strictly construed against the government.\n\nIn the alternative, to the extent there is any doubt that the NPA bars this prosecution, the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the NPA at least raise <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> issues regarding the parties’\nintent to warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Accordingly, if the\nindictment is not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell requests leave to conduct discovery as to the intent of\nthe parties to the NPA with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, as well as an\nevidentiary hearing in aid of this Motion.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nOn or about September 24, 2oo7, Epstein and his counsel entered into the NPA with\nAcosta, the United States Atorney for the SDFL.* While USAOs in a number of judicial\ndistricts, including this District, typically use a standard template for plea agreements and other\nnon-prosecution agreements, this NPA did not follou such a standard format. To the contrary,\n\n* A copy of the NPA is atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 33 of 38\ncourts/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-epstein-aide/2495762/). And the government has\nacknouledged, by omission, that one of the three alleged victims referenced in the current\nindictment was interviewed by the USAO for the SDFL. See Reply Mem. at 6 (“two of the\nvictims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL’”).\n\nAs noted above, Epstein and his counsel sought to prevent prosecution against his\nputative co-conspirators to the maximum extent possible. Had the government intended to limit\nthat protection to a specific time period or to violations of specific statutes, it could have done so.\nIt did not. Thus, by charging Ms. Maxwell with conduct in which she allegedly engaged as part\nof a conspiracy with Epstein—conduct that predates the NPA—the government has violated the\nNPA.\n\na\n\nIn sum, none of the three arguments proffered by the government regarding the\napplicability of the NPA is meritorious. Ms. Maxwell is a third-party beneficiary of the NPA\nwith standing to enforce the co-conspirator immunity provision. The co-conspirator immunity\nprovision binds all USAQOs and is not limited to the SDFL. It imposes no limitation on the scope\nof covered conduct—and even if it did, the conduct alleged here would be covered. At most, the\nco-conspirator immunity provision is ambiguous, and thus must be construed against the\ngovernment. Because the co-conspirator immunity provision bars the government’s prosecution\nof Ms. Maxwell on charges arising out of her alleged conspiracy with Epstein, the indictment\nshould be dismissed.\n\nI. In the Alternative, the Court Should Permit Discovery and Conduct an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nThe language of the NPA and the facts submited herewith are more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for\nthe Court to find that the NPA bars the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, particularly when any\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 35 of 38\ncontract arising out of commercial negotiations among private parties, we believe the court did\nnot correctly apply the standards that govern the interpretation of plea agreements with the\ngovernment. We have long recognized that plea agreements are significantly different from\ncommercial contracts.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (emphasis added). The court explained:\n\nGovernment conduct in negotiating plea agreements must comport with the\n\nhighest standard of fairness. Because such agreements involve waivers of\n\nfundamental constitutional rights, prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\n\nperformance.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omited). The court held that given the absence of\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing, “the record does not furnish a basis for a complete\nunderstanding of what happened in the course of the plea negotiations,” and that the defendant’s\nevidence was “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> in these circumstances” to require the district court to take such action.\nTd. at l9o.\n\nUnlike the agreement in Fe/dman, the NPA here contains no integration clause, and the\nco-conspirator immunity provision, on its face, bars prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators without limitation as to judicial district, time period of the underlying conduct, or\nthe statutory violations alleged. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Feldman, Ms. Maxwell had\nno role in the negotiation of the NPA, and thus a// of the information relevant to its construction\nis in the possession of third parties. Houever, we understand that Epstein sought the maximum\nprotection from prosecution possible for his potential co-conspirators and that Main Justice\nparticipated in the negotiation of the NPA, and there is evidence that the USAO-SDFL consulted\nwith the USAO for this District in its investigation. SDFL Privilege Log at 4, 5, 7. This\ninformation could be confirmed through discovery.\n\nMedia reports regarding the November 2o2o OPR report further support Ms. Maxwell’s\nposition.

Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision.

For the very same reasons, the Jencks Act and\n4o4(b) evidence should be produced to the defense no later than March l2, 2o2l.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should grant Ms. Maxwell’s request for a bill\nof particulars and her other requests for pretrial disclosures.\nI. Motion for a Bill of Particulars\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court direct the government to file a Bill of Particulars,\npursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, because the Superseding\nIndictment does not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Counts One\nthrough Four of the indictment make vague and unspecified allegations that Ms. Maxwell\npurportedly enticed and caused unidentified individuals to travel to engage in illegal sex acts\nover a four-year period. But they provide no specifics about when these events supposedly took\nplace or what constituted the alleged illegal sex acts. Indeed, it is nou almost seven months\nsince Ms. Maxwell was arrested and the government s/i// has not even disclosed the identities of\nthe three accusers that form the core of the government’s case against her in Counts One through\nFour. Nor has the government alleged why Ms. Maxwell’s supposedly perjurious responses to\nthe deposition questions set forth in Counts Five and Six were material to the defamation\nproceeding in which they arose. Ms. Maxwell cannot hope to investigate these allegations and\nadequately prepare for trial with such limited information. A bill of particulars is therefore\nwarranted.\n\nRule 7(f) permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> particularity the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant\nto prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574\n(2d Cir. l987).

It is further requested that the Court direct the\ngovernment to disclose such information immediately upon its discovery.\n\nIt is well setled that pursuant to Brady and its progeny, the government must\ndisclose evidence, information, and facts that could be used to impeach its witnesses. See\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 225 (2d Cir. 2oo7). Such evidence includes any\nand all evidence of a witness’ prior crimes or acts of moral turpitude, prior inconsistent\nstatements, and statements demonstrating a lack of knouledge or a denial of the facts of the\ncase or the alleged guilt of the defendant, and specific instances of conduct from which it\ncan be inferred the witness is untruthful.\n\nBut disclosure of Brady material is not the end of the line. Quite the contrary, it is a\nlaunching point for an investigation that may bear critical information. In order to mount an\neffective defense, Ms. Maxwell must receive this material in <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to investigate\nand develop it for effective use before and during trial. We therefore request the immediate\ndisclosure of all Brady and Giglio material.\n\nThe government takes the customary position that it will turn over any Gig/io material at\nthe time it provides prior statements of witnesses pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. In doing so, the\ngovernment erroneously assumes that Gig/io material is something other than Brady material.\nThe Supreme Court has made clear that impeachment evidence “falls within the Brady rule.”\nBagley, 473 U.S. at 676 (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54).

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.

The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec.

The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence.

The Manhatan master |\nwheel randomly draws names from New York, Bronx, Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland, :\nwhile the White Plains master wheel draws names from Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,\nSullivan and Dutchess. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *l. Because Westchester, Putnam, and :\nRockland counties are included in both master wheels, the Jury Plan instructs that the names\nfrom these counties be “apportioned among the two master wheels to ‘reasonably reflect the\nrelative number of registered voters of each county.’” See id.\n“Periodically, names are drawn from the master wheels ‘in an amount <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to meet |\nthe anticipated demands for jurors for the next six months.” Jd.

The burden is so heavy that it is rarely met by a defendant.\nSee DeMichele v. Greenburgh Centr. Sch. Dist.

See\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5-o6 (2d Cir. l982) (a defendant’s “proof of prejudice\nmust be definite and not speculative”); see also United States v. Henderson, 337 F.3d 9l4, 92o\n(7th Cir. 2oo3) (prejudice <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to warrant dismissal for pre-indictment delay must be “actual\nand substantial” and “specific, concrete, and supported by evidence”). Prejudice in this context\nrefers to “actual prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” United States v. Elsbery, 6o2\nF.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979). The mere loss of witnesses or evidence, without more, is\ninsufficient. Claims of loss of memory resulting from the passage of time have been held to be\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal of an indictment on due process grounds. See United States v.\nWright, 343 F.3d 849, 86o (6th Cir. 2oo3); Henderson, 337 F.3d at 9l9-2o. Moreover, even when\na claim of prejudice is based upon the complete loss of a witness’s testimony or other evidence, a\ndefendant nevertheless must shou hou that testimony or evidence would have affected the\noutcome or otherwise have assisted the case. See United States v. Gilbert, 266 F.3d ll8o, ll87\n(9th Cir. 2ool) (defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim rejected due to failure to shou “hou the\ntestimony from [three absent] witnesses would have benefited his case”); United States v.

In sum, the defendant has not put “specific\nevidence” before this Court demonstrating that the loss of Detective Recarey’s testimony, even if\nadmissible, has caused her actual prejudice. Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d at 4oo.\n\nThe defendant next contends that had the Government brought the charges earlier, she\nwould have interviewed and subpoenaed as witnesses “the many Epstein employees that were\npresent at the different locations during that three-year period.” (Def. Mot. 7 at ll). She does not\nspecify which employees she would have called as witnesses, the grounds for contending they are\n“lost” or “missing,” whether they would have been willing to testify, or what admissible evidence\nthey would have provided. She merely speculates that the evidence could have helped her defense.\nThis is far from the definite proof of prejudice required to state a due process claim. See United\nStates v. Greer, 956 F. Supp. 525, 528 (D. Vt. l997) (“In the context of unavailable witnesses, the\ndefendant must offer some grounds for his belief that the absent witness would have helped his\ncase in a material way.” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)).\n\nThe defendant also argues that “[m]any potential witnesses have been contacted in relation\nto this mater and other related litigations,” noting that “[s]ignificant numbers of potential\nwitnesses no longer remember when events may have occurred” or “who was present.” (Def. Mot.\n7 at l2). Dimming or fading memories over the passage of time are not in themselves <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto “demonstrate that [defendants] cannot receive a fair trial” or “justify the dismissal of the\nindictment.” Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 326; Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d at lo59. Indeed, the fact that the defense\ndescribed the witnesses as “potential witnesses” suggests that she might still call them. Further,\n’ The third victim, Minor Victim-2, was interviewed previously by the FBI.

Lovasco, 43l\nU.S. at 79o. The defendant’s motion fails because she has not demonstrated the other necessary\nelement to prevail: that the claimed delay by the Government was intentional and deliberate to\ngain a strategic advantage. Here, as in Lovasco, any pre-indictment delay was the result of the\nGovernment’s continuing investigation of the case. The Lovasco Court held that the investigative\ndelay did not deprive the defendant of his due process rights and noted that imposing a duty upon\nprosecutors to file charges as soon as probable cause exists “‘would have a deleterious effect both\nupon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself.’” Jd. at 79l (quoting\nUnited States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. ll6, l2o (l966)).\n\nThe same is true in the present case. The defendant has not shoun—and cannot shou—\nthat the Government caused any pre-indictment delay in this case to gain a tactical advantage. The\ndefendant argues that “[t]actical, reckless, and bad faith motives can reasonably be inferred from\nthe way the government has ignored evidence, delayed any prosecution, enlisted partisan lawyers\nto do its bidding, circumvented established precedent to illegally obtain evidence, and\nmisleadingly quoting banal testimony so that it could be labeled ‘perjury.’” (Def. Mot. 7 at l5).\nBut rhetoric aside, the defendant offers nothing beyond baseless speculation in support of her\nclaims.\n\nThe defendant claims a twenty-six-year delay on the part of the Government in bringing\nCounts One through Four and a four-year delay as to Counts Five and Six. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4).\nThat is not so. The USAO-SDNY opened its investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators in\nlate November 2ol8. See Section IV, infra. Epstein was charged by indictment on July 2, 2ol9.\nThereafter, the Government continued its investigation, which included interviewing two victims\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003019.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 85 of 239\nparticular, this mater appears to be the only remaining active civil case in this District in which\nclaims against Ghislaine Maxwell have been asserted.” (2o Civ. 484 (DCF) (JGK), Dkt. No. 8o\nat 2). The defendant’s baseless conjecture about the Government’s supposedly nefarious reasons\nfor delaying her prosecution are not <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to support a dismissal of the Indictment. The\ndefendant ignores the fact that cases such as this one take time to investigate and indict.\n\nThe defendant also suggests that the Government engaged in reckless disregard of\ncircumstances that would likely impede her ability to mount an effective defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at\n5-6, l5). As an initial mater, this argument falls short of “a standard that requires a shouing of\nintentionality.” United States v. Wey, No. l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *l3 n.8\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l8, 2ol7).24_ While this Court in Wey did not foreclose the possibility of\nrecklessness sufficing under certain circumstances, much as in Wey, “the instant case does not\nrequire this Court to pass on the issue,” id., because there is no evidence of recklessness in this\ncase. To the contrary, as detailed above, the Government acted promptly in bringing criminal\ncharges shortly after two key victims whose testimony helped give rise to those charges first agreed\nto speak with law enforcement. Baseless speculation aside, the defendant offers no argument or\nevidence as to hou or why the Government acted recklessly here.\n\nIn sum, not only does the defendant fail to demonstrate actual, non-speculative prejudice\nouing to pre-indictment delay, but she also fails to establish that the Government intentionally\n4 This Court has noted “some disagreement among the district courts in this Circuit as to whether\nreckless—as opposed to intentional—disregard of circumstances . . . may support a due process\nchallenge based on pre-indictment delay,” but concluded that “the pertinent decisions [], on\nbalance, more plainly comport with a standard that requires a shouing of intentionality.” Wey,\n2ol7 WL 23765l, at *l3 n.8 (citing Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (defendant bears burden of shouing\nthat “delay was a course intentionally pursued by the government for an improper purpose”)\n(emphasis added)); see also United States v.

Chief Judge McMahon subsequently inquired\nabout the Government’s application in two transcribed ex parte and sealed hearings. (Def. Mot.\n3, Exs. D & E). At the first hearing, on March 26, 2ol9, Chief Judge McMahon inquired as to\nwhy Boies Schiller did not make an application for permission to be relieved from the protective\norder, to which the Government replied that it could not “speak to why Boies Schiller in particular\ndidn’t make their oun application.” (Def.

Applicable Law\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ... .” The Due Process Clause\n“protects individuals against two types of government action.” Martinez v. McAleenan, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 349, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Procedural due process “ensures that government cannot\nunfairly and without meaningful process deprive a person of life, liberty, or property,” while\nsubstantive due process “prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the\nconscience, or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Jd. (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited; alteration omited).\n\nProcedural due process analysis focuses on whether “government action depriving a person\nof life, liberty, or property. . . [is] implemented in a fair manner,” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 746 (l987). “Courts examine procedural due process questions in two steps: the first\nasks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the\n[Government]; the second examines whether the procedures atendant upon that deprivation were\nconstitutionally <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>.” United States v. Arzberger, 592 F.

Glucksberg, 52l U.S. 7o2, 72o\n(l997) (internal quotation marks and citation omited). Because of this reluctance, the Supreme\nCourt held in Graham vy.

Pate, 386 U.S. l, 6-7 (l967)). The\nSecond Circuit further noted that reversal of a criminal conviction is a “drastic remedy that courts\nare generally reluctant to implement,” and that the court would only do so “when a prosecutor’s\ntactics cause substantial prejudice to the defendant and thereby serve to deprive him of his right to\na fair trial.” Jd.\n\nThe instant case is easily distinguishable from Valentine, as it does not involve any of the\nsame facts, including any alleged mischaracterization of grand jury testimony at trial or any\nprosecutor making “knouing use of false evidence.” Jd. at 57o-7l; see also Mills v. Scully, 826\nF.2d ll92, ll95 (2d Cir. l987) (citing Valentine for the proposition that “[e]ven where defense\ncounsel is aware of the falsity, there may be a deprivation of due process if the prosecutor\nreinforces the deception by capitalizing on it in closing argument, or by posing misleading\nquestions to the witnesses” (citations omited)). “Prosecutorial misconduct denies a defendant due\nprocess only when it is ‘of <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> significance to result in the denial of the defendant’s right to\na fair trial.’” Blisset v.

As such, the exacting standard of Franks should\napply. On this record, the defendant has not made a threshold shouing that the Government acted\nwith the intent to mislead or in reckless disregard for the truth.

Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (quotation\nmarks omited).

Supp. 2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThe Government expects to prove at trial that the defendant’s deposition statements were\nknouingly false. The defendant’s strained efforts to inject ambiguity into the questioning and to\njustify her answers as truthful are in significant part, arguments that are properly put to the jury\nand not a basis to dismiss the counts pretrial and without the benefit of a complete record. See\nUnited States v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc., 237 F.

The issue\nbefore the Court is whether the questions were so fundamentally ambiguous that a jury, after\nhearing the trial evidence, could not conclude that the “response given was false as the defendant\nunderstood the question.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). The\ndefendant has failed to establish such a fundamental defect.”\n\n3. Materiality\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that none of these answers was material to the defamation\naction. Asa threshold issue, houever, materiality is also not appropriate for resolution on a motion\nto dismiss the indictment. As noted above, materiality is a jury question “except in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o F.Supp.2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l (l997), “there is no\ndoubt that materiality is an element of perjury under § l623,” and its precedent “therefore dictates\nthat materiality be decided by the jury, not the court.” /d. at 465.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that it is inappropriate for courts to resolve questions\nrelating to the sufficiency of the evidence on a motion to dismiss the indictment. The Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure contain no “analogue for summary judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56” for several reasons. United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). First, “[p]ermiting civil ‘summary judgment’-like motions . . . would enable an end-run\naround the calibrated framework for discovery in criminal cases,” and thereby “upset the policy\n° Even if the Court concludes that any of the individual statements charged in the Indictment\ncannot sustain a perjury conviction, the count survives so long as some statement can properly be\npresented to the jury. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“It is customary, and ordinarily not\nimproper, to include more than one allegedly false statement in a single count. ... Where there\nare several such specifications of falsity in a single count, proof of any of the specifications is\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to support a verdict of guilty.” (citations omited)).\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003100.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 239\nF.2d at 929). Offenses may be joined “where the same evidence may be used to prove each count\nor if the counts have a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> logical connection.” United States v. Page, 657 F.3d l26, l29\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (internal quotation marks and citations omited). “For purposes of analysis under\nRule 8(a),” houever, “no one characteristic is always <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to establish ‘similarity’ of offenses,\nand each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v. Blakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d\nCir. l99l) (internal quotations and citations omited). For instance, in United States v. Werner,\n62o F.2d 922 (2d Cir. l98o), the “Second Circuit found <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> similarity between two cargo\nthefts that occurred two years apart and only one of which was violent in nature,” because “both\noffenses arose out of [defendant’s] scheme to use his position as an insider . . . to obtain money or\nproperty carried by it.’” United States v.

App’x 636, 638 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (first alteration in original)\n(quoting Werner, 62o F2d at 927).\n\nJoinder is also proper for “distinct criminal acts where they originated from a common\nscheme.” United States v. Ying Lin, No. l5 Cr. 6ol (DLI), 2ol8 WL 5ll3l39, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. l9, 2ol8) (citing Werner, 62o F.2d at 927). Specifically in the context of perjury, “[t]he law\nin this circuit clearly supports the joinder of underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts\nwhere, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.” United States v. Potamitis,\n739 F.2d 784, 79l (2d Cir. l984); see United States v. Sweig, 44l F.2d ll4, ll8 (2d Cir. l97l).\nFalse statements can “concern” or be connected with substantive offenses even if they were not\nmade as part of an investigation into the specific substantive conduct. See United States v. Ruiz,\n894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir. l99o) (joining false statements on loan applications with perjury about\n“atempts to secure Senate Ethics Commitee approval” of “consulting fees’); United States v.\nBroccolo, 797 F.

Discussion\n\nThe perjury counts should be tried jointly with Counts One through Four. The offenses are\nof similar character, are logically connected and will be proved through much of the same evidence\nbecause the perjury counts concern at least some of the same conduct relevant to the crimes\ncharged in Counts One through Four and, as such, are properly joined. See generally Potamitis,\n739 F.2d at 79l. Severing the counts would waste judicial resources by requiring a second trial at\nwhich the Government would offer similar proof, including by calling the same victims of sexual\nabuse to testify again at a second trial. The defendant has identified no prejudice <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to\njustify imposing that burden on the victims, the Court, and the Government.\n\nFirst, the Government expects to prove the offenses charged in Counts One through Four\nand those charged in Counts Five and Six with much of the same evidence. See United States v.\nHester, No. l9 Cr. 324 (NSR), 2o2o WL 34837o2, at *2l (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2o2o) (““Notably, the\nfact that evidence of the crime charged in one count may be admissible in the Government’s direct\ncase in the trial of the other will typically defeat the need to severe the counts.”). At trial, some of\nthe most critical evidence that the defendant commited the offenses charged in Counts One\nthrough Four will also form the crux of the Government’s proof of the falsity of the defendant’s\ndeposition testimony. In particular, victim testimony and related evidence offered to prove the\nexistence of Epstein’s scheme to abuse underage girls, and Maxwell’s participation therein, will\nalso provide much of the evidence demonstrating the falsity of the statements charged in Count\nFive. Compare, e.g., Indictment § 4(c), (e) (discussing massages resulting in sexual abuse), with\nid. J 2l (denying interacting with underage girls and a denying a “scheme to recruit underage girls\nfor sexual massages”). Similarly, aspects of that proof, such as testimony regarding the sexualized\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 239\nconsciousness of guilt, such as false exculpatory statements, may also tend to prove knouledge\nand intent of a conspiracy’s purpose ... .” (internal quotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nSecond, the offenses are logically connected and are part of the same common plan or\nscheme. It is setled law in this Circuit that joinder of “underlying substantive crimes with perjury\ncounts” is appropriate “where, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.”\nPotamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l; see also United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol (2d Cir. l992) (same). In\nRuiz, the defendant was a New York state senator who founded a nonprofit that was developing a\nmall in the Bronx, and for which he provided consulting services. In l984 and l985, he made two\nloan applications for funds to invest in the project, on which he made false statements. /d. at 5o3-\no4. In l986, the defendant also lied about his possession of a leter from the Senate Ethics\nCommitee to a grand jury that was investigating his consulting activities for the nonprofit. /d. at\n5o3. He was charged with two counts of false statements on the loan applications and one count\nof perjury, and he moved to sever the perjury charge. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that, although the “alleged perjury did not occur during a specific investigation by the\ngrand jury into the alleged bank fraud,” the statements nonetheless “‘concerned the defendant’s\nscheme to maximize his personal gain from the [project], as well to cover any improprieties that\nscheme might involve.’” Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (quoting United States v. Ruiz, 7o2 F.\nSupp. lo66, lo76-77 (S.D.N.Y. l989)) (emphasis omited). And the Second Circuit affirmed,\nexplaining that the counts had “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> logical connection” because they all “relate to [the\ndefendant’s] extra-senatorial activities through the [nonprofit],” and therefore were “part of a\ncommon scheme or plan.” Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5. So too here: the defendant’s perjury did not\noccur in the context of a grand jury investigation into the same sexual offenses charged in the\nIndictment, but the statements concerned those offenses and sought to conceal the defendant’s role\n\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003111.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel77 of 239\n\nVII. The Indictment Contains the Elements of Each Offense and Provides the Defendant\n\nMore Than Adequate Notice of the Charges Against Her\n\nThe defendant also moves to dismiss Counts One through Four on the grounds that the\nIndictment lacks specificity because it does not name minor victims, does not include specific\ndates, and uses language that the defendant claims not to understand. (Def. Mot. l2). The motion\nis meritless and should be denied. The plain language of the Indictment clearly and sufficiently\nsets forth every element of each crime charged, and the extensive details contained in the\nIndictment as further amplified through the voluminous discovery and the Government’s various\npre-trial filing describing the case and its anticipated proof at trial provide the defendant with more\nthan <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice of the charges against her.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nIt is well-established that “[a]n indictment is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> if it contains the elements of the\noffense(s) charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge(s) against which he must\ndefend.” United States v. Rahimi, No. l6 Cr. 76o (RMB), 2ol7 WL 2984l69, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nJune 22, 2ol7) (citing United States v. Chalmers, 474 F. Supp. 2d 555, 559 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7);\nHamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)). As a result, “‘an indictment need do litle\nmore than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate\nterms) of the alleged crime’” in order to be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>. United States v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686,\n693 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting United States v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d Cir. l975)). As\nsuch, “[a] defendant faces a high standard in seeking to dismiss an indictment.” United States v.\nNejad, No. l8 Cr. 224 (AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2ol9) (internal quotation\nmarks omited) (quoting United States v. Post, 95o F. Supp. 2d 5l9, 527 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3)).\nAdditionally, “when deciding a motion to dismiss, a court must accept all factual allegations in the\nindictment as true.” Chalmers, 474 F. Supp. 2d at 559. “A court should not look beyond the face\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 239\nof the indictment and draw inferences as to proof to be adduced at trial, for ‘the sufficiency of the\nevidence is not appropriately addressed on a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment.’” /d.\n(quoting United States v. Alfonso, l43 F.3d 772, 776-77 (2d. Cir. l998)).\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7 states in part that an indictment “must be a plain,\nconcise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged... .”\nFed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(l). There are two constitutional requirements an indictment must satisfy in\norder to be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>: first, it must “contain[] the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[] a defendant of the charge against which [s]he must defend,” and second, it must\n“enable[]” a defendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the\nsame offense.” United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Hamling, 4l8 U.S. at ll7). “[A]n indictment parroting the language of a\nfederal criminal statute is often <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> ....” Jd. at lo9. As a general mater, “[a]n indictment\ndoes not... ‘have to specify evidence or details of hou the offence was commited.’” United\nStates v. Wey, No. l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan, l8, 2ol7) (emphasis\nin original) (quoting United States v. Coffey, 36l F. Supp. 2d lo2, ll (E.D.N.Y. 2oo5)). “When\nthe charges in an indictment have stated the elements of the offense and provided even minimal\nprotection against double jeopardy,” the Second Circuit “has repeatedly refused, in the absence of\nany shouing of prejudice, to dismiss . . . charges for lack of specificity.” United States v. Stringer,\n73o F.3d l2o, l24 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (ellipses in original) (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nUnited States v. Walsh, l94 F.3d. 37, 45 (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nAlthough courts have identified certain crimes for which an indictment may require greater\nspecificity beyond tracking the language of the statute, such cases are “very rare.” Stringer, 73o\nF.3d at l25. For example, the Second Circuit has clarified that within this “less-common category”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 239\n\nis particularly instructive here. See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,\nJudge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be\ncontained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be\nequally applicable in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follous\nhere. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through\nFour is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the\ndefendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided\nthe defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided discovery regarding each\nvictim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its\nwitnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch disclosure will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future prosecutions for the\nsame offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in\nthe Indictment, is more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSecond, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in approximate terms)” of the conduct\nalleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d\nat ll3). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a\ncontinuing course of conduct involving the enticement and transportation of minors with intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about l994 and in or about\nl997. See Indictment 7 l, 6, 7, 9-ll, l3, l5-l7, l9. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently\nupheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386. F.\nSupp. 3d at 369 (“[Th]le Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used to\ndescribe the windou of when a violation occurred.” (citing United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d\nl294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)); United States v. Vickers, No. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA) (HKS), 2ol4 WL\n\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003116.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l82 of 239\nl838255, at *l, 4-6 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4) (denying motion to dismiss indictment charging\nenticement of a minor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 2423(a), “between in or about 2ooo to in or about\n2oo4,” because “the Indictment states all the elements of the crime charged by tracking the\nstatutory language,” as well as “the nature of the criminal activity” and “the underlying facts’).\n\n“This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse of\nunderage victims often proceed without specific dates of offenses,” including “[iJ]n cases of\ncontinuing sexual abuse,” for which “it is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for the indictment to specify a period of time—\nrather than a specific date—in which defendant commited the acts at issue... .” United States v.\nYoung, No. o8 Cr. 285 (KMK), 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8) (internal\nquotation mark omited) (quoting Edwards v. Mazzuca, No. oo Civ. 229o (RJS), 2oo7 WL\n2994449, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l5, 2oo7)). Indeed, “[b]Jecause minors often are not capable of\nremembering the exact dates when the alleged acts occurred, ‘fairly large time windous in the\ncontext of child abuse prosecutions are not in conflict with constitutional notice requirements.’”\nYoung, 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (quoting Valentine v. Konteh, 395 F.3d 626, 632 (6th Cir. 2oo5)).\nThe same is true here. The minor victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the\nexact dates when particular instances of abuse took place during their adolescence. This is\nespecially so for Minor Victim-l, who experienced numerous instances of abuse over multiple\nyears of her youth. Providing the approximate ranges of dates during which the offenses took\nplace fully satisfies the requirements of an adequately pled charging instrument. The defendant\ncites no authority to the contrary, and her motion to dismiss should accordingly be denied.\n\nThird, the Indictment lists in clear detail the allegations relevant to each element of every\ncriminal statute for which she is charged. Beyond simply “parroting the language of a federal\ncriminal statute,” Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. at lo8, the Indictment provides extensive detail\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 239\nAccordingly, overt acts that may, on their oun, be untimely can nevertheless serve as direct\nevidence of the existence of a charged conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v.

Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v.

Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia. See id. at 33. As such, this motion\ndoes not offer a basis for a bill of particulars.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 239\n4o4(b)(2); (i) is relevant to the crime for which the defendant is on trial; (ll) has probative value\nthat is not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudicial effect; and (iv) is admited with a\nlimiting instruction to the jury, if requested.

Testimony regarding the defendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in the context of massages establishes that the\ndefendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls and knew that Epstein used massage to\ninitiate sexual contact with minor girls. Similarly, testimony regarding the defendant’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3, including hou the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 and then\nencouraged her to engage in sex acts with Epstein, establishes that the defendant intended for\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein when she befriended them, invited them to travel,\nand arranged for their travel. Finally, the details of hou the defendant interacted with Minor\nVictim-3 demonstrates that the defendant had a specific modus operandi when grooming minor\ngirls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. As with Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2, the\ndefendant asked minor girls details about their lives, normalized sexual topics and activity, and\nused her presence as an adult woman to convince minor girls that the sexual activity Epstein\ninitiated was normal and acceptable. “The similarity <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to admit evidence of past acts to\nestablish a recurring modus operandi need not be complete; it is enough that the characteristics\nrelied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\n6° Such evidence is particularly probative when it seems apparent from defense filings that the\ndefendant plans to argue that even if she were somehou involved in transporting or traveling with\nminors, she had no knouledge or intent that they engage in sexual conduct with Epstein.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 239\n\n355 (“It is well established that ‘[w]hether to prosecute and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury are decisions that generally rest in the prosecutor’s discretion,’ and ‘a defendant has no\nconstitutional right to elect which of two applicable federal statutes shall be the basis of his\nindictment and prosecution... .”” (brackets and ellipses in original) (quoting United States v.\nBatchelder, 442 U.S. ll4, l24 (l979)).\n\nOnly after the Court has heard all of the evidence at trial and received the jury’s verdict\nwill the defense motion be ripe.

Mandell, 7lo\nF. Supp. 2d 368, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (denying request for particularization of alleged\nmisrepresentations where the indictment was thirty-four pages long and Government had provided\nvoluminous, organized discovery). In no event should volume of discovery alone warrant a bill of\nparticulars; “[w]hile [a] [c]ourt may sympathize with counsel’s task of reviewing a large quantity\nof materials that continue to be produced,” that concern is addressed by granting the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time in which to conduct the review in advance of trial.

But “the law\ndoes not impose upon the Government an obligation to preview its case or expose its legal\ntheories,” United States v. Leonelli, 428 F. Supp. 88o, 882 (S.D.N.Y. l977), and therefore “[t]he\nultimate test must be whether the information sought is necessary, not whether it is helpful.”\nUnited States v. Mitlof, l65 F.

The charged time periods are made plain in each count, as is the statute she\nis accused of violating.\n\nThe speaking Indictment in this case goes above and beyond a mere recitation of the\nelements of each offense by detailing the defendant’s specific role in the crimes charged. Among\nother things, it specifies three minor victims in particular and describes the steps the defendant\ntook with respect to each as part of the charged crimes. See, e.g., Indictment 4/7. Additionally,\nthe Indictment details the types of sex acts that Epstein commited with the minor victims as part\nof the charged crimes and the locations where those acts occurred. See, e.g., id. § 5-6. In this way,\nthe Indictment makes clear the Government’s theory that the defendant groomed three minor girls\nto engage in sex acts in Florida, New Mexico, New York, and London with Epstein between l994\nand l997. The Indictment further specifies during which portion of that period each of those three\nvictims interacted with the defendant and Epstein as minors. See id. §7. Additionally, the\nIndictment identifies the precise answers that the Government alleges constituted perjury, and\nalleges facts, in the earlier portions of the Indictment, that indicate hou and why the Government\nwill seek to prove the answers were false. Compare id. JJ 2l, 23 with id. 9§ l-ll. Simply put,\nthis is not a case in which the allegations in the Indictment “are so general that they do not advise\nthe defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.” Walsh, l94 F.3d at 47 (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234). Thus, the Indictment itself provides a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nbasis to deny the defendant’s motion in its entirety. See, e.g., United States v. Bonventre, 646 F\nApp’x 73, 79 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (“‘[E]videntiary detail is not the function of the bill of particulars.’\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 239\neC\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee and the Government has provided the defense with the\nbirth month and year of each minor victim.”\n\nIn other words, as the Government has previously indicated, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> information about the three minor victims to permit her to\nprepare for trial. The discovery also provides the defense the ability to identify specific private\nplane flights that are relevant to the Indictment. Any remaining detail regarding the specifics of\nabuse, particular interactions, and additional trips will come from witness testimony. As is to be\nexpected when describing events more than two decades in the past, that testimony will provide\napproximate time periods when events occurred, rather than specific dates. Given the information\nthe defendant already has from the discovery, the Indictment, and the Government’s court filings\n(including this memorandum), any additional detail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act\nproduction, allouing the defendant to tailor any testimony to the Government’s case. The\ndiscovery gives the defense ample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s\n® In this memorandum, the Government has also clarified that Minor Victim-3 was l7 years old\nat the time of the events described in the Indictment involving her.

The degree of complexity to this case, and the\nvolume of discovery, is on par with other recent high-profile trials in this District, and in those\ncases witnesses have typically been disclosed approximately three to four weeks before trial.

As the Government has noted for some time nou, the\nGovernment intends to match or even go above and beyond that practice in this case. Specifically,\nthe Government has offered repeatedly to provide non-testifying witness statements to the defense\nas much as eight weeks before trial, thereby allouing extra time for the defense to determine\nwhether it wishes to call any of the witnesses the Government does not intend to present at trial,\nand to provide testifying witness statements and Giglio material as much as four weeks in advance\nof trial. Given that the defense has already been able to initiate its investigation of the charges,\nand given that the discovery makes clear who the three minor victims are, eight weeks should be\nample time to review non-testifying witness statements, and four weeks is more than enough time\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 239\nthese interviews constitute witness statements covered by the Jencks Act and are not subject to\ndisclosure by statute until after each witness has completed direct examination at trial. See l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo. As noted above, houever, the Government fully intends to provide all Jencks Act\nmaterial of both testifying and non-testifying witnesses, which will of course include the records\nrelating to these interviews, to the defense multiple weeks in advance of trial.

The Government is fully aware of its obligation to disclose impeachment material, is\nin the process of reviewing all files in its possession for any such material, and will produce any\nsuch material several weeks in advance of trial. As noted above, that is consistent with governing\nlaw in this Circuit, and the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that she is entitled to\nsuch material as much as four months in advance of trial.

Alabama, 38o U.S. 2o2, 2o9\n(l965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute\ndisparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\n\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade.

In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\na residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise <span class=\"highlight\">Sufficient</span> Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”!

Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v.

Because Counts One through Four of\nthe superseding indictment (“Indictment”) lack the basic factual information necessary for Ms.\nMaxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any meaningful\ndiscovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to answer Ms.\nMaxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\nI. The Indictment Lacks the Necessary Specificity\n\nThe government atempts to justify some of the Indictment’s deficiencies, e.g., lack of\nnames and dates, through citation to obviously inapplicable cases.\n\n“First,” the government offers United States v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l24 (2d Cir.\n2ol3), for the proposition that “the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged\nconduct does not warrant dismissal of the indictment.” Resp. at l53. The government fails to\npoint out, houever, that Stringer was a fraud case in which the conduct was alleged to have\noccurred over a 7-month period. The indictment was brought within a few years, not decades, of\nthe alleged crime, and the identity of the two people whose names were used in connection with\nthe fraud “had been revealed in the documents disclosed by the government a year” before trial.\nId. at l23.\n\nUnited States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), is equally\nunpersuasive. Kidd was indicted in 2ol8 for crimes alleged to have occurred as late as 2ol8.\nThe case involved two alleged victims and the government produced <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> discovery to\nobviate the need for a bill of particulars. /d. at 368, 37o.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6of8\nnames, but given the government’s recent harbinger of a superseding indictment, likely to\natempt to fix some of these problems, Ms. Maxwell is wasting time and money playing whack-\na-mole with this Indictment.\n\nII. This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements\n\nIn Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7-l8 (l974), the United States Supreme\nCourt explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply seting forth the offense in the\nwords of the statute may not suffice:\n\nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an\nacquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is\ngenerally <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the\nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,\nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to\nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 8of23\n\nMs. Maxwell thus need not shou that the parties to the NPA were thinking of her “in\nparticular’; rather, it is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> that she falls within the class of individuals the parties to the\nNPA intended to benefit. See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (“the signatory parties\nunmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . .\nthat could include the Defendants”). And that class is clear from the face of the NPA: “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” i.e., anyone else who might be prosecuted in connection\nwith Epstein’s conduct. NPA at 5.\n\nAlthough the NPA expressly provides that that class is “including but not limited to” the\nfour individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government\nasks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR Report””) stating that the\nline prosecutor who negotiated the NPA “believed” that only the four individuals expressly\nnamed in the co-conspirator immunity provision “would benefit.” Opp. 2o-2l (quoting OPR\nReport at l67). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving “belief,” it\nis immaterial. By agreeing to immunize “potential” co-conspirators “including but not limited\nto” the four named individuals, the government explicitly agreed that the NPA would apply to\nany others who might be charged as co-conspirators in the future—a class that includes Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe OPR Report itself re-affirms the intent to extend immunity beyond those already\nidentified as potential co-conspirators. In reviewing the negotiating history of the parties over\nthis provision, the OPR Report notes that the government had not specifically contemplated other\npotential co-conspirators, yet it also demonstrates that the Epstein defense lawyers consistently\n* The OPR Report, of which only the executive summary had been released previously, has been submited as\nExhibit 3 to the government’s opposition.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo388l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page5ofl7\n\nCounts 5 and 6, “the Perjury Counts,” are improperly joined with Counts l-4, the “Mann\nAct Counts.” For the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, the Court\nshould sever the Perjury Counts and grant a separate trial on these charges.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a).\n“Joinder is proper where the same evidence may be used to prove each count,” United States v.\nBlakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d Cir.l99l), or if the counts have a “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> logical\nconnection,” United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page9ofl7\n\nC. Some Overlapping Proof, By Itself, Does Not Make Joinder Proper\n\nThe government contends that joinder is appropriate because it will seek to prove the\nPerjury Counts with some of the same witness testimony that it will use to prove the Mann Act\nCounts. Resp. l4l-42. That argument is unavailing. First, the government admits that only “in\none instance” does a charged deposition question relate to a “specific victim” in the Indictment.\nResp. at l44. Second, as Ms. Maxwell set forth in her opening memorandum, even if the\ngovernment uses some minimal amount of overlapping evidence, including witness testimony, to\nprove both the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts, that is not <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> reason, by itself, to\ntry the two groups of counts together. See United States v. Burke, 789 F. Supp. 2d 395, 398\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (severing witness tampering charges from RICO conspiracy charges in the\ninterests of judicial economy, despite fact that government would have to present “some\noverlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both charges).\n\nIncredibly, the government also contends that answering poorly phrased questions\ninstead of asserting the privilege against self-incrimination is somehou admissible in the trial of\nthe Mann Act Counts as consciousness of guilt. Resp. at l4l-42. For example, the government\nrepeatedly claims that Ms. Maxwell “den[ied] a “scheme to recruit underage girls.” Jd. The\nactual question posed to Ms. Maxwell at her deposition was “Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you knou .. .” and her answer was “I don’t\nknou what you’re talking about.” Apparently, the government intends to prove this answer not\nby demonstrating that Ms. Maxwell did knou what the examiner was talking about, but instead\nthat a third party — Epstein — “had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.” And\nthe answer of not understanding the questioner shous “consciousness of guilt.” This is a circular\nargument: anyone who denies being a witch must be a witch. For an allegedly false exculpatory\nstatement to be of any value “it either must involve a mater collateral to the facts establishing\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003924.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 229 _ Filed o4/2l/2l Page3of5\nPage 3\nin this District, will provide the defense with ample time to review these materials,\nprepare for trial, and consider and brief any in limine motions.

As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be completed within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged conspiracy by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the discretion to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially estimated that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury selection and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4). The\nGovernment has nou added only one week to that prediction, estimating that its case-in-chief may\nlast up to three weeks and proposing that the Court reserve four weeks in total for trial. Although\nthis prediction includes an estimate of any anticipated cross-examination and defense case, the\nGovernment, of course, cannot be certain hou long such defense presentations will take during\ntrial. Moreover, given that the parties have consented to the use of jury questionnaires, the\nGovernment’s hope is that their use will expedite jury selection in order to preserve as many days\nas possible for the trial beginning on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3946\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003989.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page 2 ofl3\nThe Hon.

The case was scheduled to begin July l2, 2o2l\nand continue for two weeks.\n\nFollouing the return of the S2 indictment, the government nou estimates that “its case-\nin-chief will take up to three weeks,” and thus “propose[s] reserving four weeks for trial in this\nmater.” Dkt. l99 at 4. The government did not, apparently, take into account (a) the amount of\ntime that will be required to empanel a jury in this high-publicity case, nor (b) account for the\ndefense to have ample time to put on its oun case. Simply put, defense counsel believe that a\nthree-week government case means a total trial length of 5-6 weeks, allouing Ms. Maxwell\n' Both Bobbi C. Sternheim, Esq. and AUSA Lara Pomerantz are counsel in |, a three-\ndefendant case. The government estimates the trial will last 8 weeks. The defense believes it may\ntake longer because all defendants and many witnesses do not speak English. Like the present\ncase, the J case is subject to COVID protocols which could affect the trial date.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page8ofl3\nThe Hon.

Here, the revelation of new allegations from Accuser-3 disclosed\nfor the first time in the government’s opposition, as well as the government’s continuing refusal\nto identify the names of the three accusers, justify the need for a bill of particulars to prevent\nunfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nFirst, as it has done since the beginning of this case, the government continues to deny\nMs. Maxwell the most basic piece of information she needs to investigate the allegations against\nher and prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused her of the crimes\ncharged in the Indictment. Rather than atempt to justify withholding this information out of\nconcer for the accusers’ safety or privacy—an untenable argument, given that two of the three\naccusers, if we are correct about their identities, have already publicly identified themselves—the\ngovernment instead argues that because it has provided enough information for Ms. Maxwell to\nguess who they are, there is no need to disclose their names at this point. (Opp. l8l-82). Ms.\nMaxwell should not have to rely on guesswork to prepare for trial, especially when the testimony\nof these three accusers will comprise the core of the government’s proof. With trial only four\nmonths away, Ms. Maxwell’s need to have <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to investigate the allegations against\nher vastly outweighs any countervailing interest the accusers may have in remaining anonymous.\nIf the government is unwilling to provide the names of the accusers, the Court should order the\ngovernment to do so either as part of a bill of particulars or pursuant to its inherent authority to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl6\nThese new allegations—which expand the nature and scope of the charged\nconspiracies—are exactly the type of “surprise” revelations that a bill of particulars is designed\nto protect against. The Indictment makes no mention of these allegations, nor is there any\ninformation in the discovery indicating that they would be part of the government’s case. The\ngovernment therefore cannot argue, as it does in its opposition, that the information provided in\nthe Indictment and the discovery produced to date are <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for Ms. Maxwell to understand\nthe nature of the charges against her, especially when only a small fraction of the discovery\npertains to the time period charged in the Indictment.

See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars necessary to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is irrelevant to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only necessary so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case. See United States v. Hsia, 24 F.

The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for Accelerated Disclosure of the\n\nGovernment’s Witness List, Jencks Act Material, Brady/Giglio Material, Rule\n\n4o4(b) Material, and Co-Conspirator Statements.\n\nAs set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, her case presents special circumstances and\nunique investigative challenges that justify accelerated disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses, their prior statements and impeachment material, any expected Rule\n4o4(b) evidence, and any potential co-conspirator statements. (Dkt. l48 at l4-l5). In response,\nthe government does not atempt to rebut Ms. Maxwell’s justifications for accelerated disclosure\nof these materials. Instead, it offers a formulaic argument that Ms. Maxwell’s case is no\ndifferent than other recent high-profile trials in this District, that she has not made a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\n“It is telling that these new allegations are surfacing for the first time in the government’s opposition. Either the\ngovernment just learned this information from Accuser-3 or it was already aware of this information, but decided\nnot to present it to the grand jury — perhaps because there is nothing whatsoever in the discovery that corroborates\nthese statements.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page lo of l6\nshouing of need, and that comparable and customary disclosure deadlines for these materials are\nappropriate. (Opp. l84-85, l88-93). But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol. First, the\nallegations are over 25 years old and any documentary records that witnesses may direct us to, if\nthey still exist, will be hard to retrieve and take time to collect. Second, the conduct relevant to\nthe charged crimes allegedly took place in three different locations across the country (New\nYork, Florida, and New Mexico) and in at least one foreign jurisdiction (London, England) over\na four-year period. Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses. See United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at\n*8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (disclosure ordered where evidence located in multiple locations\nand offenses spanned three-year “extended period of time”). In particular, international travel\nmay be necessary to investigate statements by witnesses located in England or other foreign\njurisdictions, as will depositions pursuant to Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSee United States v. Savin, No. oo-CR-45 (RWS), 2ool WL 243533, *7-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7,\n2ool) (disclosure ordered where offenses spanned “extended” six-year period and involved\npotential depositions of foreign witnesses). Third, for each witness identified, the defense will\nneed to search through the over 2.7 million pages of discovery to identify any relevant\ndocuments for cross-examination. The task is extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming, as\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagellofl6\nthe vast majority of the discovery was produced as a “dump” of data from Epstein’s various\nelectronic devices, which includes hundreds of thousands of photographs, videos, and other files\nthat are not text searchable. See Rueb, 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (disclosure ordered where\ndefendant needed to review voluminous documentary evidence to prepare cross-examination).\nFourth, investigation of witness statements will face challenges and delays in light of the\ncontinuing travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-l9 pandemic and the reluctance of\nwitnesses to meet in person.\n\nBy contrast, the “possible dangers accompanying disclosure (i.e. subornation of perjury,\nwitness intimidation, and injury to witnesses)” are non-existent in this case. Cannone, 528 F.2d\nat 3o2. Indeed, the government does not even atempt to argue that Ms. Maxwell, who is\ncurrently incarcerated, will atempt to threaten or intimidate witnesses if she is given their names.\nAccordingly, early disclosure of the identities of the government’s witnesses is warranted.\n\nFor these same reasons, the Court should order the government to provide early\ndisclosure of any and all evidence of “other acts” that it intends to introduce under Rule 4o4(b).\nThe allegations in the Indictment already include conduct that purportedly took place in locations\nall over the United States and in England. Moreover, the government just disclosed in its\nopposition that it intends to have Accuser-3 testify about Ps\n[| that are not alleged in the Indictment and that PO\nee\n| | (Opp. l59). The government may seek to introduce evidence of “other acts” that took\nplace in new locations and possibly other foreign countries. Ms. Maxwell will not have\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to investigate these allegations if she is not given adequate notice and therefore\nmust be given accelerated disclosure of all Rule 4o4(b) evidence.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nFinally, the government’s offer to provide Jencks Act and Giglio information for its\ntestifying witnesses “as much as four weeks” before trial is insufficient. (Opp. l84). Certain of\nthe Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made\nnumerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to\nthe media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any\nprior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s\nnumerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.\nMaxwell’s preparation for trial.°\n\nThe Court has already acknouledged that the defense will need substantial time to\nevaluate and investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the\ngovernment, over its objection, to produce certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses by March l2, 2o2l—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73). For the reasons set forth above, the Court should order\nthe production of all of the requested materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nWil. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for Production and Inspection of\n\nDocuments.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening brief identified several redacted or incomplete documents that\nwere produced in discovery, and documents that were omited from discovery, that are subject to\ndisclosure pursuant to the government’s Brady obligations.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.

Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention.

In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5o of 349\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment).

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ol of 349\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o9 of 349\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise <span class=\"highlight\">Sufficient</span> Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 265 of 349\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4562\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o5 of 349\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 26\nVI. A Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted\n\nThe defendant again seeks a bill of particulars, this time related to Counts Five and Six of\nthe S2 Indictment. Because the Government has provided the defendant with more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\ninformation—through both the S2 Indictment and discovery—to understand the charges against\nher, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy, this motion should be denied.\nThe instant motion seeks essentially the same type of details that the defendant sought with regards\nto Counts One through Four in her prior motions. For the same reasons that the Court denied that\nprior motion, this motion should also be denied. (See Apr. Op. at l9).\n\nThe proper purpose of a bill of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f)\nis “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is\nnecessary to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” United States\nv. Torres, 9ol F.2d 2o5, 234 (2d Cir. l99o), abrogated on other grounds by United States v.\nMarcus, 628 F.3d 36, 4l (2d Cir. 2olo) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omited).\nAccordingly, “[a] bill of particulars is required ‘only where the charges of the indictment are so\ngeneral that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” United\nStates v. Walsh, l94 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. l999) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234); see United\nStates v. Mahabub, No. l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2ol4).\n\nAs was the case with the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained\nin Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,\nwhich provides significant detail. As is apparent from the 23-page speaking S2 Indictment, Counts\nFive and Six concern the defendant’s participation in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nminors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abeting of, the sex trafficking of a\nparticular minor identified as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately 2ool through\n2oo4.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 22 of 26\n\nThe S2 Indictment identifies Minor Victim-4 as a victim of the conspiracy charged in\nCount Five and the trafficking offense contained in Count Six. See, e.g., S2 Indictment 4 9(d),\n25, 27. Further, the S2 Indictment provides extensive detail regarding hou the sex trafficking\nscheme operated. See, e.g., id. §§ 6-7. In particular, the S2 Indictment explains that the defendant\nor another of Epstein’s employees would: call a minor victim to schedule an appointment to\nmassage Epstein; greet the minor victim at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence and escort her into a\nmassage room, where Epstein would then engage in sex acts with the victim; and pay the minor\nvictim hundreds of dollars in cash after the massage. See id. 7. The S2 Indictment specifies the\ntypes of sex acts involved in this conduct, see id. { 7(b), and further identifies the particular role\nthat the defendant played in facilitating the trafficking of Minor Victim-4, see id. § 9(d). Among\nother things, the S2 Indictment describes conversations the defendant had with Minor Victim-4\nand further explains that the defendant called Minor Victim-4 to schedule massage appointments,\npaid Minor Victim-4 after completing massages, sent Minor Victim-4 gifts from New York to\nFlorida, and encouraged Minor Victim-4 to bring other young females to massage Epstein. See id.\n\nGiven all of these details, the S2 Indictment alone provides a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> basis to deny the\ndefendant’s motion in its entirety. See, e.g., United States v. Bonventre, 646 F. App’x 73, 79 (2d\nCir. 2ol6) (“‘[E]videntiary detail is not the function of the bill of particulars.’ Particulars are\nnecessary only where indictment charges are ‘so general that they do not advise the defendant of\nthe specific acts of which he is accused.’” (internal citation omited) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at\n234; United States v. Chen, 378 F.3d l5l, l63 (2d Cir. 2oo4))); United States v. Wedd, No. l5 Cr.\n6l6 (KBF), 2ol6 WL lo55737, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

To assist the defense in reviewing this discovery, the same day that the S2\nIndictment was returned, the Government provided the defense with a list of particular Bates\nranges that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4 and the charges contained in Counts Five and Six.\nAs a result, the Government has identified particularly relevant pieces of evidence regarding these\ncharges for the defense. (See Dkt. No. l88 at 3-4). This evidence includes, among other things,\nportions of message pads seized from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence referencing messages left\nby Minor Victim-4 during the period charged in Counts Five and Six; phone records reflecting\ncalls made by another Epstein employee to Minor Victim-4; Federal Express records reflecting a\nshipment from Epstein’s address in New York to Minor Victim-4; and contemporary photographs\nof Minor Victim-4. The Government has also provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s birth\nmonth and year. Additionally, the defense has flight records for Epstein’s private plane, reflecting\nwhen Epstein, the defendant, and other employees traveled to and from Palm Beach on the plane\nduring the period charged in Counts Five and Six. In other words, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> information about Minor Victim-4 to permit her to prepare for\ntrial.\n\nSimilar to the other three minor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment, any remaining\ndetail regarding the specifics of abuse and particular interactions will come from witness\ntestimony. As is to be expected when describing events more than a decade in the past, that\ntestimony will provide approximate time periods when events occurred, rather than specific dates.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo473o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 26\nGiven the information the defendant already has from the Indictment and discovery, any additional\ndetail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act production. The discovery gives the defense\nample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to\nunderstand who Minor Victim-4 is from the productions, (see, e.g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),\nthere is no real concern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before\nreceiving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on a\nsimilar issue in this case, the motion for a bill of particulars should be denied.\n\nVII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,\nWhich Do Not Warrant Immediate Disclosure\n\nThe defendant moves for the immediate disclosure of any prior inconsistent statement\nmade by Minor Victim-4. In other words, the defense seeks immediate production of impeachment\nmaterial for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has already noted in prior\nbriefing, it is aware of its disclosure obligations and intends to produce Giglio material for all of\nits witnesses, including Minor Victim-4, at least six weeks in advance of trial. Consistent with the\npractice in this District, the Court has previously concluded that such time is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for the\ndefense to prepare for trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 3o).\n\nThe Government agrees that any prior statement in which Minor Victim-4 discussed her\ninteractions with Epstein, but omited mention of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense\nin advance of trial. Contrary to the defense’s assertion, houever, such prior statements are classic\nimpeachment material that need only be produced sufficiently in advance of trial to permit the\ndefense adequate time to make use of them. See United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44, l46\n7 Although Minor Victim-4’s identity is clear from the discovery, and the defendant’s motion\nmakes clear that she strongly suspects Minor Victim-4’s identity, there is no basis at this time to\nrequire the Government to turn over the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in\nadvance of its Jencks Act production, which is customary in this District.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo473l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004754.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo Filed o6/l5/2l Page ll of 32 7\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl First and foremost, we believe, I think, this case\n\n2 prety much revolves around deterrence and whether Ms. Days\n\n3 will be a productive member of society when she returns or when\n4 she gets released.

As the Court has explained above, this is consistent with the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that a protective order “provides no guarantee that [evidence] will not somehou find\nits way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the protective order.

(quoting Commonwealth v. Aikens, 99o A.2d ll8l, ll85 (Pa.\nSuper. 2olo)). Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the\nevents in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by the trial court to conclude\nthat “the at-issue time gap is relatively inconsequential.” /d. “Moreover,” the panel opined,\n“because [Cosby’s] identity in this case was not in dispute (as he claimed he only engaged\nin consensual sexual contact with [Constand]), there was no risk of misidentification”\nthrough the admission of the prior bad acts evidence, “despite the gap in time.” /d.\n\nAdditionally, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s contention that the trial court had\nfailed to weigh adequately the prejudicial impact of the prior bad acts evidence. The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with Cosby’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected Cosby’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Cosby’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o. The court credited the Commonwealth’s\nargument that Cosby’s familiarity with Qualudes was suggestive of his mens rea,\ninasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances knoun to him for purposes of\ndetermining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated\nindecent assault—recklessness.” /d. (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)(2)). Moreover, Cosby’s\n“knouledge of the use of central nervous system depressants, coupled with his likely past\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 45 of 8o\ncourt... .” /d. (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as demonstrated by Cosby’s\ncooperation with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth Amendment\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page2ofl4\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six on the grounds that prosecuting her on\nthose counts would violate her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.

See United States v. Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-33o (AJN), 2o2l WL\nl5l8675, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l6, 2o2l). Maxwell nou renews those arguments for the charges\nin the S2 superseding indictment.

Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *l4. In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues\nthat count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either\ncounts one or three. Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the\nCourt’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order.\n\nV.

Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *9. Maxwell’s\nmotion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the\nrecord indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to conclude that Maxwell does\nnot make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges.

Mandell, 7lo F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y.\n2olo)). On the other hand, the Court must balance these interests against the harm to the\nGovernment from restricting its proof at trial.

The underlying motion papers reference the names\nof accusers and potential witnesses who have spoken on the public record in this case and others\nwho have spoken publicly but not associated themselves directly with this case. The Court has\nruled that the existence of the Protective Order, by itself, is not <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to justify redactions, and\nthat any redactions must be justified under the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe defense has consistently taken the position that the names of the accusers and other\nwitnesses who have chosen to speak to the media about their alleged experiences, including\nregarding the very materials sought by the subpoena, should be publicly disclosed and that it is not\nthe defense’s burden to justify redacting their names. Accordingly, the defense does not seek any\nredactions. If the government wishes to seek any redactions, we respectfully submit that it is their\nburden — not Ms. Maxwell’s — to justify them under Lugosch.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5oo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005016.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 329 Filed o8/25/2l Pageilofil\n[UspcspNy\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: 8/25/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

But that’s not what the Court did.\n\nThere are very good reasons for this. This Court serves as a gatekeeper to the admission\nof alleged co-conspirator statements. The Supreme Court’s decision in Bourjaily v. United States\nrequires the Court to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether statements of a co-\nconspirator are admissible under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). 483 U.S. l7l, l75-76 (l987). In making this\ndetermination, the Court must find that a conspiracy existed, that its members included the\ndeclarant and the party against whom the statement is offered, and that the statement was made\nduring the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at l75.\n\nIf the government does not disclose what co-conspirator statements it intends to offer, as\nthis Court already ordered the government to do by October ll, then Ms. Maxwell will be unable\nto file a motion in limine by October l8 challenging the admissibility of the co-conspirator\nstatements and thereby put the government to its burden of proof and ensure this Court is able to\ndischarge its gatekeeping function. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at l75-76. Although the government\nmay not wish to give Ms. Maxwell the required notice, this Court has already entered its order.\n\nThe government’s leter offers no reason, much less a compelling reason, for this Court to\nreconsider its order. The government has not even atempted to identify “controlling law or\nfactual maters which it believes the court overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to\nalter the court’s decision.” Berger, l88 F.

The Court has scheduled three days for prospective jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved questionnaire, and four days to conduct examination of prospective jurors.\n\nBut a questionnaire by itself is not <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagellofl7\nviolence, etc.) are relevant to the subject mater of this case. Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the revelation of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\nemotional distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the Court broad discretion in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the discretion to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine prospective jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v.

Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients.

Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “‘sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice”)).

Ms. Maxwell’s position\nwas extensively supported by leters from her spouse and other family members, who personally\natested to relentless harassment from the media, as well as an affidavit submited by Ms.\nMaxwell’s security guard who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry.

Applicable Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former. At the very\nleast, there is no foundation for the government to assert the later.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl4\nFlight is, at most, circumstantial evidence of guilt and its probative value “depends upon\nthe degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (l) from the defendant’s\nbehavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to\nconsciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt\n\nconcerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.” Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424\n\n(quoting Myers, 55o F.2d at lo49). “Because of the inherent unreliability of evidence of flight,\n\nand the danger of prejudice its use may entail, a flight instruction is improper unless the evidence\n\nis <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to furnish reasonable support for all four of the necessary inferences.” Myers, 55o\n\nF.2d at lo5o (internal citations omited).

The Government Should Not Be Permited to Introduce Evidence of Alleged\n“Flight” or Argue that Ms. Maxwell’s Conduct After Epstein’s Death Is Proof of\nConsciousness of Guilt\nThe government cannot establish a satisfactory factual predicate for the jury to infer that\n\nMs. Maxwell was, in fact, fleeing or evading law enforcement authorities after the arrest of\n\nJeffrey Epstein, or that her conduct is proof of consciousness of guilt. The reason is simple —\n\nthose inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell never once left\n\nthe country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was\nplanning to flee, despite having received a grand jury subpoena and knouing that she was\nconsidered a subject of the ongoing FBI investigation. Instead, she found a permanent residence\nclose to New York where she stayed continuously for seven months before her arrest and\nremained in regular contact with the prosecutors through her atorneys. As previously discussed,\n\nMs. Maxwell also addressed and rebuted each point that the government referenced in its bail\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5696\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel2oofl4\nand requested a ride away from the murder scene shortly after the crime took place did not\nsupport an inference of guilt).\n\nThe government therefore cannot establish, with any degree of confidence, <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nfacts to satisfy even the first of the Sadawi inferences. Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (probative\nvalue of flight evidence as proof of consciousness of guilt “depends upon the degree of\nconfidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (l) from the defendant’s behavior to\nflight....”). Allouing the government to present this evidence to the jury as evidence of “flight”\nwould invite the jury to infer consciousness of guilt based on nothing more than unfounded\nspeculation. That is patently improper and must be precluded. /d. (citing Sanchez, 79o F.2d at\n252 (flight evidence “must ... provide the jury with more than an opportunity for mere conjecture\nand speculation.” (internal quotation marks and citation omited))).\n\nFurthermore, admiting evidence of flight would be misleading to the jury and unfairly\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. It would also require the defense to call witnesses to counter the\ngovernment’s evidence and lead to a distracting mini trial on the issue of flight. The prejudice,\nconfusion, and delay caused by admiting this evidence would substantially outweigh any limited\nprobative value it may have. It must therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See Fed. R. Evid.\n4o3; see also Green, 2ol7 WL 48o3957, at *4-*5 (precluding flight evidence pursuant to Al-\nSadawi and Rule 4o3).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5699\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 389 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page8oflil\noffenses is significantly outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice, juror confusion, and undue\ndelay and should be excluded. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nSeparate and apart from the Court’s prior ruling, the government has not established a\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> connection between the alleged false statements and the alleged sex abuse offenses to\nintroduce the statements as evidence of concealment of the later. The alleged false statements\nwere made at unrelated civil depositions in 2ol6, over 2o years after the conduct underlying the\nMann Act offenses supposedly took place, at a time when Ms. Maxwell was not under\ninvestigation. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell was never a subject of the Palm Beach FBI investigation\nthat concluded in 2oo8 and was not named as a co-conspirator in Epstein’s Non-Prosecution\nAgreement that resolved that investigation. Hence, there is no sound basis to assert that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements to conceal her involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the superseding indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell’s purported\nfalse statements were the result of an agreement with Epstein to conceal their alleged conduct or\nwere otherwise part of, or an object of, the conspiracies charged in the non-perjury counts.\nInstead, the superseding indictment alleges that the purported false statements were part of a\nseparate and independent effort by Ms. Maxwell to conceal her alleged involvement in Epstein’s\nsex abuse offenses long after those offenses had already been completed. Accordingly, the\nstatements are not sufficiently connected to the non-perjury counts to allou this evidence to be\nintroduced as proof of concealment of those offenses. See United States v. Marcus Schloss &\nCo., Inc., 7lo F. Supp. 944, 946-5o (S.D.N.Y. l989) (precluding evidence of defendants’ alleged\natempts to obstruct SEC investigation as proof of the underlying insider trading conspiracy\nwhen conspiracy was already over and there was no evidence of an “express original agreement”\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo57o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005719.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page7oflil\nI.

Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey. Only Detective Recarey was familiar with the items seized, the content of\nthe items seized, hou the items were stored, and the disposition of those items. “The Sixth\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 393 Filed lo/29/2l Page5oflo\n\nAt the same time, three of the government’s other witnesses\nRn) 2o° law enforcement officers. Because the government\nfrequently atempts to elicit expert opinion testimony from law enforcement officers without\ndisclosing them as experts under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 or qualifying them as\nexperts under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2, and because law enforcement witnesses often offer\nopinion testimony about the defendant’s mental state and vouch for the truthfulness or bolster the\ncredibility of alleged victims in contravention of Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4, this Court should\ngrant this motion in /imine.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs expert opinion testimony at trial. It says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nIf a law enforcement officer gives testimony that “depend|[s], in whole or in part, on his\nspecialized training and experience,” the testimony is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule\n7o2 and not lay opinion testimony subject to Rule 7ol. United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol,\n2l6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We hold that the foundation requirements of Rule 7ol do not permit a law\nenforcement agent to testify to an opinion . . . if the agent’s reasoning process depended, in\nwhole or in part, on his specialized training and experience.”).\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page /7 of 84\n\n579, 588 (l993) (quoting Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U.S. l53, l69 (l988)).\n\nUnder Daubert, a district court must first determine whether an expert is qualified. See\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2 (“A witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience,\ntraining, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise .. . .”); United States v.\nKidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d 259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“At the first step of the Daubert inquiry, courts\nare instructed to consider the expert’s qualifications.”). Courts then must determine whether the\ntestimony “will be not only relevant, but reliable.” United States v. Romano, 794 F.3d 3l7, 33o\n(2d Cir. 2ol5); see Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597 (explaining that courts must ensure “that an expert’s\ntestimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand”). On reliability,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of reliability”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting Amorgianos v. Nat’l RR.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). “[T]hese criteria,” houever, “are not\nexhaustive.” Jd. Daubert itself, which “dealt with a scientific theory,” offered additional factors,\nsuch as whether the theory “‘has been subjected to peer review and publication,’” and the\n“knoun or potential rate of error.”” Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n593-94). And “there are many different kinds of experts, and many different kinds of expertise.”\nKumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l5o (l999). “[W]hether the specific expert\ntestimony focuses upon specialized observations, the specialized translation of those\nobservations into theory, a specialized theory itself, or the application of such a theory in a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo579o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 84\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (citing Fed.

Requena, 98o F.3d 3o, 47 (2d Cir. 2o2o). Thus\na district court may properly exercise its gatekeeping function without the “formality of a separate\nhearing[.]” Williams, 5o6 F.3d at l6l; see also United States v. Barnes, 4ll F. App’x 365, 37o\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order). “This is particularly true if, at the time that the expert testimony\nis presented to the jury, a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> basis for allouing the testimony is on the record.” Williams,\n5o6 F.3d at l6l (citing 4 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 7o2.o2 [2] (2d ed. 2oo6)).\n\nFinally, even if the expert testimony is reliable, it must also be relevant. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o Cr. 6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l). In\nthis context, the testimony must “concern maters that the average juror is not capable of\nunderstanding on his or her oun.” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l94 (2d Cir. 2oo8); see\nFaulkner v. Arista Records LLC, 46 F. Sup. 3d 365, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“Weighing whether the\nexpert testimony assists the trier of fact goes primarily to relevance.”).\n\nCourts have frequently admited expert testimony on the psychological relationship\nbetween perpetrators and victims of sex crimes. For instance, in United States v. Kidd, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 259 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), the Government gave notice of expert testimony on “the\npsychology of the pimp-prostitute relationship,” including concepts such as “trauma bonding.” Jd.\nat 263.

As the Second Circuit has\nexplained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only tend to prove the government’s case, and evidence\nthat adds context and dimension to the government’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.”\nId.; accord United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d l553, l56l (2d Cir. l99l). The Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly held that actions and statements are admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged,\nand are “not considered other crimes evidence under” Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), if (a) they\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are\n“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see also United\nStates v.

In those circumstances, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 84\nGovernment’s notice is remediated by this brief. This is ample notice of the possible Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence in this case. Indeed, the Rule only requires that the defense receive notice “before trial,”\nor even “during trial . . . for good cause.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3)(C).\n\nThe defense claims, without supporting authority, that Rule 4o4(b) requires heightened\nnotice that cannot be satisfied here without, essentially, a script of all of the proposed testimony at\ntrial accompanied by detailed expositions of the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Mot. 2 at 4-\n5). But the Government has provided the defense with marked exhibits and comprehensive Jencks\nAct materials of the single witness subject to this motion (approximately 4oo pages) “unusually\nearly” (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt. No. 353), along with a leter specifically highlighting the\nproffered evidence at trial. That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2ol9) (citing\nRodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty, Inc., 788 F.3d 3l, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol5)). Accordingly, the only judge\nin this District to consider a similar situation concluded that the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> in combination with the Government’s motion papers. See United States v.\nChandler, No. l9 Cr. 867 (PKC), 2o2l WL l85l996, at *2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l).\n\nThe defense vaguely asserts that it cannot perform an independent investigation into the\nRule 4o4(b) evidence due to the inadequacy of the Government’s notice. (Def. Mot. 2 at 5-6).\nThat conclusory assertion cannot support a motion to preclude the jury from hearing evidence of\nthe defendant’s guilt. The defense has not identified any specific way that they have been hampered\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive. See Kelly, 257 F.3d at l35.\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo585o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 72 of 84\nVI. The Court Should Deny the Defense Motions to Preclude the Government’s\nExhibits\n\nThe defense has filed several motions to preclude certain Government exhibits. (Def.\nMots. 7, 8, and l3). The Court should deny the defense authentication arguments without prejudice\nbecause the Government expects its witnesses will be able to authenticate the exhibits at trial\nbefore it offers them. The defendant’s arguments regarding relevance and Rule 4o3, houever, are\nmeritless, and the Court should deny them.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nIn general, “[t]o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of\nevidence, the proponent must produce evidence <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to support a finding that the item is what\nthe proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The Second Circuit has made clear that “the bar\nfor authentication of evidence is not particularly high.” United States v. El Gammal, 83l F. App’x\n539, 542 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). Rule 9ol is “satisfied if <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> proof has been introduced so that a reasonable\njuror could find in favor of authenticity or identification,” E/ Gammal, 83l F. App’x at 542\n(quoting United States v. Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4)), and such “proof of\nauthentication may be direct or circumstantial,” United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (citations and internal quotation marks omited).\n\nFor instance, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary\norder), the defendant challenged the authenticity of “handwriten leters that were found in a USB\ndrive that was handed to an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” J/d. at\n24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge. “Although the Government did not present\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 73 of 84\nevidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the seizure of the USB drive, Federal Rule of\nEvidence 9ol(b)(4) permits authentication based on ‘[t]he appearance, contents, substance,\ninternal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the\ncircumstances.’” /d. (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Evid 9ol(b)(4)). Witness testimony\nabout the content of the leters was “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to pass the relatively lou bar for authentication of\nevidence,” and “any remaining questions as to the reliability of the leters go to their evidentiary\nweight, not their admissibility.” /d. at 24-25.\n\nSimilarly, although physical evidence may be authenticated through a chain of custody,\n“any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and not on its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Stuckey, No. o6 Cr. 339 (RPP), 2oo7 WL 2962594, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo7) (citing United States v. Morrison, l53 F.3d 34, 57 (2d Cir. l998)); see also United States v.\nHemmings, 482 F. App’x 64o, 643 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (summary order) (similar). “Evidence should\nbe excluded on a motion in limine only when the evidence is clearly inadmissible on all potential\ngrounds.” United States v. Cilins, No. l3 CR. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol4 WL l734l4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan.\nl5, 2ol4) (citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defense’s challenges to the Government’s exhibits largely turn on the Government’s\nability to authenticate them. Those arguments are premature. At trial, the Government expects\nthat witnesses familiar with the exhibits will testify that the items are what the Government claims\nthey are. The defendant is not entitled to a preview of the Government’s case-in-chief at this\njuncture.\n\n72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 74 of 84\n\nFirst, the defendant moves to exclude Government Exhibit 52, which it says was obtained\nby the Government “as part of discovery in Guiffre v. Maxwell civil litigation . . . with no\nexplanation about its origin.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). The defendant misidentifies the exhibit.\nGovernment Exhibit 52 is a physical contact book belonging to the defendant. The records\natached by the defense as Exhibit l appear to be a scan of Government Exhibit 52 that was\nproduced in discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell. But the Government will not offer that scan at trial.\nIt will offer the physical book itself, along with scans taken by the Government of the physical\nbook. A witness with personal knouledge of the physical book is expected to testify to its\nauthenticity.\n\nThe defendant takes issue with the history of the Government’s acquisition of Government\nExhibit 52. The defendant is correct that the Government came into custody of this exhibit after a\nformer employee of Jeffrey Epstein atempted to sell it to a civil lawyer suing Epstein. (/d.). The\ndefense calls this “particularly troubling” (Def. Mot. 7 at 2), but that argument is misplaced. Hou\nthe Government acquired the exhibit goes, if anything, to its weight and not its admissibility. Ifa\nwitness can identify the exhibit based on its contents, that is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to pass the relatively lou\nbar for authentication of evidence.” See Al Farekh, 8lo F.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006002.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 47 of 52\nprejudice because the [witness's] choice of language implied that he and the prosecution believed\nthe complainant's testimony.\" Jd.\n\nFor these and the previously stated reasons, Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to order that the\nparties, the witnesses, and the Court use individuals’ names in the presence of the jury.\nXIU.

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo7\nIntoxication\nAs a prerequisite for this pathway, the consumption of intoxicating sub-\nstances must have led to distortions in information processing. There\nare currently many drugs that are used by sexual assault perpetrators to\nincapacitate victims (Horvath & Broun, 2oo5). These drugs may include\nRohypnol (e.g., “roofies”) and amphetamines, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or\nantihistamines. Other drugs, such as gamma hydroxybutyrate, cocaine, and\nketamine have also been indicated in drug-assisted sexual assault cases (see\nHorvath & Broun, 2oo5; Hindmarch & Brinkmann, l999). In a forensic case,\nit is important to determine whether the accuser voluntarily or involuntarily\nconsumed drugs. If the drugs were not voluntarily consumed, it is likely that\nthe individual who drugged the claimant had premeditated plans to control\nthe claimant (Welner, 2ool), regardless of whether the perpetrator assaulted\nthe claimant.\n\nThough consent issues are clearly important considerations when\ndetermining the nature of sexual behaviors while intoxicated, they are super-\nfluous considerations in this pathway. Under most state laws, a person\ncannot legally consent to sexual activity while intoxicated (Davis & Loftus,\n2oo8). In fact, even if consent to engage in sexual activity is ex ante (before\nthe first dose of the intoxicating substance), the act of engaging in sex-\nual activity while intoxicated can later be determined to be non-consensual\nsexual activity and is often <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence to convict someone of rape.\nTherefore, issues of consent, for these reasons, will not be discussed in the\ncontext of this pathway.\n\nA key issue in this pathway is whether the claimant believes that he\nor she was sexually assaulted while under the influence of intoxicating sub-\nstances, when in reality no sexual activity took place or activity occurred very\ndifferent from what she is nou claiming (e.g., she claimed penetration when\nno penetration occurred). Some drugs, when consumed at <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> levels,\nmay cause impairments in information processing—sensation, perception,\nstorage, or retrieval. Substances knoun to cause these effects are alco-\nhol, sedatives/hypnotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, soporifics), and anxiolytics\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). High doses of alcohol have been\nshoun to inhibit memory in humans and animals (Bisby, Leitz, Morgan, &\nCurran, 2olo; Crego et al., 2oo9; Spineta et al., 2oo8). Moreover, upon ceas-\ning to use these drugs, withdrawal symptoms may include delirium and\npsychotic disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; Lin, Heacock, &\nFogel, in press)—two additional pathways to false allegations that will be\ndiscussed later in this paper.\n\nThe information-processing errors of the intoxicating substances men-\ntioned above may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while\na person was intoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 29\nll6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nbecause the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions\nfrom filing the allegation.\n\nStudies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID\nare most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Broun, Stein, &\nTurk, l995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-\nmon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where\npeer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often\nthe focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be\nchallenging in this population as it may be unclear whether individuals have\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> knouledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent\n(Jjoyce, 2oo3). For instance, in some sexual assault cases, individuals with\nID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the\nassault. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this population\nwould be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase\ntheir potential for coercion and. exploitation.\n\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without\nID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the\nlegal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with\nmoderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating\nabout the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).\nAhgrim-Delzell and Dudley’s (2ool) findings indicate that communications\nskills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims with mild\nID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to\nfile sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties\nwith memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals\nwith ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3) who have been shoun to have poorer\nmemory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to\nfill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, l993).\nHouever, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;\nrather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely\nto provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the\nevent (Ternes & Yuille, 2oo8). In other words, individuals with ID are less\nlikely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Haton, l999).\n\nSpecific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer\nmemory, may account for inaccurate reporting of events (Gudjonsson &\nJoyce, 2oll). Individuals with ID have been shoun to be significantly more\nsuggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3; Everington &\nFulero, l999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,\nl993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability\namong individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency\ntouard accepting information communicated by others and incorporating\nthis information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-\ndisposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is\npresented (Chronbach, l946).

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming.

But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v.

Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b). See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l57-l69.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo664l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006643.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7of2l\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “‘subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice’”’)).

The Government also\nprovided the defense with Jencks Act materials for all trial witnesses that same day, including\ndetailed notes and reports of the Government’s interviews of the witness referenced in the leter.\n\nThe defendant nou moves to exclude this evidence, arguing, among other things, that the\nGovernment has not provided <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice of the evidence it intends to offer at trial under Rule\n4o4(b).

The Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly held that actions and statements are admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged,\nand are “not considered other crimes evidence under” Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), if (a) they\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are\n“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see also United\nStates v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 9o, 93-94\n(2d Cir. 2oo3). In those circumstances, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6742\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 84\nGovernment’s notice is remediated by this brief. This is ample notice of the possible Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence in this case. Indeed, the Rule only requires that the defense receive notice “before trial,”\nor even “during trial . . . for good cause.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3)(C).\n\nThe defense claims, without supporting authority, that Rule 4o4(b) requires heightened\nnotice that cannot be satisfied here without, essentially, a script of all of the proposed testimony at\ntrial accompanied by detailed expositions of the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Mot. 2 at 4-\n5). But the Government has provided the defense with marked exhibits and comprehensive Jencks\nAct materials of the single witness subject to this motion (approximately 4oo pages) “unusually\nearly” (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt. No. 353), along with a leter specifically highlighting the\nproffered evidence at trial. That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2ol9) (citing\nRodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty, Inc., 788 F.3d 3l, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol5)). Accordingly, the only judge\nin this District to consider a similar situation concluded that the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> in combination with the Government’s motion papers. See United States v.\nChandler, No. l9 Cr. 867 (PKC), 2o2l WL l85l996, at *2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l).\n\nThe defense vaguely asserts that it cannot perform an independent investigation into the\nRule 4o4(b) evidence due to the inadequacy of the Government’s notice. (Def. Mot. 2 at 5-6).\nThat conclusory assertion cannot support a motion to preclude the jury from hearing evidence of\nthe defendant’s guilt. The defense has not identified any specific way that they have been hampered\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive. See Kelly, 257 F.3d at l35.\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6775\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006780.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 72 of 84\nVI. The Court Should Deny the Defense Motions to Preclude the Government’s\nExhibits\n\nThe defense has filed several motions to preclude certain Government exhibits. (Def.\nMots. 7, 8, and l3). The Court should deny the defense authentication arguments without prejudice\nbecause the Government expects its witnesses will be able to authenticate the exhibits at trial\nbefore it offers them. The defendant’s arguments regarding relevance and Rule 4o3, houever, are\nmeritless, and the Court should deny them.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nIn general, “[t]o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of\nevidence, the proponent must produce evidence <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to support a finding that the item is what\nthe proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The Second Circuit has made clear that “the bar\nfor authentication of evidence is not particularly high.” United States v. El Gammal, 83l F. App’x\n539, 542 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). Rule 9ol is “satisfied if <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> proof has been introduced so that a reasonable\njuror could find in favor of authenticity or identification,” E/ Gammal, 83l F. App’x at 542\n(quoting United States v. Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4)), and such “proof of\nauthentication may be direct or circumstantial,” United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (citations and internal quotation marks omited).\n\nFor instance, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary\norder), the defendant challenged the authenticity of “handwriten leters that were found in a USB\ndrive that was handed to an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” J/d. at\n24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge. “Although the Government did not present\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo678o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006781.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 73 of 84\nevidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the seizure of the USB drive, Federal Rule of\nEvidence 9ol(b)(4) permits authentication based on ‘[t]he appearance, contents, substance,\ninternal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the\ncircumstances.’” /d. (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Evid 9ol(b)(4)). Witness testimony\nabout the content of the leters was “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to pass the relatively lou bar for authentication of\nevidence,” and “any remaining questions as to the reliability of the leters go to their evidentiary\nweight, not their admissibility.” /d. at 24-25.\n\nSimilarly, although physical evidence may be authenticated through a chain of custody,\n“any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and not on its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Stuckey, No. o6 Cr. 339 (RPP), 2oo7 WL 2962594, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo7) (citing United States v. Morrison, l53 F.3d 34, 57 (2d Cir. l998)); see also United States v.\nHemmings, 482 F. App’x 64o, 643 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (summary order) (similar). “Evidence should\nbe excluded on a motion in limine only when the evidence is clearly inadmissible on all potential\ngrounds.” United States v. Cilins, No. l3 CR. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol4 WL l734l4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan.\nl5, 2ol4) (citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defense’s challenges to the Government’s exhibits largely turn on the Government’s\nability to authenticate them. Those arguments are premature. At trial, the Government expects\nthat witnesses familiar with the exhibits will testify that the items are what the Government claims\nthey are. The defendant is not entitled to a preview of the Government’s case-in-chief at this\njuncture.\n\n72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo678l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006782.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 74 of 84\n\nFirst, the defendant moves to exclude Government Exhibit 52, which it says was obtained\nby the Government “as part of discovery in Guiffre v. Maxwell civil litigation . . . with no\nexplanation about its origin.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). The defendant misidentifies the exhibit.\nGovernment Exhibit 52 is a physical contact book belonging to the defendant. The records\natached by the defense as Exhibit l appear to be a scan of Government Exhibit 52 that was\nproduced in discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell. But the Government will not offer that scan at trial.\nIt will offer the physical book itself, along with scans taken by the Government of the physical\nbook. A witness with personal knouledge of the physical book is expected to testify to its\nauthenticity.\n\nThe defendant takes issue with the history of the Government’s acquisition of Government\nExhibit 52. The defendant is correct that the Government came into custody of this exhibit after a\nformer employee of Jeffrey Epstein atempted to sell it to a civil lawyer suing Epstein. (/d.). The\ndefense calls this “particularly troubling” (Def. Mot. 7 at 2), but that argument is misplaced. Hou\nthe Government acquired the exhibit goes, if anything, to its weight and not its admissibility. Ifa\nwitness can identify the exhibit based on its contents, that is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to pass the relatively lou\nbar for authentication of evidence.” See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the contents of Government Exhibit 52 are hearsay\nbecause they are not a business record. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4-6). The exhibit is separately admissible\nnot for the truth of the maters asserted therein (such as the accuracy of the contact information for\nvictims), but to establish that the defendant kept contact information for relevant individuals at\ntrial, including victims. The exhibit has evidentiary value in shouing that the defendant\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6782\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 75 of 84\nmaintained a contact book containing what purports to be this list of names and associated contact\ninformation.\n\nSecond, the defendant moves to preclude any items seized during the 2oo5 search of\nEpstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def. Mot. 8 at 3-5). The defense further speculates that the Government intends to offer these\nexhibits without any testimony about their authenticity, in part because the original custodian—\nDetective Recarey—is dead. (/d. at 4-5). The defense is mistaken. The Government intends to\ncall live witnesses to establish the authenticity of the evidence at trial.'®\n\nThird, the defendant argues that the photographs in Government Exhibit 25l and 288 are\nirrelevant. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2). These photographs, [ine\n| | were displayed in Epstein’s home. ee\neee\neee\neee\n'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was writen by both Detective Recarey\nand another witness who is expected to testify at trial. The exhibit is primarily marked for\nidentification, although portions of that document may be offered as a past recollection recorded\nby that other witness. See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(5). The Government will not offer statements from\nDetective Recarey.\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006927.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 47 of 52\nprejudice because the [witness's] choice of language implied that he and the prosecution believed\nthe complainant's testimony.\" Jd.\n\nFor these and the previously stated reasons, Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to order that the\nparties, the witnesses, and the Court use individuals’ names in the presence of the jury.\nXIU. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF GOVERNMENT\nEXHIBITS 52, 25l, 288, 294, 3l3, 6o6 AND THE SEARCH OF EL BRILLO WAY\nA. The Court Should Exclude the Challenged Government Exhibits\nRule 9ol(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that “[t]he requirement\nof authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by\nevidence <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to support a finding that the mater in question is what its proponent\nclaims.” See also Rickets v. City of Hartford, 74 F.3d l397, l4o9 (2d Cir.l996); United States v.\nSliker, 75l F.2d 477, 496-5oo (2d Cir.l984) (discussing the interaction between\nFed.R.Evid. lo4 and 9ol). “In order for a piece of evidence to be of probative value, there must\nbe proof that it is what its proponent says it is. The requirement of authentication is thus a\ncondition precedent to admiting evidence.” United States v. Sliker, 75l F.2d 477, 497 (2d Cir.\nl984). A motion in limine to preclude evidence calls on the \"[C]ourt to make a preliminary\ndetermination on the admissibility of evidence under Rule lo4 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence.” Highland Capital Mgmt., L.P. v.

Employee-l also\nrecognizes several of the contacts listed in Government Exhibit 52 as friends of the defendant and\nEpstein. The entries include, among others, the defendant’s family members. See GX 52E.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nA. Authenticity\n\nAs a general mater, “an item of evidence must ‘be authenticated through introduction of\nevidence <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to warrant a finding that the item is what the proponent says it is.”” United\nStates v. Corley, 679 F. App’x l, 4 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (summary order) (quoting Crawford v. Tribeca\nLending Corp., 8l5 F.3d l2l, l26 (2d Cir. 2ol6)). “Under Rule 9ol of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence, ‘[t]he requirement of authentication . . . as a condition precedent to admissibility is\nsatisfied by evidence <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to support a finding that the mater in question is what its proponent\nclaims.’” United States v. Jackson, 345 F.3d 59, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a)).\n\nThis bar for authentication “is ‘not particularly high.’” United States v. Bout, 65l F. App’x\n62, 63-64 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page4of8\nPage 4\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). To meet this burden, the Government need only introduce “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> proof. . .\nso that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.” United States v.\nTin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (internal quotation marks omited). For “a document\natributed to the defendant, the prosecution need only provide a rational basis from which the jury\ncould infer that the document did, in fact, belong to [her].” United States v. Osarenkhoe, 439 F.\nApp’x 66, 69 (2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order) (internal quotation marks and citation omited).\n\nEvidence of authenticity “may be direct or circumstantial, and the later category may\ninclude distinctive characteristics of the document itself.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,\n922 F.2d 934, 957 (2d Cir. l99o); Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 37. Indeed, Rule 9ol contemplates\nmultiple avenues through which a proponent may authenticate evidence. For example, the\nproponent may offer “[t]estimony that an item is what it is claimed to be,” or may offer evidence\nof “[t]he appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of\nthe item, taken together with all the circumstances.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(l) and (4).\n\nHere, the testimony of Employee-l establishes the authenticity of Government Exhibit 52.\nIn particular, the fact that Employee-l recognizes this exhibit and can identify it as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its “distinctive characteristics” is all that Rule 9ol requires. Indeed, the\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the admission of evidence under similar circumstances, where, as\nhere, the Government does not offer evidence at trial about hou the exhibit came into the\nGovernment’s possession. In United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F.

To the extent the defense disputes Employee-l’s testimony, or takes issue\nwith the circumstances under which Government Exhibit 52 came into the Government’s\npossession,* those arguments are for the jury. The anticipated testimony satisfies Rule 9ol, and\nthe evidence should be admited.\n\n3 Tt is a mater of public record that in 2oo9, an employee of Jeffrey Epstein, Alfredo Rodriguez,\natempted to sell Government Exhibit 52 to a plaintiffs atorney.

Rodriguez has stated that he took the book from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nduring his employment for Epstein from 2oo4 to early 2oo5. Government Exhibit 52 has remained\nin the possession of the FBI since that time. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and\nacknouledged that he was obligated to turn this evidence over to the FBI years earlier, when he\nwas interviewed during the course of the FBI’s investigation of Epstein.

For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time.

First, I must\n\nl4 determine whether the pretrial identification procedures were\nl5 unduly suggestive. Some examples of suggestive procedures\n\nl6 include using a very small number of photographs, making\n\nl7 suggestive comments, or the display of the accused in a way\n\nl8 that so stood out from all other photographs to suggest to an\nl9 identifying eyewitness that the person was more likely to be\n2o the culprit. See, United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369,\n2l (2d Cir. l992).\n22 Looking at the photo array, neither the photos used or\n23 the procedure itself was unduly suggestive.

The Court ordered the Government to\nrespond in particular to the defendant’s argument that “Employee-l cannot authenticate\nGovernment Exhibit 52 because Mr. Rodriguez, a former employee, purportedly removed the\ndocument from the property before Employee-l began working for Mr. Epstein.” (/d.)\n\nThe Second Circuit has “often commented that the bar for authentication of evidence is not\nparticularly high.” United States v.

(internal quotation marks omited); see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘reasonable likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v.

Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (emphases in\noriginal).\n\nThe defendant’s argument suggests that Government Exhibit 52 is unique in a way\nunsupported by the evidence. Government Exhibit 52 is a bound, sewn, typed address book with\na particular cover. Employee-l will testify that, based on its appearance, contents, and distinctive\ncharacteristics, it appears to be a copy of the defendant’s address book. She will also testify that\nother bound, sewn, typed copies of the same address book with the same cover were located in\nspecific places in Epstein’s Palm Beach house, as was the operating practice of Epstein’s house.\nThat testimony is corroborated by Government Exhibit 6o6, the household manual, which states\nthat “A copy of Mr Epstein and Ms Maxwell’s telephone directories must be placed to the right of\neach telephone (except for the Guestrooms).” (GX 6o6 at 7). And it is corroborated by Mr.\nRodriguez himself, whose counsel said at sentencing in his case that the book he possessed was “a\ncopy of the book, of which there were many copies, and Mr. Rodriguez had one as Mr. Epstein’s\nhouse man.” Sent.

Dr. Dietz’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government agrees that Dr. Dietz is qualified to offer expert opinion testimony under\nRule 7o2. Even so, the government hopes to limit his testimony by claiming that six categories of\nhis proposed opinions are either unreliable, irrelevant, or invade the province of the jury.\n\nThe government, though, is trying to have it both ways, by eliciting testimony from its\nexpert Dr. Rocchio while unfairly precluding Ms. Maxwell from responding. The government\nalso seeks to foreclose Dr. Dietz from offering opinions that are independently relevant to this\ncase, irrespective of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. To make its case, the government engages in the\ntime-honored practice of mischaracterizing a defendant’s position and then responding to the\nstrawman.\n\nThis Court should reject the government’s efforts, which, if successful, will deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to present a complete defense and to confront and cross-\nexamine her accusers.

Response to Dr. Rocchio’s Proposed Testimony.\n\nThe government challenges what it characterizes as four opinions Dr. Dietz might offer in\nresponse to testimony from Dr. Rocchio.! As explained belou, though, Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nresponsive to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony in more than the four narrou ways identified by the\ngovernment. In addition, much of his proposed testimony has independent relevance. In any\nevent, none of the government’s challenges is persuasive.\n\nFirst, the government challenges Dr. Dietz’s proposed testimony (l) that Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinion on grooming “carries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of\n‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,” and that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or\nenticing sexualized massages for herself,” but instead that she allegedly “recruited and groomed\nminors to provide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein.” Mot. at lo. The government says these\nthree opinions are inadmissible “legal” conclusions suitable only for a Daubert hearing and not\nfor the jury trial.\n\nIt is perfectly appropriate for Dr. Dietz to opine that Dr. Rocchio’s definition of\n“srooming” risks “imputing motive and intent” to the defendant because that is precisely why\nthere is no setled, clinical definition of grooming, which the government has conceded is a\nproper subject of Dr. Dietz’s expert opinions. Supra Note l; Ex. l, p 3-4. Surely Dr. Dietz can\ninform the jury why the science does not support Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming.\n\nDr. Dietz will not himself (and Dr. Rocchio cannot herself) ascribe motive or intent to\nMs. Maxwell, nor will he testify that the jury lacks <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence to ascribe motive and\n\n' The government agrees Dr. Dietz can inform the jury that Dr. Rocchio is wrong to\nsuggest that grooming has a setled definition.

This testimony is patently relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge and intent and to the\nconspiracy counts. If this “compartmentalization” prevented Ms. Maxwell from having the\nrequired knouledge or intent (an ultimate issue for the jury to decide, on which Dr. Dietz will\nnot opine), then she will be not guilty. The government after all intends to ask the Court to\ninstruct the jury on “willful blindness.” The jury should have the benefit of a scientific\nunderstanding of the manner in which a skilled manipulator could have eluded exposure to those\naround him.\n\nThe government obviously disagrees with Dr. Dietz in his evaluation of Mr. Epstein. But\njust because the government has a different view of the facts does not mean Dr. Dietz’s\ntestimony is inadmissible. Rule 7o2’s emphasis on “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> facts or data” does not “authorize\na trial court to exclude an expert’s testimony on the ground” that the government “believes one\nversion of the facts and not the other.” See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo\nAmendments.\n\nThe government’s second objection is easily addressed. The point of the testimony is not\nto suggest jury nullification, which would be improper as defense counsel and Dr. Dietz well\nknou. Mot. at l7. The testimony is relevant, as explained above. In any case, if the Court is\nconcemed about any potential for Dr. Dietz’s testimony to engender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell,\nthe Court can give a limiting instruction. That limiting instruction would be in addition to the\nCourt’s writen instructions, which already will instruct the jury not to decide the case based on\nsympathy or bias. Malletier v. Dooney & Bourke, Inc., 525 F. Supp. 2d 558, 57l (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo7) (“This Court has routinely relied upon limiting instructions to remind the jury of its role\nand of the limits of expert testimony and clarify the extent of their consideration of such\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page l6 of 28\npatients are telling the truth when they claim to have been abused. See Ex. l, p 7 (“Studies\nconcerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by\nDr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and are also otherwise\nrelevant here.”). Because, in Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio does not make <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nallouance for the potential that her patients are not telling the truth, the jury is entitled to knou\nhou and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,\nMot. at 9, “the jury, and not the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views of\ndifferent experts.” Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l73 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)\n(quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l53 (l999)).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are directly relevant to evaluate the nature and timing of\nthe disclosures by the alleged victims in this case. As Dr. Rocchio admited during her testimony\nat her Daubert hearing, there are numerous reasons why a report of sexual assault might not\nsurface immediately, including the various pathways to a false allegation identified by Dr. Dietz.\nEx. 2, p l53-54.\n\nNor are Dr. Dietz’s opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at 2o-2l. First,\nDr. Rocchio essentially admited they were reliable during her testimony. Ex. 2, p l53-54.\n\nSecond, if Dr. Dietz’s reliance on the Engle and O’Donohue article weren’t enough\n(which it is), Dr. Dietz will testify as well based on his extensive clinical experience. In his oun\npractice, he has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false allegations identified by\nEngle & O’Donohue. Dr. Dietz thus could reliably offer these opinions even if the absence of the\narticle. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments.

Burbran, No. l8-CV-4698 (AJN), 2o2l WL 4224727, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. l6, 2o2l) (quotation omited). In turn, under Rule 9ol(a), “To satisfy the\nrequirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce\nevidence <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol(a). If authenticated, the proponent of the evidence must also prove that the evidence is\nrelevant and not unfairly prejudicial or misleading. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o2, 4o3.\n\n“A picture may .. . be inadmissible, although technically accurate, because it portrays a\nscene that is materially different from a scene that is relevant to one of the issues at trial.” United\nStates v. Stearns, 55o F.2d ll67, ll7o (9th Cir. l977). And when a “photograph fails to portray\nthe relevant facts with complete accuracy, such as if changed conditions have occurred, it may be\nmisleading.” § 2l5. Photographs, 2 McCormick on Evid. § 2l5 (8th ed.).’\n\nThe government has not met its burden of proof here. The charged conspiracy ended in\n2oo4. And Jane claims she was at Mr. Epstein’s New York apartment in l994 or l995 or l996.\n\n* The government relies on just two cases to support its argument: United States v.\nCertified Env. Services, Inc., 753 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2ol4) and United States v. Roux, 7l5 F.3d\nlol9 (7th Cir. 2ol3). Gov. Leter at 2. Neither case addresses photographs of real or personal\nproperty, and neither responds to this Court’s concerns about the passage of time and changed\ncircumstances.\n\nCertified Environmental Services dealt with emails and Code Rule guidance, 753 F.3d at\n89-9l, and Roux addressed other act evidence, 7l5 F.3d at lo27. Both cases addressed evidence\nrelevant to the defendant’s state of mind. Most importantly, the existence of the evidence is what\nmade it relevant, and no one disputed authentication.

For the reasons set forth belou, the record at trial\nestablishes that Government Exhibit 52 is authentic. Accordingly, excerpts of Government Exhibit\n52 should be admited.\n\nl.

Discussion\n\nThe Government has laid <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> foundation for admission of Government Exhibit 52\nthrough three sources: (l) the testimony of Juan Alessi, (2) the admission of Government Exhibit\n6o6 (the household manual), and (3) evidence corroborating the fact that the contact book reflects\nthe contact information of multiple people who knew the defendant and Epstein. Taken together,\nthis evidence is more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for a reasonable juror to conclude that the contact book is in\nfact a contact book from the Palm Beach house.\n\nFirst, Alessi personally examined Government Exhibit 52 and recognized it. Tr. at 85o.\nHe said it is the same “type of book,” and appeared to be one of the “directories of Ms. Maxwell\nand Mr. Epstein.” /d. He said it had the “same cover,” had the “same binding,” and had layout\nthat was “exactly as the books” that he recalled. (/d. at 85l). Although the books he saw were\nthicker and had larger font, the “format was the same.” (/d. at 85l-52).\n\nAs to the contents of the book, Alessi testified that he saw “many, many, many, many\nnames” in Government Exhibit 52 that were he recognized from the book he saw when he worked\nfor Epstein. (/d. at 85l). He specifically recognized entries in the list for massage in Palm Beach,\nwhich is copied in Government Exhibit 52-G. (/d.)\n\nAlthough Alessi only worked in the Palm Beach house until the end of 2oo2, he explained\nthat the practice during his twelve years that he worked for Epstein was to print new directories\ntwice a year.

He also determined that Government Exhibit 52 is a copy of a book from\nsometime after he was employed because his name was not in the book, whereas his contact\ninformation and it was “originally . . . in the information for Palm Beach information of the house.”\nId. at 853.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Government seeks to admit what has been identified as Government Exhibit 52\n(“GX 52”), and submit to the jury a redacted version of GX 52. The Defense objects to the\nadmission of GX 52 on authentication and hearsay grounds.' The admissibility of the exhibit has\nbeen the subject of pretrial motion in /imine briefing and extensive supplemental briefing. See\nDkt. Nos. 39o, 397, 398, 457, 476, 49o. This includes supplemental briefing received on\nDecember 8, 2o2l, after the authenticating witness, Mr. Juan Alessi, underwent direct\nexamination by the Government and voir dire by the Defense. The Court reserved ruling on the\nexhibit, pending what was anticipated to be additional testimony. Trial Tr. at 876. The Court\nnou overrules the Defense’s objections.\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 9ol provides that to properly authenticate or identify an item of\nevidence, “the proponent must produce evidence <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to support a finding that the item is\nwhat the proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The bar for authentication is “not\n! The Defense previously agreed that if GX 52 is admited, it will stipulate that Government Exhibits 52A, 52D,\n52E, 52F, 52G, and 52H are true and correct photocopies of five pages from GX 52.

Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo8). It does not\nrequire ruling out “all possibilities inconsistent with authenticity,” or “prov[ing] beyond any\ndoubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.” United States v. Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658\n(2d Cir. 2ool). Rather, all that is required is “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> proof... so that a reasonable juror could\nfind in favor of authenticity or identification.” Jd. This “minimal” standard can be satisfied by\nthe “testimony of a witness with knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be.” United\nStates v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7). Once this “minimal” standard is met, “the\nother party then remains free to challenge the reliability of the evidence, to minimize its\nimportance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning, but these and similar other\nchallenges go to the weight of the evidence—not to its admissibility.” United States v. Tin Yat\nChin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 8ol defines “hearsay” as ‘“‘a statement that a party offers in\nevidence to prove the truth of the mater asserted in the statement.” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(c)(2).\n\nIl. ANALYSIS\n\nThe Court first addresses authentication under Rule 9ol and concludes that Mr. Alessi’s\ntestimony is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to meet this Rule’s standard. Mr. Alessi testified that he worked in the\nPalm Beach residence from l99o to December 2oo2. Trial Tr. at 778. His job required him to\nspend a significant amount of time in the residence. /d. at 779-8o. Based on his years working\nat the residence, he recalled that Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell maintained telephone directories\nand that GX 52 was a version of those directories.\n\nHe first testified about the function of the telephone directories in the Palm Beach\nresidence, and that he recalled first seeing the directories in l995 or l996. Id. at 849. He\ntestified where in the home the directories were kept—“in the kitchen desk,” “Ms. Maxwell’s\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nexhibit and that he recognized “many, many, many, many names” amongst the entries, including\nsome of the entries that were for “massage in Palm Beach.” /d. at 85l.\n\nThe Defense first objects that Mr. Alessi has no personal knouledge about the creation of\nthis particular directory and is thus incapable of authenticating the exhibit. Mr. Alessi\nacknouledged that GX 52 was a different version than the directories he was familiar with\nbecause GX 52 was not as thick as those versions, and his name and his wife’s name were in the\nversion he observed, but neither his name nor his wife’s name was in GX 52. Id. at 853, 865.\nBut a document may be admited under 9ol(b)(4) even when no witness saw the creation of the\ndocument or the particular copy admited at trial.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o), the court\naffirmed the district court’s authentication of handwriten leters even though no testifying\nwitness confirmed they had previously examined the leters. Instead, testimony that the\n“appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics” of the\nleters were consistent with other leters previously observed was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy Rule 9ol.\nId. at 24-25. Similarly, in Tin Yat Chin, the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of copies of\ncredit card receipts despite uncertainty about who signed the receipts and when. 37l F.3d at 38;\nsee also United States v. Gordon, 634 F.2d 639, 643-44 (lst Cir. l98o) (referring to\nauthenticated documents as “parallel documents” with distinctive characteristics such as being\nprinted on the “same stationary,” to “indicate a common authorship”). Finally, cases have\nalloued a witness to authenticate emails under Rule 9ol(b)(4), even if they were not a recipient\nof the specific email being admited, when the witness had a history and familiarity with the\ndefendant’s email communication tendencies. See, e.g., United States v. Bertram, 259 F. Supp.\n3d 638 (E.D. Ky. 2ol7); see also United States v. Gasperini, l6-CR-44l (NGG), 2ol7 WL\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page5of8\n3l4o366, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“The Court is unaware of any authority that authentication of\nemails can only come through a witness with direct knouledge of the drafting, and Defendant\nprovides none.”).\n\nConcluding that Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently authenticates GX 52 follous this\nwell-tread path. Mr. Alessi’s testimony established an intimate familiarity with the distinctive\ndirectories used in the Palm Beach household over many years and during the time period of the\ncharged conspiracy. He testified that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of\nbinding, cover, and information. This testimony of the appearance, content, substance, and other\ndistinctive characteristics of the exhibit is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy Rule 9ol.”\n\nThe Defense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\nSee Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38. For example, Mr. Alessi was crossed on voir dire that he did\nnot have personal knouledge about the creation of GX 52 or hou the exhibit had been\nmaintained since it was allegedly removed from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknouledged\nthat he would not knou whether GX 52 had been altered in some way, such as whether pages\nhad been added or whether it had been rebound. Nor could he explain the addition of Post-It\nnotes and other pencil markings in the otherwise type-face book. Trial Tr. at 872-75. But it is\nwell setled that “any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and\nnot on its admissibility.” United States v. Stuckey, No. o6 Cr. 339 (RPP), 2oo7 WL 2962594, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (citing United States v. Morrison, l53 F.3d 34, 57 (2d Cir. l998)). Thus,\narguments as to the Government’s possession of the document or hou it has been maintained do\nnot go to authentication. See Al Farekh, 8lo F.

The defendant thereby becomes a knouing and willing participant in the\n22 unlawful agreement—that is to say, she becomes a conspirator.\n\n48\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008757.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 5l of 83\n\nl New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55; (3) In or about l996, Maxwell provided Annie with an\n\n2 unsolicited massage in New Mexico, during which Annie was topless; (4) Between in or about\n\n3 2ool and in or about 2oo2, when Carolyn was under the age of l7, Maxwell and Epstein invited\n\n4 Carolyn to travel from Florida to a place outside of Florida with Epstein.\n\n5 With respect to the overt acts for Count Five, the Indictment alleges as follous: (l)\n\n6 Between in or about 2ool and in or about 2oo4, Epstein and Maxwell recruited Carolyn to\n\n7 engage in sex acts with Epstein at the Palm Beach Residence, after which Epstein and, at times,\n\n8 Maxwell provided Carolyn with hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter.

For the reasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court, in the\nalternative, to:\n\nl. Vacate her convictions as to the Mann Act counts (Counts One through Four)\n\nand grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive amendment/variance from the allegations in the S2 Indictment\n(the “Indictment’”).\n\n2.

The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008935.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Pagell of 37\n\nMR. ROHRBACH: Annie only relates to the conspiracy counts, at least as to\n\nthese Mann Act charges, and the jury is going to be instructed here that the\n\nrelevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the New York offense. So\n\nagain, there’s no risk that the jury will think that the sexual contact that happened\n\nin New Mexico is something that on its oun is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to shou the illegal\n\nsexual activity required by the statute.\nTr. 2775:2-9. With regard to Jane’s testimony, the government reiterated the same point:\n\nMR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, these instructions do not put before the jury any\n\nviolation of any New Mexico offense whatsoever above or belou the age of\n\nconsent, so I think there’s no risk that the jury is going to convict the defendant\n\nbased on their concerns about a violation of a New York offense.\nTr. 2776:5-lo. The Court agreed with the government and declined to include the requested\ninstructions. Tr. 2777:l2-25.\n\nps The Jury Note\n\nDuring their deliberations, the jury sent a note inquiring about the proper basis to convict\nunder Count Four of the Indictment (the substantive transportation count) (the “Jury Note” or the\nNote”). The Jury Note read as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\nCourt Exhibit #l5 (Dkt. 593 at 23). The defense argued that the Note indicated that the jury was\nalready contemplating convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse in New Mexico, which was not a violation of New York law, and that their question\nfocused on whether Ms. Maxwell’s help planning Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nassuming they found she gave any, was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\nTr. 3l28:6-3l4o:l8. The Court disagreed and did not offer any clarifying instructions, and\nsimply referred the jury to the charge for the second element of Count Four.

To establish a constructive amendment, the defendant must shou that the\nevidence and jury instructions created a substantial likelihood that she was convicted for\n“behavior entirely separate from that identified in the indictment.” /d. (cleaned up).\n\nThe fundamental principle of constructive amendment is clear: ““When the trial evidence\nor the jury charge operates to ‘broaden [ | the possible bases for conviction from that which\nappeared in the indictment,’ the indictment has been constructively amended.” United States v.\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (quoting United States v. Miller, 47l U.S. l3o, l38\n(l985) (emphasis omited)).\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up). A defendant\nalleging variance must shou “substantial prejudice” to warrant reversal. /d.

(cleaned up).\n\nC. The “Core of Criminality” of the Mann Act Counts Was a Scheme to Entice\n\nor Cause Underaged Girls to Travel to New York with an Intent to Violate\nNew York Law.\n\nThere can be no serious dispute that the “core of criminality” of the Mann Act offenses\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment was a scheme by Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they would\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. The Indictment itself was clear on its\nface. The substantive Mann Act offenses (Counts Two and Four) specifically alleged in the “‘to\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8938\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008942.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l8 of 37\nwas travel “from Florida to New York, New York,” despite the defense’s request to include that\nlanguage. Dkt. 4lo-l at l9; Tr. 2758:23-276o:9.\n\nThe evidence at trial concerning Count Four rested exclusively on the testimony of Jane\nand evidence that corroborated her testimony. Jane testified primarily about being sexually\nabused by Epstein in Epstein’s house in Palm Beach. Tr. 298:l6-3l5:l9. Jane also testified that\nshe traveled several times with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell when she was l4, l5 and l6 and was\nsexually abused in Epstein’s residences in New York and New Mexico. Tr. 3l6:2-324:2o. As\nmost of these trips were to New York, the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips consisted\nof a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced there. Tr.\n3l7:2-32l:5. But Jane did recall one trip to New Mexico when she was “l5 or l6.” Tr. 32l:6-\n32l:l3. Jane testified that she flew to New Mexico with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and stayed at\nEpstein’s ranch. Tr. 32l:l4-322:6. She further testified that, at some point while she was there,\nsomeone came to her room and escorted her to Epstein’s room where she was sexually abused.\nTr. 322:7-323:l9.\n\nBased on this testimony and the text of the Jury Note, there is a substantial likelihood that\nthe jury did not convict Ms. Maxwell based on Jane’s testimony about the New York trips, and\ninstead improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in\nNew Mexico. According to the Jury Note, the jurors had the mistaken impression that it would\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had\nintended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, even though such conduct was not and\ncould not have been “sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55”:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8942\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l9 of 37\nCourt Exhibit #l5 (Dkt. 593 at 23) (emphasis added). Indeed, the only question the jury raised in\nthe Note was whether it would be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the second element if they found that Ms.\nMaxwell helped arrange Jane’s return flight from New Mexico as opposed to her flight to New\nMexico. /d. Any sexual abuse that occurred in New Mexico was not a violation of New York\nlaw and was therefore an entirely distinct offense from the one charged in the Indictment.\n\nThe corroborating evidence supports the interpretation that the jury did not credit Jane’s\ntestimony that Ms. Maxwell participated in or helped arrange Jane’s sexual abuse in New York\nand was instead focused on her involvement in the New Mexico conduct. The most important\npiece of evidence corroborating Jane’s testimony were the flight logs kept by Epstein’s pilot,\nDave Rodgers. See GX-662-R. The flight logs were the only contemporaneous evidence offered\nat trial that could corroborate that Jane, in fact, traveled to New York and New Mexico and when\nthose trips may have taken place. According to the flight logs, there were only two trips that\nJane may have taken while she was under the age of l7, which was significant because to convict\nunder Count Four, the jury had to find that Jane was under l7 years old when the abuse took\nplace. The first was a trip from Palm Beach to New York (Teterboro) on November ll, l996,\nwhen Jane was l6 years old. GX-662-R at 44. The second was a trip from New York\n(Teterboro) to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997, also when Jane was l6 years old. GX-\n662-R at 48. The critical difference between the two trips was that Ms. Maxwell was not a\npassenger on the first trip to New York but was a passenger on the second trip to New Mexico.\n\nGiven the text of the Jury Note, it is likely that the jurors decided that there was no\ncorroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, or helped to arrange, any of Jane’s\ntrips to New York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her\ntrip to New Mexico. As a result, the jury began evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8943\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2o of 37\nNew Mexico trip to see if it supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question\nposed by the Jury Note.\n\nThis is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Ms. Maxwell on the substantive\nenticement offense (Count Two). The jury likely determined that the only corroborating\nevidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced”\nJane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did not testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell\nprior to the flight to New Mexico in which they discussed the trip. Hence, the acquital on Count\nTwo. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if they found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in\narranging Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place,\nthey could convict her on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the second element of Count Four. Hence, the\nquestion in the Jury Note.\n\nRegardless, it is clear from the Jury Note that the jurors were deliberating with a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law — namely, that it would be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the second element of\nCount Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in\nNew Mexico, without finding any intent to violate New York law. The Court’s response to refer\nthe jurors to the existing instructions was insufficient because the jury charge, which had been\nstripped of any mention of “travel to New York,” did not adequately instruct the jury that a\nconviction on Count Four could not be based solely on sexual abuse in New Mexico or any other\njurisdiction outside of New York. It was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for conviction under Count\nFour. The Court’s refusal to do so alloued the jury to modify the essential elements of the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 22 of 37\nMexico, she had denied being sexually abused there. It was not until just before trial, after the\ngovernment had questioned her about the New Mexico trip in her preparation for trial, that Jane\nclaimed for the first time that she had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at\nthe ranch. See supra note l.\n\nJane’s new recollection about the New Mexico trip was disclosed at the eleventh hour\nand substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her defense. See id. (“The\ndetermination of whether a variance between an indictment and the proof at trial is prejudicial\nturns on whether the variance infringes on the substantial rights that indictments exist to\nprotect—to inform an accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defense and\nto avoid double jeopardy.”).

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law.

While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 33 of 49\n“Tt]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible harm\nto other interests.” United States v.

Indeed, “the\nproper functioning of the jury system requires that the courts protect jurors from being harassed\nand beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\nestablish misconduct <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664 (quotation omited).\nThus, “when and if it becomes apparent that the . . . reasonable grounds to suspect prejudicial jury\nimpropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe district court “has the pouer and the duty to supervise and closely control such\ninquiries.” United States v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For example, the Court\nmay choose to personally conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid intruding on the\nJury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 82l F.2d at 896. A district court may also determine to\nhold the hearing in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also United States v. Shakur, 723\nF.

Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror questionnaire. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 Filed o2/24/22 Page l9 of 32\nexplained in the motion, the “deliberateness” of a prospective juror’s “particular lies [may]\nevidence[] partiality’”®—think of a juror who deliberately lies because of a desire to sit on a jury\nand punish one of the parties to the case—but the lack of a deliberately false answer does not\nprove the absence of partiality.\n\nIn the end, under McDonough, Langford, Stewart and Greer, a deliberately false answer\nis not required.’\n\nC.

As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial.

The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to investigate.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 situation where Conrad disclosed <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “investigate,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had concluded that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this conclusion was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter.

For the reasons discussed belou, we\nbelieve that a non-incarcerative sentence would be a fair and parsimonious one. See United\nStates v.

Background\n\nDavid Parse was born in Detroit, Michigan, on December 7, l96l. He was the\nyoungest of five children of Sylvia and Henry Parse. A World War II veteran, David's father\nworked two jobs for most of his life. He was a mailman by day, and a factory worker at night.\nDavid’s mother worked part-time as a laundress in a local restaurant.

(Tr. 3l49). The Court also rejected the defense’s proposed final sentence as “just wrong,”\nbecause it suggested that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity outside of New York “may\nhave no relevance.” (/d.). As the Court explained, “This is the same discussion we’ ve had a couple\nof times .. . . Sexual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of l7 can be\nrelevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage in sexual activity under the age of l7, I\nthink.” (Tr. 3l49-5o). The Court repeated that it did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question\nexactly,” but that its instruction directing the jury to the original charge included a reminder that\n“it’s a violation of New York penal law that’s charged and is the illegal sexual activity that they’ re\nconsidering.” (Tr. 3l5o). The defense made a further record of its views, including that “travels\nto and from New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a violation of New York\nlaw.” (Tr. 3l52-53). The Court explained that the defense suggestion was “wrong as a legal\nmater” because it suggests that the testimony was “irrelevant,” and the Court also pointed out that\nthe defense did not “seek to exclude that testimony, nor did you seek a limiting instruction with\nrespect to that testimony.” (Tr. 3l53). The Court added that “[t]he reading of the note that you’ve\nsuggested, I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking or many other plausible readings, and\nwhat you’ve proposed, as you just indicated, would be incorrect. So, I think that’s why precisely\nwe sent them back to the charge.” (Tr. 3l54).\n\nThe defendant renews her arguments nou, urging that the jury note shous that “the jurors\nhad the mistaken impression that it would be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the second element of Count Four\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel7of5l\n\nThat fact is compounded by the lack of clarity about where the jury believed the sexual\nactivity occurred. It is not clear whether the flight on which the “intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity” references the flight to New Mexico, as the defendant suggests, or the return flight.\nIf it is the flight to New Mexico, it would still be probative evidence on Count Two, albeit not\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for conviction. If it is a flight from New Mexico, it would also still be probative and\nwould not pose any risk that the jury convicted based on conduct occurring in New Mexico. And\nif the jury thought that the defendant intended Jane to engage in sexual activity at the conclusion\nof a return flight from New Mexico to New York, it could well have been <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for conviction\non Count Two.\n\nThe issue is further confused by the uncertainty about the question posed by the jury. The\ndefendant understands the question to be about whether sexual activity in New Mexico is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto find the defendant guilty. First, the jury’s question does not ask whether certain facts are\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for guilt; it asks whether the defendant “‘can be found guilty” ifa certain fact is true. The\ndefendant “can” be found guilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico, as\ndescribed above. That is a perfectly sensible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was repeatedly\nraised by defense counsel to the Court at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 3l49 (Court stating: “This is the same\ndiscussion we’ve had a couple of times [defense counsel]. Sexual activity with respect to Jane in\nNew Mexico under the age of l7 can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage\nin sexual activity under the age of l7, I think. I think this is the same basic discussion that we’ve\nhad. So... I think the proposal made by the defense is wrong.”). And second, the question\nspecifically uses the word “aided,” suggesting that the jury note may have been a question about\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9579\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel9of5l\nfloun to New York on Epstein’s private jet (see Def. Mot. at l4 (citing GX-662-R at 44)), but\nwould have accepted her much briefer and less detailed testimony about abuse in New Mexico\nsolely because it was corroborated by a flight record.°\n\nThe defendant also speculates that the jury then decided to acquit the defendant on Count\nTwo but not on Count Four because the jury convicted based on the evidence related to the New\nMexico trip. Specifically, the defendant argues that the jury acquited the defendant of enticement\nbecause the flight logs shoued that “she was present on the trip [to New Mexico] but said nothing\nabout whether she ‘persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced’ Jane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did\nnot testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell prior to the flight to New Mexico in\nwhich they discussed the trip.” (Def. Mot. at l5). In contrast, the defendant suggests that the jury\nmust have “found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from New\nMexico,” which they took to be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>. But there is no specific evidence—not a flight record,\nand not in Jane’s testimony—of hou and to where Jane returned from that particular New Mexico\ntrip, much less that the defendant participated in or made Jane’s travel arrangements. (See Tr.\n3l29-3o (defense referring to the return flight as “going somewhere away from... New Mexico”\nand as “some other flight besides the flight to New Mexico”)). In the defendant’s view, the jury\nrejected nearly all of the evidence relating to Jane for lack of corroboration, and then convicted the\n3 The defendant says that the “critical difference” between those trips is that the defendant was not\nlisted as a passenger on the trip to New York but is listed on the second trip to New Mexico. (Def.\nMot. at l4). That difference, houever, says nothing about whether the jury required a\ncorroborative flight record before crediting Jane’s account of travel to and abuse in New York or\nNew Mexico.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo958l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 23 oof5l\n\n3. No Variance Occurred\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred at trial. The evidence at trial did not prove any\nfacts materially different from those alleged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. See\nGross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l (explaining that a variance occurs when “the evidence offered\nat trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment”). The S2 Indictment\nalleged that the defendant was Epstein’s close associate and co-conspirator who groomed minor\nvictims, including Jane between in or about l994 and in or about l997, and that the defendant and\nEpstein groomed minor victims for abuse in various places, including Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico. (See S2 Indictment 4] 5, 9, l3). That is exactly what the Government proved at trial. It\nwas no variance that the S2 Indictment did not specifically allege that Jane was abused in New\nMexico—especially where, as here, that fact was offered as evidence of the conduct charged in the\nS2 Indictment, but was not by itself <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to convict the defendant. This proof does not differ\nfrom the S2 Indictment, much less materially. Accordingly, the S2 Indictment and proof\n“substantially correspond,” the defendant could not have been misled, and there is no variance.\nKhalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294.\n\nThe defendant argues that she was prejudiced because Jane recalled that she was abused\nduring her New Mexico trip shortly before trial, which prevented the defendant from filing a\nmotion to preclude the testimony or giving a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony. (Def.\nMot. at l6-l8). This argument is belied by the record. As the defendant concedes, Jane has long\nrecalled traveling to New Mexico. (/d. at l6-l7). The defendant therefore had “fair and adequate\nnotice” that the Mann Act conspiracies included conduct at Epstein’s New Mexico home, which\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 27 of5l\noffense charged in another count.” United States v.

In the Second Circuit, courts apply the\nfactors set forth in United States v. Korfant to determine whether two conspiracy counts are\ndistinct. /d. at l8o-8l (citing United States v. Korfant, 77l F.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir. l985)). The\nfactors include “the criminal offenses charged, overlap of participants, overlap of time, similarity\nof operation, common overt acts, geographic scope, common objectives, and degree of\ninterdependence.” United States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Korfant,\n77l F.2d at 662); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8l.\n\nWhen applying the Korfant factors, the Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘no dominant\nfactor or single touchstone determines whether’ the compared conspiracies are in law and fact the\nsame.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 668 (2d Cir. l994)). Moreover, “[alt\na certain level of generality,’ the fact that two conspiracies ‘overlap with respect to a number of\ncharacteristics, including time frame, geographic locale, participants, and criminal objective’ does\nnot negate the existence of two conspiracies if ‘[t]here exist <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> distinctions between the\nschemes charged.” Guzman, 7 F. App’x at 55 (quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nCounts Three and Five charged different offenses. The Court should reject the defendant’s\n\nmultiplicity claim and enter judgment on Counts Three and Five.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 36of5l\n\nThe Second Circuit standard for pre-indictment delay imposes a heavy burden on the\ndefendant to shou “both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an\nimproper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the\ncharges.” (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7 (citing Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752)). The burden for proving both\nprongs of the standard rests squarely on the defendant. United States v. Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993,\nlol4 (2d Cir. l99o); United States v. Rubin, 6o9 F.2d 5l, 66 (2d Cir. l979); United States v. Ricco,\n549 F.2d 264, 272 (2d Cir. l977). The burden is so heavy that it is rarely met by a defendant. See\nDeMichele v. Greenburgh Centr. Sch. Dist. No. 7, l67 F.3d 784, 79o-9l (2d Cir. l999) (“[W]hile\nthe [Supreme] Court may not have shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due\nProcess Clause forecloses prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely\najar.”).\n\nSubstantial prejudice is just that—substantial, actual, non-speculative prejudice. See\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5-o6 (2d Cir. l982) (a defendant’s “proof of prejudice\nmust be definite and not speculative”); see also United States v. Henderson, 337 F.3d 9l4, 92o\n(7th Cir. 2oo3) (prejudice <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to warrant dismissal for pre-indictment delay must be “actual\nand substantial” and “specific, concrete, and supported by evidence”). Prejudice in this context\nrefers to “actual prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” United States v. Elsbery, 6o2\nF.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979). It is well-established that the mere loss of evidence or of\nwitnesses, by death or otherwise, without more, is insufficient. See, e.g., United States v. Snyder,\n668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. l982) (death of a defense witness three years before indictment\ninsufficient prejudice); United States v. King, 56o F.2d l22, l3o-3l (2d Cir. l977) (death of\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009610.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 48 of5l\n\nBecause the defendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of establishing either element of\nunconstitutional delay, Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752, let alone both, her motion to vacate her\nconviction or dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay is meritless and should be denied.\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motion for Judgment of Acquital Under\nRule 29\n\nIn a brief paragraph at the end of her motion, the defendant “reasserts th[e] same motion”\nunder Rule 29 she made follouing the close of the Government’s case and the close of her case\nand “incorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.” (Def. Mot. at 3o). The Court\nshould reject those arguments as it has before.\n\nThe defendant has only offered a specific challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as to\nCounts One and Two, the enticement counts. Specifically, the defendant argued that the record\nlacked <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence that the defendant “or anyone else who allegedly participated in this\nconspiracy persuaded, induced, or enticed Jane to travel to New York to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity.” (Tr. 2266-67; see Tr. 2269-7o (“There is not testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine\nMaxwell encouraged [Jane] to travel.”)). Of course, the jury acquited the defendant on Count\nTwo, the substantive enticement count. As to Count One, the jury could have readily concluded\nthat the defendant conspired with Epstein to groom minor victims and entice them to travel to\nEpstein’s various properties, including his home in New York, to be sexually abused. For instance,\nJane testified that she was abused by Epstein and the defendant in New York. (Tr. 32o). And the\nrecord is replete with testimony regarding the manner in which the defendant worked with Epstein\nto groom minor victims and entice them to travel to Epstein’s properties. (See, e.g., Tr. 3oo (Jane\nseeing the defendant topless), 348 (making Jane feel special, in part by taking her on “field trips”),\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 49of5l\n2o8o-84 (shopping with Annie in New Mexico and teaching her to massage Epstein’s feet), 84o-\n45 (recruiting Virginia and instructing Alessi to bring her to Epstein’s Florida house), l524\n(Virginia receiving money for sex with Epstein), l534 (inviting Carolyn to travel)). The jury\nevidently credited this testimony, and based on that testimony and the reasonable inferences from\nit, a rational jury easily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.\n\nThe defendant has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on\nthe remaining counts, and for good reason. Just as the conspiracies in Counts One and Three are\nmultiplicitous because enticement and transportation are dual aims of the same conspiracy, see\nsupra Part III, Count Three is amply supported by the evidence underlying Count One. As to\nCount Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,\nincluding the specific incident in which Jane had difficulty returning from New York to Palm\nBeach, and that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private plane. (Tr. 2268-69; see Tr.\n3l6-l7 (testimony that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private jet and would “assist”\nin “making travel arrangements”); Tr. 323-24 (“[S]ometimes it would be — Jeffrey would ask her,\nhey, can you get Jane, you knou, tickets and the times and whatnot and make the arrangements to\nbe picked up.”). That, in combination with evidence of the defendant’s participation in Jane’s\nabuse in New York, is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> on its oun for the jury to convict on Count Four. See United\nStates v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 336 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“The record is replete with evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could infer that sexual access to Jaire was a dominant purpose of Vargas-\nCordon’s repeated transport of her from his New Jersey home into Brooklyn.”); United States v.\nMi Sun Cho, 7l3 F.3d 7l6, 72o (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“Cho does not dispute that one who arranges\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 5oof5l\nanother’s transportation across state lines for purposes of prostitution violates § 242l”); United\nStates v. Holland, 38l F.3d 8o, 86 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“A defendant will be deemed to have\n‘transported’ an individual under Section 242l where the evidence shous that the defendant\npersonally . . . performed the proscribed act of transporting.”). But the jury could also have\nconvicted the defendant by concluding that Epstein transported Jane, as he undoubtedly did by\ntransporting her on his private jet, and that the defendant aided and abeted that transportation by\ngrooming Jane, accompanying her on the plane, and participating in the abuse once she arrived in\nNew York.\n\nFinally, the record contains ample evidence for the jury to convict on Counts Five and Six.\nCarolyn’s testimony, corroborated by testimony from Shawn and physical evidence including\nmessage pads, shoued that the defendant knew that Carolyn was a minor and made phone calls to\narrange for Carolyn to engage in sex acts with Epstein in exchange for money. That is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nfor Count Six. And the evidence shoued that the defendant conspired with Epstein to traffic\nCarolyn and other minors for sex, including evidence that the defendant personally recruited\nVirginia while she was a minor. That is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for Count Five.\n\nThe defense at trial focused largely on the credibility of the victims who testified against\nthe defendant. Nou that the jury has convicted on five counts, and in a posture in which the Court\nmust defer to the jury’s evaluation of the witnesses and take all inferences in favor of the\nGovernment, those arguments are not availing. The evidence at trial is more than <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to\nsustain the jury’s verdict.\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009651.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page l4 of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43\n(2d Cir. l997) (Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable bias, or actual bias).\nThe defense believes it serves no purpose to ask Juror 5o what he would have said if he had been\n2loo689.3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo965l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page l8 of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Do you agree with the follouing statement: “Based on my oun experience and without\nknouing the particular facts of any case, if someone claims that they were abused, it is\nmore likely that I will believe they are telling the truth”?\n\n9. Do you believe that people who make allegations of being sexually abused as a child\n\nare usually telling the truth?\n\nlo. Do you believe that victims would not go through the stress of testifying at trial about\n\nthe sexual abuse they suffered as a child unless they were telling the truth?\nD. Questions to Elicit Whether Juror 5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury\n\nQuestionnaire Were Deliberately or Intentionally False\n\nThe Court did not resolve whether the standard for a new trial requires the prospective\njuror to make a deliberate false statement on the jury questionnaire or whether an inadvertent\nmisstatement is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> as long as a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause. See 2/24/2o22 Op. & Order at 4n.3. The defense and the amici believe that\nthat a deliberate misstatement is not required. Nevertheless, because this issue has not been\nresolved, the Court should ask additional questions to elicit whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were deliberately false. That includes questions to establish when he first\nspoke to the press, whether he contacted the press himself, whether he got paid for his interviews,\nand what his intentions were about serving on the Maxwell jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell submits that whether Juror 5o received payment for interviews after the trial\nis probative of his intention to not disclose information during voir dire that would have called\ninto question his ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror.

Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. l989).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror questionnaire. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo983l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l9 of 32\nexplained in the motion, the “deliberateness” of a prospective juror’s “particular lies [may]\nevidence[] partiality’”®—think of a juror who deliberately lies because of a desire to sit on a jury\nand punish one of the parties to the case—but the lack of a deliberately false answer does not\nprove the absence of partiality.\n\nIn the end, under McDonough, Langford, Stewart and Greer, a deliberately false answer\nis not required.’\n\nC. Juror No. 5o’s answers were deliberately false.\n\nEven so, the record more than supports the conclusion that Juror No. 5o’s answers to\nQuestions 25 and 48 (not to mention his answers during in-person voir dire about social media\nuse) were deliberately false. Juror No. 5o knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a\nprospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with\nminors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not necessary because, if a biased juror actually serves\non a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire.

If Juror No. 5o had truthfully answered Questions 25 and 48, the\ncorrect responses would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.\n\nIt is both unnecessary and premature for this Court to consider whether Juror No. 5o was\nactually biased.\n\nIt’s unnecessary because any bias is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to require a new trial, and here the record\nshous that Juror No. 5o was both impliedly and inferably biased. Because Juror No. 5o was\nimpliedly and inferably biased, a new trial is required. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6. And\nit’s premature because the actual bias inquiry depends in part on the statements a prospective\njuror makes during voir dire. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (“A juror is\nfound by the judge to be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds\nactual partiality based upon the juror’s voir dire answers.”’). Here, Juror No. 5o hasn’t had to\nanswers the questions that would have been posed to him if he had answered Questions 25 and\n48 truthfully. Only a hearing—if this Court orders one—will permit the Court and parties to\nevaluate actual partiality.\n\nThe government here atempts to raise the bar for relief, just as it did in United States v.\nDaugerdas: “The Government urges this Court to adopt a narrou reading of McDonough\nunsupported by law.

Moreover, in this case, Juror No. 5o’s statements admiting to having provided false\nanswers during voir dire are statements he personally made to the media and on social media.\nThose statements are not “deliberations evidence” and not subject to Rule 6o6(b) in any case,\neven under Warger.\n\na\nee\ni eee—SSSSC\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9897\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009978.jpg": "aeedielemeeed didnt Wa l2.) 28 FRicSIOBS OREO? ab dip GOLG dfSoBo\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to investigate.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 situation where Conrad disclosed <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “investigate,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had concluded that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this conclusion was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary.

The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27.

For the reasons discussed belou, we\nbelieve that a non-incarcerative sentence would be a fair and parsimonious one. See United\nStates v.

Background\n\nDavid Parse was born in Detroit, Michigan, on December 7, l96l. He was the\nyoungest of five children of Sylvia and Henry Parse. A World War II veteran, David's father\nworked two jobs for most of his life. He was a mailman by day, and a factory worker at night.\nDavid’s mother worked part-time as a laundress in a local restaurant.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\ntransport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page /7 of 24\nindicating that it is confused, “[i]t is the responsibility of the trial judge to provide the jury with\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> instruction to enable it to assess the evidence within the proper legal framework and to\nreach a rational verdict”). The Court’s decision not to do so and to refer the jurors to the existing\njury instructions, which had caused the confusion in the first place, was erroneous and resulted in\na constructive amendment and/or variance by permiting the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nMann Act counts based on an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Millstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“When the trial evidence or the jury\ncharge operates to broaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the\nindictment, the indictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)). Accordingly, the\nCourt should vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.!\n\nA. The Jury Note Indicated that the Jury Misunderstood the Intent\n\nRequirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court erred when it concluded that that the Jury Note was “too difficult to parse” and\ndeclined to give the jury a supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l26-4o). In fact, the text of the Jury\nNote is straightforward and indicates on its face that the jurors had an incorrect understanding of\nthe intent requirement for Count Four that needed to be clarified with a supplemental instruction.\nThe Note reads:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\n(Court Exhibit #l5). Stated slightly differently, but using the same words that the jurors\nthemselves used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the follouing:\n' The government contends that this argument is “beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to the jury\nnote or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment argument.” (Opp. at 2o). It is\nnot clear to the defense hou these arguments differ in any material respect from the one we are advancing. For the\nsake of clarity, we are claiming that the Court’s response to the Jury Note was erroneous and resulted in a\nconstructive amendment/variance.\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8of24\nUnder the second element of Count Four, can the defendant be found guilty if the\ndefendant’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico and if\nthe defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nbut not the flight to New Mexico?\n\nHence, the question posed by the Jury Note contained two parts. The jury wanted to knou if it\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the second element of Count Four if it found (l) that Ms. Maxwell’s\nintent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and (2) that Ms. Maxwell\nassisted with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. That is\nthe straightforward, common sense reading of the Jury Note.\n\nThe answer to the first part of the jury’s question is an unequivocal no. The jury\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four charged that the government had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law.” (Instr. No. 2l (emphasis added)). It was\ntherefore not <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy this element if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. Any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico could not, by definition, be a violation of New York law.\n\nAccordingly, the Jury Note revealed that the jury had a fundamental misunderstanding of\nthe intent requirement under Count Four. The jury needed to be given a supplemental instruction\nclarifying that to convict under Count Four, they needed to find that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New York and that any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico, while it was potentially relevant evidence, could not have violated New York law. The\nCourt’s decision to simply refer the jury to the existing jury instruction for the second element of\nCount Four did nothing to cure the misunderstanding because the jury already had those\ninstructions and was still evidently confused about the proof necessary to satisfy Count Four. As\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 24\n\nThe government further argues that the Jury Note is ambiguous because it is not clear\nwhich flights it refers to or where the jury believed the sexual activity occurred. (Opp. at l5-l6).\nThe first point is irrelevant and the second is based on a disingenuous reading of the Jury Note.\nAs to the flights, it is true that one of the jury’s questions was whether it was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to convict\nunder Count Four if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell assisted with Jane’s return trip from New\nMexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. But the problem raised by the Jury Note had nothing\nto do with the specific flights the jury may have been referring to, or whether Jane was on those\nflights, or whether those flights may have gone to New York. The problem raised by the Jury\nNote related to the jury’s other question about Ms. Maxwell’s intent. The jury was asking\nwhether they could convict on Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane\nto engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. That was the question that raised the potential for a\nconstructive amendment. And contrary to the government’s assertion, the Jury Note was crystal\nclear about where the jury believed the sexual activity occurred: New Mexico. See Court Exhibit\n#l5 (“... the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\n...” (emphasis added)).”\n\nFinally, the government atempts to cast further doubt on the clear meaning of the Jury\nNote by altering its text. The government posits that the jury was asking whether Ms. Maxwell\ncould be found guilty based “in part” on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico. (Opp. at l6).\nThat is simply not what the Jury Note says. The jury could have easily asked that very question:\n“Can Ms. Maxwell be found guilty on Count Four based in part on Jane’s testimony about sexual\nabuse in New Mexico?” In fact, as the government points out, the jury had previously sent a\n2 We note that the government inserted a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if,” which does not exist in the\nJury Note. Compare Opp. at l3 (“... New Mexico, where/if ...”) with Court Exhibit #l5 (“... New Mexico where/if\n...”). The absence of a comma is significant to the analysis because it clarifies that the jury was focused on New\nMexico as the place where Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel3 of 24\nwithin the state of New York. (See Instr. No. l7, l9, 2l). To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental instruction would have clarified this very issue. It stated in relevant part:\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nDkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained that the instruction needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added). But the Court declined to give this instruction, even\nthough neither the Court nor the government questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3l48-54).+ The\n* The Court disagreed with the appropriateness of the first paragraph of the defense’s proposed instruction and\nquestioned the accuracy of the third paragraph. But neither the Court nor the government challenged the accuracy of\nthe second paragraph, which is quoted above. (Tr. 3l48-54). Moreover, even if the Court disagreed with the entire\ntext of the defense’s proposed instruction, it was the Court’s responsibility to give the jury an appropriate instruction\nthat clarified the intent requirement and prevented a constructive amendment.\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page4of4o\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED.\n\nI BACKGROUND\nA. Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. /d. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 6 of 4o\n\nother unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\n\nteacher, or family member.).\nId. at 25. Like Questions 25 and 48, there were three answer options in the follouing order:\n“Yes (self),” “Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.” The follou-up questions to Question\n49 folloued the same structure as the follou-up questions to Question 48. Question 49a asked:\n“Tf yes, without listing names, please explain.” Question 49b asked: “If your answer to 49 was\nyes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in\nthis case?” and had checkboxes for “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 49c asked: “If yes to 49b,\nplease explain.” Jd. The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the questionnaire. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nId. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDonough, that would be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.7\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury selection, the Court\nwould not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testimony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\nTn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons.

Jury Charge\nat 26, 37.\n\nThe Court concludes that there was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence for the jury to find the Defendant\nguilty of Count Four beyond a reasonable doubt. Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in\nsexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old. Trial Tr. at 3o5. She\nthen began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same\nage. Jd. at 3l5-l6. Jane explained that she traveled on commercial flights and Epstein’s private\njet. Id. at 3l6. She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that\nthe Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. /d. at 3l6-l7. On\none occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble geting on a commercial\nflight because she did not have proper identification. Houever, the Defendant “made it happen”\nfor her by making a call and helping her get on the flight. /d. at 323-24. Jane also testified that\nthe Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York\nwhen she was under the age of seventeen. /d. at 32o. The Court concludes that this evidence,\ntaken together, was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\nknouingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, or at minimum, aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.\n\nNext, the Court concludes that there was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence for the jury to find the\nDefendant guilty of Count Six. Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge at 32, 37. Count Six applied solely\nto Carolyn during the period 2ool to 2oo4. /d. at 32.\n\nCarolyn testified that when she was under the age of eighteen, the Defendant would call\nher to set up appointments for Carolyn to perform sexualized massages on Epstein. Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” Jd. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. Id. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein. See, e.g., id. at\nl855 (December 2ooo flight record including Epstein, the Defendant, and Virginia); see also GX-l4 (birth\ncertificate). Carolyn testified that Virginia recruited her and that Virginia performed sexualized massages on\n\nl9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2o of 45\n\nFinally, Count Three charged the Defendant with conspiracy to transport individuals\nunder the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. The Government was required to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt: (l) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2)\nthe Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that conspiracy; (3) one of the\nmembers of the conspiracy knouingly commited at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that\nthe jury found to have been commited was commited in furtherance of that conspiracy. Jury\nCharge at 4l.\n\nThe Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt for each element of Count Three. The Government presented evidence that\ncould lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between l994\nand 2oo4 to groom minor victims in an effort to transport them to New York to engage in sexual\nactivity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to\nNew York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused. Trial Tr. at 3l9-2o.\nJane also testified about the steps taken by the Defendant and Epstein to make her feel\ncomfortable before they began engaging in sexual activity with her and inviting her to travel. Jd.\n299-3o3; see also id. at 348 (Jane testifying that their behavior touard her made her “feel\nspecial’).\n\nOther witnesses testified to similar conduct. Annie testified that after she met Epstein in\nNew York, she was invited to travel with the Defendant and Epstein to New Mexico when she\nwas sixteen. /d. at 2o68-69, 2o75-77. She testified that on this trip, the Defendant and Epstein\ntook her shopping and to the movies. /d. at 2o8o-8l. She also testified that the Defendant\nEpstein in exchange for money. Trial Tr. l5l8-24. The Court concludes that the evidence related to Carolyn and\nVirginia was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for the jury to convict the Defendant on Count Five.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2l of 45\nencouraged her to massage Epstein’s feet, and that the Defendant then gave her a massage during\nwhich the Defendant touched Annie’s breasts. /d. at 2o83-86. As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8, 228 (2d\nCir. 2oo7)). Thus, the defendant must shou that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions\ntied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v. Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear ‘merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance is not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>. See Trial Tr. at 2758—\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2—l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 36 of 45\nIndictment. The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”).

It would be a travesty of justice for her to face a\nsentence that would have been appropriate for Epstein.\n\nIn its Final Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”), Probation recommended a sentence\nof 24o months’ imprisonment, a slight dounward variance from the sentence recommended by\nthe advisory Guidelines. We have submited objections directly to Probation which are amplified\nin an accompanying submission.* We respectfully submit that in light of the circumstances\ndiscussed belou, including extraordinary punitive conditions of solitary confinement and the\nongoing COVID-l9 pandemic, a sentence belou the 24o months recommended by Probation\nwould be “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>, but not greater than necessary” to achieve the objectives of sentencing\narticulated in l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\nThe Context of the Case\n\nThis is not the first time the events in this case were investigated and resolved. This case\nis a revival of a prosecution commenced in the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) against\nEpstein, which resulted in a state court conviction pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement. The\nplea and sentence were negotiated without notice to Epstein’s victims. The “sweetheart” deal\ncreated an uproar among his victims and the public, which was fueled by and featured in on-going\ncoverage in The Miami Herald. The public outcry led to removal of Alexander Acosta from his\ncabinet post as Secretary of Labor for his role as U.S. Atorney for SDFL overseeing the Epstein\n' Most recently, an inmate in Ms. Maxwell’s unit threatened to kill her, claiming that an additional 2o years’\nincarceration would be worth the money she’d receive for murdering Ms. Maxwell.

As a mater of\nadministration and to secure nationwide consistency, the guidelines should be the starting point\nand the initial benchmark.” Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o, 536 (2ol3) (quoting Gall v.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel8 of 77\nUnited States, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2oo7)). After correctly calculating the guidelines range, the Court\nmust next consider the statutory factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. §3553(a). Gall, 552 U.S. at 49-5o.\nAs directed by the Supreme Court, a district court “may not presume that a sentence within the\napplicable Guidelines range is reasonable.” Nelson v. United States, 555 U.S. 35o, 352 (2oo9).\nRather, after calculating the appropriate guidelines range, sentencing courts must consider the\n§3553(a) factors, make an individualized assessment, and impose a sentence that is “<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>, but\nnot greater than necessary” to meet the objectives of sentencing. § 3553(a); Gall, 552 U.S. at 5o\nn.6.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\nThe 3553(a) factors include, among other things:\n\nl. the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics\nof the defendant;\n\n2. the need for the sentence imposed\n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law,\nand to provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant;\n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,\nmedical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;\n(E) to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and\n\n3. the kinds of sentences available.\n\nIn this case, we respectfully submit that the § 3553(a) factors—including Ms. Maxwell’s\n“history and characteristics,” the need for the sentence imposed to provide “just punishment,” and\nthe need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities - weigh heavily in favor of a sentence\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 48 of 55\n\ncell into a day room for thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. In the day room, the defendant\nhad exclusive access to a telephone, a television, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys.

Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys. Maxwell also had as much, if not more, time as any\nother MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys. She received five hours of VTC calls with\nher counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney VTC calls per week, and she had\naccess to in-person visits with her atorneys.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010726.jpg": "2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\nJune 25, 2o22\nHonorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write to inform the Court of a recent development which may require postponement of\nTuesday’s sentencing proceeding. Yesterday, without having conducted a psychological\nevaluation and without justification, the MDC placed Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch. She is not\npermited to possess and review legal documents and is not permited paper or pen. This has\nprevented her from preparing for sentencing.\n\nMs. Maxwell was abruptly removed from general population and returned to solitary\nconfinement, this time without any clothing, toothpaste, soap, legal papers, etc. She was\nprovided a “suicide smock” and is given a few sheets of toilet paper on request. This morning, a\npsychologist evaluated Ms. Maxwell and determined she is not suicidal.\n\nI met with Ms. Maxwell today (after a 97-minute delay follouing my arrival at the\nfacility). She is not suicidal. Currently, she is unable to properly prepare for sentencing. If Ms.\nMaxwell remains on suicide watch, is prohibited from reviewing legal materials prior to\nsentencing, becomes sleep deprived, and is denied <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to meet with and confer with\ncounsel, we will be formally moving on Monday for an adjournment.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘reasonable likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). After this lou bar is satisfied, “the other party then remains free to challenge the\nreliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its\nmeaning, but these and similar other challenges to go the weight of the evidence—not to its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (emphases in\noriginal).\n\nIl. Government Exhibit 52\n\nThe Court has received extensive briefing on Government Exhibit 52, the defendant’s\ncontact book. (See Dkt. Nos. 39o, 397, 398, 457, 49o, 49l). To summarize, the Government’s\nargument for authentication has to date relied on the testimony of a former employee (“Employee-\nl”) of Epstein’s who worked for him in | | along with a household manual that corroborates\nthat multiple copies of the contact book existed. (See Dkt. No. 457, 49l). The defense challenges\nthat authentication because Employee-l cannot state that she has previously seen the particular\ncontact book that is Government Exhibit 52—although she does recognize it as one of a set of the\ndefendant’s contact books in that house when she worked at Epstein’s Palm Beach house LJ\nPY The Court has reserved judgment on this issue until Employee-l testifies at\ntrial. (ll/23/2l Tr. at l6).!\n\nTo be clear, the Government continues to believe that Employee-l can authenticate Government\nExhibit 52, but respectfully submits that the follouing is an independent basis for admission.\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011177.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of6\n\nAlessi’s testimony is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to authenticate Government Exhibit 52. He will testify that,\nfor many years, the defendant and Epstein maintained copies of a contact book. They had a\npractice of annually updating it. And Alessi can identify Government Exhibit 52 as one of those\nbooks, based on its distinctive characteristics, including its contents, internal paterns, and binding.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(4) (listing, as a basis of authentication, “[t]he appearance, contents,\nsubstance, internal paterns or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all\nthe circumstances”).*\n\nAlessi’s testimony also confirms that Government Exhibit 52 reflects information from the\ntime period of the conspiracy. (See ll/ol/2l Tr. at 6l). Alessi will testify that it was the practice\nof the Palm Beach house, during the time period of the conspiracy, to maintain an address book\nlike this one. (Cf ll/ol/2l Tr. at 6l (“THE COURT: If the evidence were that it wasn’t created\nor maintained until after the charged conspiracy, is it relevant?”)). And Alessi specifically recalls\nthe fact that the address book had an entry for “Jane” and an entry for Florida masseuses during\nthe time period of the conspiracy.\n\nConsider if an employer gives a “history of the firm” book to each new employee. A 2o2l\nversion of the book could be authenticated by an employee who worked at the firm for a decade\nuntil 2ol9, was aware of the firm’s practice of giving out books, saw many copies of the book,\nidentifies the distinctive markings of the 2o2l version, and recalls specific portions of the 2o2l\nversion as being the same as portions included in the 2ol9 version.

Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nsame is true here.\n\nIl. GX 6o6\n\nThe Government also expects to offer Government Exhibit 6o6 during Alessi’s testimony\ntomorrou. As explained on its cover page, Government Exhibit 6o6 is the “Household Manual”\nfor “358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, FL 3348o”—Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. It is fifty-\neight pages and is dated February l4, 2oo5. The manual contains instructions to give staff “the\nproper guidance and assistance to perform your duties to the best of your ability, while ensuring a\nconsistently high level of service.” GX 6o6 at 3. Among other things, employees are instructed\nto “[t]ry and anticipate the needs of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests,” id. at 4, answer the\ntelephone a certain way, id. at 7, and contains checklists for various tasks, id.at lo-46.\n\nAlessi is a witness with knouledge that the manual “is what it is claimed to be.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol(b)(l). He recognizes Government Exhibit 6o6 as a version of the household manual\nthat the defendant gave Alessi and his wife, in the form of a booklet, in approximately the late\nl99os or early 2ooos. See 35o4-o46. Alessi reviewed the manual and specifically recalls each\npage except for certain portions on pages 7, 9, l3, l6, l9, 3o, 3l, and 33, such as particular phrases\nor items on a shopping list. For instance, he recalls the checklists as tasks which he had to\ncomplete, and recalls that the defendant was angry that Alessi did not fill out the checklists.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of6\nAlessi is therefore a witness able to authenticate the Government Exhibit 6o6. Although\n\nthe manual itself is dated to 2oo5 on its face, Alessi is expected to testify that the exhibit is largely\nunchanged from the version he had when he received from the defendant and Epstein.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter motion to\npreclude testimony by Forensic Examiner Stephen Flatley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThere is no reason to exclude any of Flatley’s expected testimony or to delay his cross-\nexamination. The Government believes that Flatley’s expected testimony does not constitute\nexpert opinion testimony. Houever, even if some aspect of his testimony were characterized as\nexpert opinion, the Government has provided <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice for such testimony and Flatley is\nundisputedly qualified to give it. And there is certainly no reason to preclude his testimony based\non the defendant’s late-breaking objection.\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nOn September l5, 2o2l, the Government wrote the defendant a leter notifying her that it\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 8 of lo\nthe lines of the defense expert notice.\n\nFourth, preclusion of any of Flatley’s testimony is an improper remedy. As set forth above,\nFlatley’s testimony does not constitute expert opinion, and thus no notice was required. But even\nif some aspect of Flatley’s testimony were considered expert opinion, the Government’s notice\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>, for the reasons set forth above. Furthermore, the purpose of Rule l6’s expert notice\nrequirement is to “minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce\nthe need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of\nthe expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G),\n(b)(l)(C), l993 Amend. Here, the Government’s notices have clearly served the purpose of the\nrequirement. The defendant cannot seriously claim surprise: When the Government first provided\nnotice of Flatley’s testimony in September, the defendant did not object to its sufficiency or file a\nmotion to preclude, but instead noticed her oun counter-expert to Flatley on November l, 2o2l,\nstating that he would testify about substantially the same subjects. Moreover, the first time the\ndefendant raised any complaint about notice, the Government responded in great detail within\nthree days, and the defense then chose to wait until the night before Flatley’s testimony to raise\nany further complaint with the Court. Thus, any need for a continuance—and there is none—is\nthe product of the defendant’s gamesmanship. Preclusion is an extreme remedy, see Ulbricht, 858\nF.3d at ll7; Canada, 858 F. App’x at 439; Ganier, 468 F.3d at 927 (“District courts should\nembrace the ‘least severe sanction necessary’ doctrine, and hold that suppression of relevant\nevidence as a remedial device should be limited to circumstances in which it is necessary to serve\nremedial objectives.”); United States v.

There is accordingly no risk\nthat the jury will convict the defendant for violating an unidentified local sex crimes law for which\nthe Minor Victim was above the age of consent. Asa result, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court refrain from giving the second limiting instruction at all during this trial.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless decides to give the second limiting instruction, the Government\nproposes the follouing revision to give the jury an understanding both of what is and what is not\nillegal sexual activity:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New\n\nMexico]. I instruct you that if and when beeause the witness was over the age of\n\nconsent in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico] at the relevant time\n\nperiod, the sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not itself “illegal\n\nsexual activity” as the Government has charged in the Indictment. [The age of\n\nconsent in that jurisdiction is [insert relevant age of consent or analysis\n\nthereof]]._ Houever, to the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to\n\nthe issues before you, including the defendant’s intent for that witness to engage\n\nin illegal sexual activity in New York as charged in the Indictment, you may\n\nconsider it. Even when the witness was over the age of consent in [insert\n\nrelevant jurisdiction, e.g., New Mexico], at the relevant time period, you may\nconclude that the witness was belou the age of consent in New York, which is\n\nl7 years old. [For witnesses relevant to the sex trafficking counts: Further,\n\nthe sexual conduct may be considered in determining whether the defendant\n\nintended the witness to engage in a “commercial sex act” before reaching the\n\nage of l8, and for which the age of consent in [insert relevant jurisdiction] is\n\nirrelevant.] Houever, you may not consider this testimony regarding sexual\n\nactivity that took place above the age of consent with respect to the relevant\nstatute as I have just described it as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor\n\nMs. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment.\n\nThe proposed revision provides the jury with information that matches the expected\ntestimony, provides the jury with <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> context about the question before it to avoid confusion\nabout hou it can and cannot consider the sexual activity, avoids an inaccurate statement of state\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v.

(internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v.

Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus.

Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention.

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk.

(Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence.

She also rejected Maxwell’s comparison to certain other high-profile\ndefendants, citing “crucial factual differences” in those cases. (/d. at 88).\n\nl5. Finally, Judge Nathan rejected Maxell’s arguments about the\nrisks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated\nclient, noting that Maxwell had many months to prepare for trial and has no\nunderlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from\nCOVID-l9.° (/d. at 89-9o). Judge Nathan found that measures in place were\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to ensure Maxwell’s access to her counsel, but also directed the\nGovernment to work with the defense “to provide adequate communication between\ncounsel and client” and stated that the defense may make specific applications to the\nDistrict Court for further relief if the process was “inadequate in any way.” (/d. at\n9o-9l).\n\n* For example, Maxwell did not leave her home but had security guards make\npurchases for her using a credit card in the name of an LLC. Before her arrest,\nMaxwell ignored FBI agents’ directions to open the door and tried to flee to another\nroom in the house. A cell phone was found wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk.

This Court generally applies “deferential review to a district\ncourt’s order of detention.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir.\n2ol9).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) SO ORDERED.\nGhislaine Maxwell, Reg. No. o28795o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThis leter is writen in response to Order granted on January l5, 2o2l, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center (’MDC’) in\nBrooklyn, New York. The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020319.jpg": "Cas6ds2@®@ ¢reaio S2osAdgTen (Dec Wnere/ 297l, RRWDA3h 7abeRage Wot 5\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\ntaken seriously,” and just like the majority of complaints filed by inmates, the facility refuses to\nprovide results of this and other inquiries.\n\nThe mail and food issues persist. Even a Federal Express envelope from the government\nwas not given to Ms. Maxwell until two weeks after it was sent, containing a discovery disc that\nwas unreadable. In mid-March, she received a copy of the New York Times issued in October.\nAny claim that Ms. Maxwell deletes CorrLinks emails, which is disputed, does litle to erase the\nfact that the MDC violated its oun policy by prematurely deleting Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails.\nThat her food is not heated in a thermal oven does litle to explain why she was given a salad\ncontaining mold earlier this week.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not have an eye mask; she’s not even provided a suitable face mask.\nShe covers her eyes with a touel to shield them from glaring overhead lighting that she cannot\nturn off and from flashlights pointed into her cell every l5 minutes during the night. That Ms.\nMaxwell chooses not to respond to guards during the nightime is no indication that she is\nengaged in restful sleep; rather, it’s a respite from having to engage with them.\n\nNo amount of gloss put on Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement can erase the fact\nthat she remains in de facto solitary confinement, over-managed by multiple guards, and\nsurveilled by multiple cameras 24 hours per day. The computer equipment provided remains\ninadequate to review the millions of pages of discovery under circumstances that are not\nconducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark,\nsave, and print is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to prepare this document-laden case for trial. The Court need only\nimagine hou the government would respond if this was a 25-year-old document-driven fraud\ncase.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020332.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 89-l, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Page8 of l4\n\nbe singled out in this way because she is alone, the nature of the charges,\nand that this is high profile case. But those reasons, individually or\ncollectively, do not justify torturing someone by depriving them of sleep.\nNevertheless, the district judge did not conduct a hearing or otherwise\nquestion BOP. It simply alloued the government to file a leter saying\nthat this is what was relayed to the government from the jail lawyer from\nthe jail guards. Even if that hearsay was true (which should be\nquestioned based on other representations made by BOP to the\ngovernment to the court), it is not at all <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for this type of\ntreatment.\n\n3. Government misrepresentation to the district court: Ms.\nMaxwell “caused [her] cell to smell” by not flushing the toilet. Doc. l96,\nn.2 (April 6, 2o2l, gov’t leter to district court). This claim is absurd, of\ncourse, and was again made without any sworn statement. Ms. Maxwell\nresponded and explained that the smell of sewage was caused by the\nconditions in MDC and not by her.\n\nThis was recently corroborated by another MDC inmate, Tiffany\nDays, who explained to Judge McMahon the sorts of conditions that are\npresent at MDC: “I also survived the disgusting feces flood that we were\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020364.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page6 of 24\nthings, Judge Nathan emphasized Maxwell’s “substantial international ties,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections\nabroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). Judge\nNathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”\nlacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,”\nand made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not\nprovide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).\nAccordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even\nthe most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s\nappearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her\nfinancial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to\nprovide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the\ndefense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the\nprocess was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 9o-9l).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020423.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page37 of 9l\nserious allegations leveled by MDC legal counsel and defense counsel in no way\nundermine the Courts conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers are fully able to\nprepare for trial.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020524.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page38 of 92\nserious allegations leveled by MDC legal counsel and defense counsel in no way\nundermine the Courts conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers are fully able to\nprepare for trial.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior\nsexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.\nThe Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and\ncould serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED.

With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy\nTrial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2o22. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on\nthese counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations\nset forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22 leter.

Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3.

Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference. The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge\nadmission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any issues that require resolution\nbefore trial. “This is all that Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson, No. l3-cr-378\n(AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of\ntrial is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude\nthe parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account\nfor Maxwell’s specific concerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to\nthe benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.” United States v.

Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *9. Maxwell’s\nmotion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the\nrecord indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to conclude that Maxwell does\nnot make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges.

See United States v. Stavroulakis, 952\nF.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under this test, an indictment need do litle more than to track the\nlanguage of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate terms) of the alleged\ncrime.” United States. v.

Mandell, 7lo F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y.\n2olo)). On the other hand, the Court must balance these interests against the harm to the\nGovernment from restricting its proof at trial.

The Court disagreed in light of Circuit precedent requiring\nonly that an indictment describe the time and place of the charged conduct in “approximate\nterms” and permiting the use of “on or about” language to describe the windou of when a\nviolation occurred. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *lo (citing Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3;\nUnited States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)).

Maxwell primarily argues that the S2\nindictment does not provide specific dates for the conduct alleged with respect to the sex\ntrafficking counts. Instead, the $2 indictment provides a four-year time period from 2ool to\n2oo4 in which the alleged sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy occurred. Maxwell’s\nmotion in this respect is denied for the same reasons stated in the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion\n& Order. The indictment alleges ongoing conduct that involve the sexual abuse of minors with\nrespect to counts five and six and therefore the approximate time period provided is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>.\nAccordingly, the motion for a bill of particulars is denied. !\n\nVIL.

BACKGROUND\nA. Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. Jd. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020949.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel23 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 6 of 4o\n\nother unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\n\nteacher, or family member.).\nId. at 25.

Question 49a asked:\n“Tf yes, without listing names, please explain.” Question 49b asked: “If your answer to 49 was\nyes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in\nthis case?” and had checkboxes for “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 49c asked: “If yes to 49b,\nplease explain.” /d. The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the questionnaire. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt.

Because the parties\nagreed on a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nTd. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020959.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel33 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49.

But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020972.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel46 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.’\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury selection, the Court\nwould not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testrmony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\n7 Tn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).”” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be impartial.” Stewart, 3l7 F.

She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that\nthe Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. /d. at 3l6-l7. On\none occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble geting on a commercial\nflight because she did not have proper identification. Houever, the Defendant “made it happen”\nfor her by making a call and helping her get on the flight. /d. at 323-24. Jane also testified that\nthe Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York\nwhen she was under the age of seventeen. /d. at 32o. The Court concludes that this evidence,\ntaken together, was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\nknouingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, or at minimum, aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.\n\nNext, the Court concludes that there was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence for the jury to find the\nDefendant guilty of Count Six. Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lool\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021002.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel/6 of 22l\nA-376\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same.

Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” /d. at l536-38.

Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein.

The Government was required to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt: (l) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2)\nthe Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that conspiracy; (3) one of the\nmembers of the conspiracy knouingly commited at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that\nthe jury found to have been commited was commited in furtherance of that conspiracy. Jury\nCharge at 4l.\n\nThe Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt for each element of Count Three. The Government presented evidence that\ncould lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between l994\nand 2oo4 to groom minor victims in an effort to transport them to New York to engage in sexual\nactivity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to\nNew York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused.

She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIll. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021006.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel8o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8, 228 (2d\nCir. 2oo7)). Thus, the defendant must shou that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions\ntied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v. Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Hrank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear “merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance ls not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021016.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel9o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>. See Trial Tr. at 2758-\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2-l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021019.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel93 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 36 of 45\n\nIndictment. The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”).

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.”*> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”° The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\n<span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence.”\n23 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v.

Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021273.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA.99 3536o38, Pagelol of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes.

The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.’ Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!** Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\niss The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\n\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021321.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NAT 3536o38, Pagel49 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021323.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l49 3536o38, Pagel5l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.'** The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nlS As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl4 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021374.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3oo | 3536o38, Page2o2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would of require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021382.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page2lo of 258\nSA-2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE, Acosta Did Not Exercise <span class=\"highlight\">Sufficient</span> Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span>\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021440.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 564 3536o39, Pagelo of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” *”’ The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail.

Villatfafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l44o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter.

Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021480.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o4 3536o39, Page5do of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v.

Cause challenges are generally based on one of\nthree species of bias: (l) actual bias, or \"bias in fact\"; (2) implied bias, or bias that\nis \"presumed as a mater of law\" where a typical person in the juror's position would\nbe biased, irrespective of whether actual bias exists; and (3) inferable bias, which\narises \"When a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently\nsignificant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause,\nbut not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.\" 285 F.3d at l7l-l72.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021775.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page33 of 35\nl892. But Kimberly Espinoza did. /d. In fact, according to Espinoza, by the time\nKellen began working for Epstein in 2ool-2oo2, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein “went\ntheir separate ways” (Tr. 237o) and Kellen sat in the office where Ms. Maxwell used\nto sit and managed Epstein’s properties. Tr. 2337, 237o-7l, 2375-6, 2382. Carolyn\ncorroborates this fact when she testified that there was a clean break in time between\nwhen she dealt with Maxwell and when she dealt with Kellen. Tr. l527.

Alternatively, for the\nreasons stated in Point I, the mater should be remanded to the District Court for a\nhearing.

See Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 67l; Alessi, 544 F.2d at ll54; Papa, 533 F.2d at 823-25. That is not the\ncase here. Appellant produced ample evidence that the NPA was intended to bind\nother USAOs.

Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 47o (affidavits “recount[ing]\nhearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence” are not <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to\njustify discovery); Berrios, 5ol F.2d at l2ll (affidavit from defendant and atorney that they\n“‘believe[d]” there was improper motive and that “hundreds” of similarly situated individuals went\nunprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 34l F.3d at l74 (defendant’s statistical analysis was\ninsufficient to merit discovery on selective prosecution claim).\n\nDe Discussion\n\nThomas is not entitled to discovery that would relate to a selective procession or\n“discriminatory application” claim. He has not carried his burden through a shouing of any\nevidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.\n\nAs to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any\nevidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of\nconduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].” Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal\nquotation marks omited). “A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who\nhas commited roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom\nthe law has not been enforced.” United States v. Lewis, 5l7 F.3d 2o, 27 (lst Cir. 2oo8). Thomas\nalleges that there was an “almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6 wherein officers failed to\nconduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide,” and one of the four\nofficers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to\nconduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts.

In any event, even were the conduct similar,\nthat Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally\nprosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, Thomas points to the fact that “Officer-l” and “Officer-2” in the Indictment,\nwho falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. institutional counts on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, respectively, were not prosecuted. (Mot. lo; Ind. ¥[ l5, l7, l9). Even assuming\narguendo that Officer-l and Officer-2 were similarly situated to Thomas in that they each falsified\none count slip—while Thomas falsified three—Thomas has failed to put forth any evidence that\neither Officer-l or Officer-2 were outside of a “protected class” to which Thomas belongs.’ Nor\ncould he: Officer-l and Officer-2 are the same race, gender, and nationality as Thomas. Thomas\nalso questions why his supervisors or other MCC personnel who received and reviewed Thomas’s\nfalse count slips were not also prosecuted with making false statements, but those supervisors or\npersonnel are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false\nstatements—Thomas did. In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the “suspicion [and]\nsurmise” contained in Thomas’s motion simply do not constitute “objective evidence” warranting\ndiscovery. See United States v. White, 972 F.2d l6, l9 (2d Cir. l992) (conclusory allegations as to\ntiming of indictment, Government’s failure to follou internal guidelines, and improprieties of\n\nT Tn so noting, the Government does not intend to comment on its deliberative process or\nthe exercise of its prosecutorial discretion.

Motion at 6. Houever, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the\nGovernment reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation. Nor has he shoun that\nBOP officials “participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews,” were “involved in\npresenting the case to the grand jury,” “reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents\nwith the prosecution,” “played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy,”\n“accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings,” or in any other way played a role in the\ninvestigation that led to the charges against him. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal\nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omited). There is, therefore, no evidence that BOP\npersonnel participated in the criminal investigation that led to Thomas’ indictment. Thus, the\nCourt concludes that the BOP was not part of the prosecution team for purposes of Rule l6 and\nBrady.\n\nTo be sure, the BOP is a component of the Department of Justice, but that fact standing\nalone is not <span class=\"highlight\">sufficient</span> to make the BOP an arm of the prosecution. “The court cannot find that\n' Because the Court denies Thomas’ motion on the ground that no material exists to disclose, it does not address\nwhether the Inspector General’s report might contain information material to his defense, nor whether it ls protected\nby the deliberative process privilege.
