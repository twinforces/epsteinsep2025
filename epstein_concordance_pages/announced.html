This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison.

To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difterence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo993", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001167.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeaGeck 5 Ob 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.’ The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation.

Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6.

Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

When a non-prosecution decision is\nconveyed in such a way, and when a defendant, having no indication to the contrary,\ndetrimentally relies upon that decision, due process may warrant preclusion of the\nprosecution.

There has been considerable debate over the\nlegal significance of District Atorney Castor’s publicly <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> decision not to\nprosecute Cosby in 2oo5. Before the trial court, the Superior Court, and nou this Court,\nthe parties have vigorously disputed whether D.A. Castor and Cosby reached a binding\nagreement, whether D.A. Castor extended an enforceable promise, or whether any act of\nlegal significance occurred at all. There is testimony in the record that could support any\nof these conclusions. The trial court—the entity charged with sorting through those\nfacts—found that D.A. Castor made no agreement or overt promise.\n\nMuch of that debate, and the atendant factual conclusions, were based upon the\napparent absence of a formal agreement and former D.A. Castor’s various efforts to\ndefend and explain his actions ten years after the fact. As a reviewing court, we accept\nthe trial court’s conclusion that the district atorney's decision was merely an exercise of\nhis charging discretion.24 As we assess whether that decision, and the surrounding\nmA The dissent agrees—as do we —with the trial court’s conclusion that D.A. Castor’s\ndecision not to prosecute was, at its core, an exercise of the inherent charging discretion\nvested in district atorneys. See D.O. at l. But the dissent would simply end the analysis\nthere. In the dissent’s view, once a decision is deemed to fall within a prosecutor’s\ndiscretion, that decision “in no way” can bind the actions of future elected prosecutors.\nRespectfully, this perspective overlooks the verity that not all decisions are the same. As\nto routine discretionary decisions, the dissent may be correct. But as we explain\nthroughout this opinion, what occurred here was anything but routine. Here, D.A. Castor’s\nexercise of discretion was made deliberately to induce the deprivation of a fundamental\nright. The typical decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute, is not made for the purpose\nof extracting incriminating information from a suspect when there exists no other\nmechanism to do so.\n\nThe dissent would amalgamate and confine all “present exercise[s] of prosecutorial\ndiscretion” within a single, non-binding, unenforceable, and unreviewable category. /d.\nWe decline to endorse this blanket approach, as such decisions merit, and indeed require,\nindividualized evaluation. To rule otherwise would authorize, if not encourage,\nprosecutors to choose temporarily not to prosecute, obtain incriminating evidence from\nthe suspect, and then reverse course with impunity. Due process necessarily requires\nthat court officials, particularly prosecutors, be held to a higher standard.

Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\nprosecute Cosby. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span>\nthat he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

Castor\n<span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.\nNothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to prosecute Cosby. The trial court’s\nconclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of Cosby’s reliance was his\ncounseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the\nStates via incorporation though the Fourteenth Amendment, commands that “[n]o person\n... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. CONST.\namend.

Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony.

Thereafter, in announcing the arrest of\nGhislaine Maxwell at a choreographed press conference on July 2, 2o2o, Acting United States\nAtorney Audrey Strauss boldly <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span>: “This case against Ghislaine Maxwell is the prequel\nto the earlier case we brought against Jeffrey Epstein.” See htps://youtu.be/hGAsZthBKCE.\n\nThe defense is entitled to elicit this evidence, as well as evidence of the public outcry and\nmedia scrutiny that folloued the Miami Herald articles and Epstein’s death, to argue that the\ngovernment initially focused the New York investigation on Epstein and charged only him in the\ninitial July 2, 2ol9 indictment in order to rectify the perceived injustice that the NPA was a\n“sweetheart deal” for Epstein. When Epstein died, houever, the government had to scramble to\nquickly build a case against his purported co-conspirators, including Ms. Maxwell. The defense\nis further entitled to argue that the public pressure to charge Epstein’s co-conspirators and the\natendant focus on Ms. Maxwell caused the government to engage in a hasty and sloppy\ninvestigation in which they ignored inconsistencies in the evidence, accepted the witness’\nstatements at face value without testing them or verifying them with corroborating evidence, and\ngenerally exhibited a “remarkably uncritical atitude” to the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\nKyles at 445, 448 (police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\n*l 8/l2/2ol9 Remarks of Atorney General William Barr to the Fraternal Order of Police (New Orleans,\nLA, Aug. l2, 2ol9) available at htps://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/atorney-general-william-p-\nbarr-delivers-remarks-grand-lodge-fraternal-order-polices-64th.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6459", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 2of2l\norder to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn\nstatements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available\non the current record.\n\nAccordingly, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48.

To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored.

Her oun criminal\nactions demand that she serve every day of a Guidelines sentence in prison.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York opened its investigation\ninto Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators in late November 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by investigative journalism, and not, as the defendant claims, by civil litigants who\npressed for criminal charges. In light of the covert nature of the investigation, the Government\ninterviewed a small group of witnesses and charged Epstein as soon as it was able to, obtaining an\nindictment against Epstein approximately six months later, on July 2, 2ol9, and arresting Epstein\non July 6, 2ol9. (PSR ¥ 2l). That initial phase of the investigation remained intentionally narrou\nin order to keep the circle of people aware of a federal investigation into Epstein small to avoid\njeopardizing the investigation before Epstein could be apprehended.\n\nThe Government’s investigation expanded upon charging Epstein, and several additional\nvictims came forward after the charges were <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span>. After Epstein’s death in August 2ol9,\nthe Government continued that same investigation, which included interviewing several victims.\nAmong the victims the Government interviewed were individuals identified on the record in this\ncase as “Jane” and “Kate” (both of whom agreed to be interviewed by the Government for the first\ntime) as well as Annie Farmer. The Government obtained the original Indictment against the\ndefendant—which related to the abuse of Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer—in late June 2o2o. In\nMarch 2o2l, the Government obtained a superseding indictment charging the defendant—which\nadded counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor victim, Carolyn—based on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo54o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Page4ofl6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Four\n2o2o, the U.S. Virgin Islands probate court approved the EVCP as designed.'* On June 25,\n2o2o, the EVCP <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> that individuals could begin the process of filing claims.!°\n\nIn her motion seeking approval for the subpoena, Maxwell makes at least two\nmischaracterizations of the Protocol for evaluating a claimant’s eligibility for compensation.\nFirst, she says that the Protocol “credits” victims “who have had charges filed against Epstein or\nany employee of Epstein.”'© The Protocol does no such thing.

Biros today <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> that the Co-Executors\nof the Estate of Jeffrey E.

Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints.

Feldman, <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein.

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\n<span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool99lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019911.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8ooB8oHAEN ISACuMEent 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPageb26ol9\nmake purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span>\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difterence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool99ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020085.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBGlANt DEctuMerf loo2 Filed6Ra38/?tgPageP Staf 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span>\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).!°> Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI.

The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2 Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span>\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023167.jpg": "when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nl37 The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023483.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 2 of 3\nIn April of this year, BOP’s leadership <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> ts new mission as \"corrections professionals\nwho foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals\nfor successful reentry into our communities.\" BOP’s new core values include accountability,\nintegrity, respect, compassion, and correctional excellence. Of note, our core value of\naccountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public,\nourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,\nand the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is commited to\nproviding a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.\nRecommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate\nfollouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in\ncustody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.\nOur practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved\nand overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP\nhas updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP’s\nrevised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists\nmake individualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial\nconcerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees\nwork collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\nappropriately.\nRecommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for\nsuicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate\nre-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023489.jpg": "<u Of >\nCS on\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL\nJune 27, 2o23\nDO] OIG Releases Report on the BOP’s Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan\nCorrectional Center in New York, New York\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horouitz <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> today the release of a report\nof investigation regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey\nEpstein while detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New\nYork). Epstein died by suicide on August lo, 2ol9 while in BOP custody. The focus of DO] Office of the\nInspector General's (OIG) investigation was the conduct of BOP personnel.\nThe DO] OIG investigation and review identified:\n\ne Numerous and Serious Failures by MCC New York Staff. The DO) OIG found numerous and serious\nfailures by MCC New York staff constituting misconduct and dereliction of their duties. Among other\nthings, these failures resulted in Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excessive\namount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in\nhis locked cell on August lo at approximately 6:3o a.m.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Follouing a July 23,\n2ol9, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York\nPsychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate\ncellmate. On August 9, Epstein’s cell mate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York\nstaff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was\nassigned a new cellmate.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein\nand Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,\nand ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s\ndeath failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was\ndocumented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when\nEpstein’s cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would\nhave revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell. The OIG\nalso found that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after about lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:oo p.m. on\nAugust 9. MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to shou that they had been\nperformed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his\ndeath. Follouing a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged\ncriminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the\nemployees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S.\nAtorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

I spoke with Mark Zeff, of\n5l5 W 2oth Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for\nMr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2oo5 to\ndo’a complete overhaul on the house.

Mr. Zeff advised,\nhis contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never\nwitnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, Sara or\nNada. :\nI then interviewed Daniel Estes, of 3l5 Fast l4th Street in New York.\nMr. Estes stated he has worked for Zeff for seven years. He advised\nhe personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr.\nEpstein. He has previously met with Sara and Adrianna, Epstein's\nassistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with\nEpstein everywhere he goes.\nI interviewed Zara Bailey of 35 Riverside Jersey City, New Jersey.\nBailey stated she just arrived from Scotland and: has worked with Zeff\nfor only one month. She stated she has never met Epstein and has not\nseen him. The interview was then concluded.\nI then spoke with Douglas Schoetle of 243 Riverside Dr in New York\nCity.

Schoetle stated he mainly speaks\nwith Sara Kellen, Epstein s main assistant, who travels with Epstein.\nSchoetle stated he only has contact with Epstein when his services\nare needed.\nAt approximately lo:3o am, I was informed that the videotaping was\nconcluded. I entered the residence and located two covert (hidden)\ncameras.

The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span>\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023167.tif": "when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.’’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and <span class=\"highlight\">announced</span> in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nl97 The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030275.tif": "Case 9:o8-cv-8oll9-KAM Document 3o5 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/l7/2oo9 Page 3 of 8\n. : 9.
