I think that's probably the central issue\n\n5 for the sentencing proceeding.\n\n6 We do agree -- there's no way we can disagree -- that\n7 Ms. Days does have several prior convictions.

He (our father) was a pouerful\nand dominant figure. And as elder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine\nunder his wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and vulnerable\nto his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and rejections. This led her to\nbecoming very vulnerable to abusive andpouerful men who would be able to\ntake advantage of her innate good nature.\nIt is striking that Ghislaine did not shou any perverse behaviour before she met\nEpstein. Nor did she shou any after leaving him, which she eventually managed\nto do. The effect of our father's psychologically abusive treatment of her,\nforeshadoued Epstein's oun ability to exploit, manipulate and control her.\n\nExhibit A.\n\nAnother psychotherapist and family friend of some 55 years, James Martin Hollomon,\n\nrecalls his observations of Ghislaine’s father:\n[T]heir father was narcissistic, demanding and highly controlling. He let\nthem knou early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity. So,\nall the kids knew they had to \"make it on their oun\" despite the wealth and\nprivilege in which they were grouing up. As I got to knou each of these kids,\nincluding Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one worked very\nhard at their jobs, as Bob wouldn't bear any idleness, and each strove for their\nfather's and mother's respect through their intelligence and their oun hard work.\n\nExhibit B.\n\nHer twin sisters, Christine Malina Maxwell and Isabel Maxwell, atest to Ghislaine’s\n\nwork ethic:\n[W]e were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was notalways perfect.\nUnfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother\nMichaelwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he\nremained in a coma until his death when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite\nof this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to adapt and to become a <span class=\"highlight\">productive</span>\nand caring human being.\n[B]oth of our parents had an incredible work ethic. We were all encouraged\nfrom an early age to work to earn money and to respect the responsibility\nthat came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in Ghislaine.\nGhislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her positions\ndemanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills,\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo46l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 48 of 77\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nMay 2, 2o22\nTo Honorable Judge Nathan:\nMy name is Christine Malina Maxwell. | am one of Ghislaine’s sisters. I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a <span class=\"highlight\">productive</span> and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l5 of 264 42l\nLClVMAXl\n\nl MS.
