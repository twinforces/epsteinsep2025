Ms. Maxwell can impeach a prosecution witness’s testimony with any\nadmissible exhibit. The decision in United States v. Hatfield makes this clear.\n\nIn Hatfield, the government sought a Rule l6(b)(l)(A) order compelling the defendant to\ndisclose six categories of evidence:\n\n(l) the Tactical Armor Products, Inc. computers and servers, as described in the\n\ntestimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2oo8; (2) all computers of DHB Industries, Inc.,\n\nas described in the testimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2oo8; (3) all computers\n\npersonally used by and/or issued to David H.

Hatfield, No. o6-CR-o55o, 2oo9 WL lo6736l9, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2oo9).\nThe district court refused the government’s request, as should this Court. As Judge Seybert\nexplained:\n\nBecause [the defendant] will not be using these items to support his case in chief,\n\n[he] is not required to disclose the items under Rule l6....\n\nThe Court rejects the Government’s argument that [the defendant] is\nrequired to turn over the above documents pursuant to Rule l6 because [the\ndefendant] may use the items to impeach Government witnesses. Rule l6 mandates\ndisclosure of any documents and tangible objects that the defendant will use in his\ncase-in-chief, and not items which the defendant will use to impeach witnesses.\n\nHatfield, 2oo9 WL lo6736l9, at *l-2 (citing Medearis & Moore) (full citations omited).
