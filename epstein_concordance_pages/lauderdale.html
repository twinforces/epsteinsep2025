Epstein, l9-cr-49o (RMB) and U.S. v.\nMaxwell, 2o-cr-33o (PAE)\nDear Judges Berman and Engelmayer,\n\nWe write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from\nthe Department of Justice on July 25, 2o25, advising that the Court is seeking leters on behalf of\nvictims seting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s grand jury transcripts.!\n\nBy the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s actions. To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n\n‘Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.\n\n?

Jeffrey Epstein\nCase No.: l9 CR 49o (RMB)\nDear Judge Berman:\nWe represent numerous survivors of Jeffrey Epstein, including several individuals whose names and\nidentifying information appear in the subject materials. In that vein, we write to address the\nDepartment of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials and to respectfully urge the Court to\nadminister any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the victims’ rights under the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (““CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, the enduring interests protected by Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent.\nI. Victims’ CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context—\nNot in a Vacuum\nThe CVRA guarantees victims:\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo77l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000774.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 4of4\nHonorable Richard M.

Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured\nprofound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the\nyears follouing. To nou compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—\nespecially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the leter and the spirit of\nthe CVRA.\nThe CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point touard narrou tailoring, maximal\nprivacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight.\nWe respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.\nRespectfully submited,\nBradley Edwards\nBritany Henderson\nEDWARDS HENDERSON\n425 North Andrews Avenue, Suite 2\nFort <span class=\"highlight\">Lauderdale</span>, Florida 333ol\nTelephone: (954) 524-282o\nEmail: brad@cvlf.com\n\nbritany@cvlf.com\nPaul G.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nRule l7 Subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write on behalf of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) in further support of its objections\nto Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s motion for an order authorizing a subpoena to BSF pursuant to\nRule l7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the “Subpoena”).! As the Defendant’s\nresponse makes clear, she seeks to serve a Rule l7 subpoena on BSF because she is dissatisfied\nwith the Government’s discovery efforts thus far. Thus, she is using Rule l7 to atempt to obtain\ndiscovery that she has been unable to obtain from the Government under Rule l6 and Brady,\nincluding discovery that is subject to a pending motion before the Court. This is an improper use\nof a Rule l7 subpoena. If the Defendant believes that the Government has not fulfilled its\ndiscovery obligations under Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio, she must address that issue with the\nGovernment and the Court rather than serving overbroad and burdensome subpoenas on third\nparties. And if the Defendant is not entitled to the discovery she seeks from the Government, then\n: The Defendant refers to BSF’s objections as a “motion to quash,” but the Court has not yet\ngranted Defendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena to BSF. BSF thus requests that the\nDefendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena be denied.\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort <span class=\"highlight\">Lauderdale</span>, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 8954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ool\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004213.jpg": "Casask lg -Qn8IaRARW SPasuauenemehes FidecbeWmeMs! pdgacerts afl2\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nI certify that on June 6, 2ol6, I electronically served this Defendant's Response in Opposition to\nMotion to Exceed Presumptive Ten Deposition Limit via ECF on the follouing:\nSigrid S.

First, as a mater of fact, Government Exhibit 52 was not something that\nthe cooperating government witness reviewed, used, or saw during her brief employment with\nJeffrey Epstein. Records produced in discovery reflect that witness began working for Epstein in\nME At that point, the suspect source of Government Exhibit 52, Alfredo Rodriguez, was not\nemployed by Epstein because he had been fired in 2oo4.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rodriguez, when he left the Epstein home he took an address book,\nwhich he claimed was Epstein’s book, and had it in his possession until 2oo9 when he tried to\nsell it to Brad Edwards for $5o,ooo.'

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAnnie Farmer submits the follouing statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed\n\nmotion for bail.\nis 2K 3\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this mater and once more\nrequest that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort <span class=\"highlight\">Lauderdale</span>, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020391.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Paged of 9l\nHighest Offense Level\n(Terminated)\nFelony\nComplaints Disposition\nNone\nInterested Party\nReporters Commitee for Freedom of represented by Katielynn Boyd Tounsend\nthe Press Reporters Commitee For Freedom of The\nPress\nll56 l5th Street NW Suite lo2o\nWashington, DC 2ooo5\n2o2-795-93oo\nFax: 2o2—795—93 lo\nEmail: ktounsend@rctp.org\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Retained\nIntervenor\nBoies Schiller Flexner LLP represented by David Boies , I\nAnd the Victims it Represents Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP (Armonk)\n333 Main Street\nArmonk, NY lo5o4\n(9l4)—749-82oo\nFax: (9l4)-749-83oo\nEmail: dboies@bsfllp.com\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Retained\nSigrid S.

Edwards said the later action “eviscerated the\nrights” of the two women te bring Epstein to justice.\nAssistant U.S. Atorney Dexter Lee told Marra that the Crime Victims’\nRights Act dictates that victim notification is triggered only affer an\nindictment.\nCassell disagreed. “It wasn’t designed to be so narrouly\ncircumscribed,” the Fort <span class=\"highlight\">Lauderdale</span> lawyer said.\nLee said requiring federal atorneys to confer with alleged victims\nbefore they can determine whether an indictment is warranted would\nimpinge on prosecutorial discretion. “The government believes these\nrights would atach only after a formal indictment,” Lee said.\nMarra questioned that assertion. “I think we wouldn’t be here if your\noffice had conferred with the victims, heard them out,” and explained\nwhy prosecution wasn’t pursued, the judge said.\nLee countered that alleged victims have no right to confer with the\ngovernment when the government is not “in the case.”\nThe judge reserved ruling on the plaintiffs’ motion to unseal the\nfederal atorneys’ plea deal correspondence with Epstein’s legal\nteam.\nHe gave famed criminal defense atorney Roy Black two weeks to\nsubmit materials explaining why the leters should not be turned over\nto the two young women’s lawyers. The U.S. Atorney's Office will\nthen have two weeks to respond, then the plaintiffs’ team will have a\nweek to respond. Black will then have a week to deliver his final reply\nto the judge.\nBlack had argued that the correspondence was protected by atorney\n-client privilege. “Any statements made in regard to plea bargaining\nare immunized” whether related to statements of culpability or not,\nBlack said. “This is classic work product we sent to the government.”\n\nCOMMENTS\n. . ; ; o3956-l295\nhtp:/Avww.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/sides-argue-whether-jeffrey-epsteins-nonprose... 8/l9/Zoll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030111.tif": ".

All Rights Reserved)\nPAGE SIX'S scoop last month that mysterious money manager Jeffrey Epstein had floun Bill Clinton, Chris\nTucker and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his private 727 has sent journalists all over toun trying to find out just who\nEpstein really is.\nVanity Fair has a reporter on his trail, but New York magazine beats them to the punch with a feature this week\non Epstein's strange history.\nEpstein, 49, a former Dalton School math teacher from Coney Island, is said to manage $l5 billion for super-\nwealthy clients he'll only take on if they have at least $l billion in assets.\n\"According to people who knou him,\" New York reports, “if you were worth $7oo million and felt the need for the\nservices of Epstein & Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you.”\nNoted mergers/acquisitions lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft recalls trying to give\nEpstein a client whose funds were belou the $l billion cutoff.\n\"| sent him a $5oo million client a few years ago and he wouldn't take him,\" Block reports. \"Said the account was\ntoo small. Both the client and | were amazed. But that's Jeffrey.\"\nMost Wall Streeters, houever, aren't even certain what Epstein actually does for a living. \"My belief is that Jeff\nmaintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him,\" says one\npouerful investor. \"He once told me that he has 3oo people working for him, and I've also heard he manages\nRockefeller money. But one never knous. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz.\"\nSome say that Epstein once quit his seat on the board of the Rockefeller Institute because he hates wearing a\nsuit, Supposedly telling a friend, \"It feels like wearing a dress.\"\nhtp://pqapepAarchiver.com/ny post/22249393 | .htpyleMAGsodb3 73aedch l qi par atRodequedr KOU PMS\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032084.jpg": "td CMLL YY Oe AYY YY 2 EIN A WUE - <p. - ~--\n\nSEAN \"Puffy\" Combs confirmed our account of hou Heath Ledger scuffled with his bodyguards at the\nVHl/Vogue Awards after-party Combs threw at Lotus. \"Heath is from Australia, and he parties hard nou,\"\nCombs told \"Access Hollywood.\" The two became pals on the set of \"Monster's Ball.\" \"He's coming at me, he's\nlike, 'Puff, people don't knou that we're the best of friends,’ so it's like my security held him up for a second...\nand | was like, 'No, that's my brother.'\" Sins of his grandfather\n\"DISCO Bloodbath\" author James St. James is follouing up his notorious tell-all about killer club kid Michael Alig\nwith another true-crime tome.
