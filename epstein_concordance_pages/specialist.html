Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 348\nor other divisions having responsibility for specific criminal enforcement, such as the Civil Rights\nDivision.

In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which involve this matier, please contact the offics listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> with each victim, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.>!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?° The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3423", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also recetved a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 252 of 348\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”>°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --.. .\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.*4° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\na? Villafafia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3428", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 253 of 348\nprosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the\nplea was entered on June 3o, 2oo8.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims,\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nFrom my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it\n\nwas an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment. You\n\nknou, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal\n\nprocess],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a\n\nfederal indictment and a federal trial.

February — March 2oo8: Villafatia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n3. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3429", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out ina leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised.\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 276 of 348\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span> and other key officials.

The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners. Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l8.\n\n4o9 Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l9, l22l.\n26l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3463", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 288 of 348\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l4 of 348\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 227 of 349\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> with each victim, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the\nconclusion, or. . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4524", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 239 of 349\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4545", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 249 of 349\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, ““The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4546", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 253 of 349\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”**?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --...\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.*4° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted.

February — March 2oo8: Villafaia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n3. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-oooo455l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 265 of 349\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 277 of 349\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span> and other key officials.

The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

Supp. 3d at l2l9, l22l.\n26l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4585", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 289 of 349\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4586", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l5 of 349\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

Robert Kelso and John Lopez\nThe defendant anticipates calling Robert Kelso, a computer forensics <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span>, to testify\nabout:\nthe user data associated with certain devices seized and\nsearched by the government’s team in this case, documents\nand photographs extracted from certain of those devices, and\nthe metadata associated with certain documents and\nphotographs.

Specifically, Mr. Lopez will discuss\nvarious transfers of funds that are reflected in the financial\nrecords and explain the information contained in the financial\nrecords regarding those transfers.\n(Id. at l3).\nTo the extent Kelso and Lopez are expected to summarize evidence otherwise in the record,\nthat testimony is not expert testimony, and therefore its admission is not precluded by Rule 7o2.\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008067.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7 Filed ll/24/2l Page 26 of 28\n\nAccordingly, the Court should preclude expert testimony from Kelso and Lopez unless and\nuntil the defense to provides supplemental expert notice forthwith.!* If the defense does so, the\nGovernment should have an opportunity at that time to litigate its admissibility.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> assumes responsibility for victim notification.?”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l395", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021396.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 399 3536o38, Page224 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span>....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 356. 3536o38, Page228 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\n\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> with each victim, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 - SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021412.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 338 3536o38, Page24o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.3!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.3!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\ncae Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021421.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 347 3536o38, Page249 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.’329\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”°?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update.

The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.°?* The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8.\nPat Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021422.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 348 3536o38, Page25o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open... it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n32o CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021426.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 38D 3536o38, Page254 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 252 of 348\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “‘never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”3°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point Ijust felt... like it was nonexistent.

The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted.

Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*'° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.‘! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\nao The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n4d The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\nae Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included\nthe individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails. CEOS also conducted a check of\nits shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.\n\n5. Office of the Deputy Atorney General Records\n\nOPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the\nformer Deputy Atorney General.

The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.

THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2l3 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023236.jpg": "iFyoc have additental questions whieh ivalve thes ater, please contact (he office lisled above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?’\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\naio OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.jpg": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?””\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\nAaT Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n28 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023238.jpg": "[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> with each victim, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or . . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23238", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023250.jpg": "NPA.?!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3lo Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2325o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023259.jpg": "“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\nPa The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n328 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl28 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\nad Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023260.jpg": "We will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\n\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\n\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2326o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023264.jpg": "for him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”**?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --...\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.*4° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\n\n339 Villafafia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023265.jpg": "prosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the\nplea was entered on June 3o, 2oo8.\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims,\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nFrom my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it\n\nwas an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment. You\n\nknou, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal\n\nprocess],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a\n\nfederal indictment and a federal trial.

February — March 2oo8: Villafaia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n3. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23265", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023276.jpg": "l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

(Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\na7 A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23276", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023288.jpg": "service providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span> and other key officials.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\nal The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nal2 Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023326.jpg": "Atorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained. The USAO’s\ndata was migrated between March and June 2oo8.\n\nEOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any\nadditional emails. OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation.

In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> l said that Inmate l, who appeared shaken up, told him that he had\nbeen asleep on the floor of the cell and was awoken when he felt Epstein land on him. Senior Officer\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the\nControl Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> l entered the cell, where they\nsecured and removed Epstein’s cellmate. Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> l reported that he then reentered the\ncell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> l said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was atached to the\nbunkbed ladder in the cell. Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> l said that Epstein was siting on the floor of the cell\nwith his back against the bunkbed ladder. Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> l's report said that Epstein was\nbreathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant and other staff arrived. Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> l confirmed in his OIG interview that they\nstarted cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU,\nshe saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and\nboxers. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no\nfurther injuries. She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring. The COs\nunsuccessfully tried to get Epstein to stand on his oun, and then placed him on a stretcher and took him to\nthe Health Services Unit.\nAccording to BOP records, at approximately l:4o a.m., Epstein was transferred out of the SHU and placed on\nsuicide watch. As previously noted in Chapter 2, inmates on suicide watch are housed in a dedicated room,\ntypically in the health services area, where they are continuously monitored by specially trained staff\nor inmates.\nSenior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 3 documented in a BOP report that when he and others responded to the call for\nassistance and gained access to the SHU, he saw Epstein lying on the floor of his cell snoring. He and the\nother officers verbally instructed Epstein to stand up, but Epstein did not. He and other officers then lifted\nEpstein onto a stretcher to remove him from the cell.\nSenior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 4 wrote in a BOP report that he responded to a body alarm in the SHU and helped\nremove Epstein from his cell, placed him on a stretcher, and took him to the second floor for a medical\nassessment. Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 4 further reported that, while he was observing Epstein in the Health\nServices Unit, Epstein told Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 4 that he thought his cellmate had tried to kill him.\nEpstein further stated that his cellmate had tried to extort him and that for the last week his cellmate had\nthreatened to beat him if he did not pay him.

Inmate l said he called out to Epstein and when Epstein did not answer, he got up, turned on\nthe light, and saw Epstein siting on the floor, leaning to the side with a string around his neck.

Inmate l provided a similar\nstatement to BOP officials at approximately 2:5o p.m. on July 23, 2ol9.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant’s report notes that she also spoke with Epstein, who told her that\nhe had returned to his cell after an atorney visit at approximately 8 p.m. the previous day, at which time his\ncellmate was reading the Daily News newspaper. Epstein’s said his cellmate turned to a page of the\nnewspaper that had Epstein’s picture and reported that Epstein was worth $77 million. Epstein told the\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he looked at his picture, balled it up, and threw it in the garbage.\nEpstein further stated that he woke up at approximately l a.m. to get a drink of water, returned to his bunk,\nand the next thing he remembered was that he was snoring and MCC New York staff were inside his cell.\nWhen asked about the allegations against his cellmate, Epstein said he had been told that if his cellmate\nhurt him, MCC New York staff would not care.\nInmate 2, who was housed in the same SHU tier as Epstein on July 23, told the FBI about an incident that\noccurred in the SHU around l:2o a.m. to l:3o a.m. on an unspecified date. Inmate 2 said he was reading a\nbook when he heard an inmate scream and bang on the cell door to get the SHU officers’ atention.\nInmate 2 said he could only see the cell door and not inside. According to Inmate 2, Senior Officer\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 2 responded to the cell and then left and returned with additional officers. The FBI was further\ntold by Inmate 2 that the officers opened the cell door, removed an inmate, placed the inmate in handcuffs,\nand put the inmate in the shouer area. Inmate 2 stated that the officers reentered the cell and Inmate 2\nheard a thump as if something had hit the floor. The officers then pulled the other inmate out of the cell,\nplaced him on a stretcher, and took him away. Inmate 2 also told the FBI that, later in the evening, around\n2:lo a.m. to 2:l5 a.m., the COs returned to the cell where the incident had occurred earlier. He said he\nfurther observed the officers clean out the cell and use a video camera to record the inside of the cell.\nInmate 2 said he saw the officers remove from the cell orange clothing items that had been tied together.\nInmate 2 also said that the first inmate to be removed from the cell later told Inmate 2 that he was sleeping\nwhen his cellmate had tried to kill himself by hanging himself from the ladder of the bed.\nAccording to BOP records, medical staff evaluated Epstein at approximately 6:2o a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, and\nobserved friction marks and superficial reddening of his neck and one knee. The red mark spanned two-\nthirds of Epstein’s neck (front and sides) and was 2 inches wide. Epstein told the medical staff that he did\nnot knou what had caused his injuries, and that he went to drink a litle water and woke up snoring.\nLater that morning, the MCC New York Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment and\ndetermined that Epstein should remain on suicide watch. During the assessment, Epstein denied any\nknouledge of hou he sustained the marks on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted in the assessment\nreport that it was unclear whether Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if someone else did.\nMedical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m. the follouing day, July 24, 2ol9, and observed\nthat the central part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion.

The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych Observation and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\ncompleted a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on\nmultiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and atentive about Epstein’s special needs.\nAccording to Associate Warden l, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.\nAssociate Warden l said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant\nshould have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement.

Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York\nAccording to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2ol9, at\napproximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC\nNew York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts.\nThe Supervisory Correctional Systems <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023420.jpg": "D.

The SHU Lieutenant, whose shift\nended over an hour before the USMS sent the second email regarding Inmate 3's impending transfer, told\nthe OIG he was not aware that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred out of MCC New York, and\ntherefore he did not notify the Captain that Epstein would require a new cellmate. According to the SHU\nLieutenant, as soon as the SHU staff learned that Inmate 3 would be transferred, they should have notified a\nLieutenant on duty. The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the\nOIG that on August 9, 2ol9, they had oversight of the SHU from approximately 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. due to\ntheir position descriptions and because of the SHU Lieutenant’s absence.\nAccording to the MCC New York Staff Roster, on August 9, 2ol9, SHU Officer #l was listed as Senior Officer\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 5.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a\ncellmate.

He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted\nEpstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time\nEpstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were\naccompanied by CO l, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge and CO l both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his\nbelongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that\nhe would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a\ncellmate. In his interview with the OIG, CO l confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications\nmade either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the\nOIG that when he and CO l left the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants’\nOffice and should have seen that Inmate 3 was departing the institution when they passed the office.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York,\nthere had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal,\nonly to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances.

According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU\nthat evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said\nSHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein. In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate.

According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, everyone who regularly\nworked in the SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate. The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou Inmate 3 had left MCC New York earlier that day\nand was unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate. He said that if Inmate 3 had been transported to\nReceiving and Discharge as “WAB\"” and the SHU Lieutenant was off, then another supervisor should have\nbeen notified. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that SHU personnel assigned to his\nshift should have notified him that Epstein was without a cellmate, but he had not been informed. The OIG’s\ninvestigation revealed, houever, that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant was one of the recipients of\nthe USMS email notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC\nNew York on August 9. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant conducted the Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9, and she only would have\nknoun that Epstein was without a cell mate if someone from the SHU told her or if she walked through the\nSHU tiers during the round. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he believed that if the Evening\nWatch Acting Activities Lieutenant knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate, she would have notified him.\nBoth the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the\nOIG that they were unaware that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. The Acting Evening Watch Activities\nLieutenant, who was serving in this position on August 9 from approximately 4 p.m. until lo p.m., told the\nOIG that because her ordinary position was a Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, she was not aware that Epstein was\nrequired to have a cellmate.

The\nUnit Manager said he put Epstein in the shouer area to make the telephone call because COs were present\nin that area. The Unit Manager explained that he also chose the shouer area because that location ensured\nEpstein would not be able to pull the phone cord into his cell and use it to harm himself. The Unit Manager\nsaid he plugged the telephone line into the legal line, which was not recorded, and dialed the telephone\nnumber that Epstein provided. As noted above, the number that was dialed was in the local 646 area code.\nThe Unit Manager said he alloued Epstein to place the telephone call on the unrecorded legal line because\nhe believed that Epstein had not set up his Inmate Telephone System account that would have alloued him\nto call on the institutions recorded lines. According to the Unit Manager, a male answered, and the Unit\nManager handed the receiver to Epstein. The Unit Manager heard Epstein say, “Hey, hou are you doing?\nHou's everything?” The Unit Manager admited that he should have verified who was on the line, as Epstein\nhad requested to make a telephone call to speak with his mother, and it was a male who answered the\nphone. The Unit Manager said he could not verify the phone number because he believed that Epstein did\nnot have his Inmate Telephone System account set up, and he did not have any phone numbers associated\nwith his account. The Unit Manager told the OIG that after he handed the telephone to Epstein, his shift\nended so he left the SHU and left MCC New York for the day.\nThe Unit Manager said that when he left the SHU, Epstein was still on the call and the Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Noel were at the officers’ desk, and that Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> l was also present.\nAccording to the Unit Manager, when he was leaving, he told the officers, “Hey, make sure he gets his l5-\nminutes, and after that, he’s done.” The Unit Manager said he did not provide the SHU staff with\ninstructions to monitor the call. He said that after he left, he contacted Noel on the SHU telephone and\nasked her to make sure that Epstein’s call had ended because his time was up.\nThe Unit Manager acknouledged that he did not stay and monitor the call as he should have done. The Unit\nManager said the proper way to have an inmate place a telephone call on an unmonitored line would be to\nbring the inmate out and place him in a belly chain because then he would be handcuffed in the front. The\nUnit Manager said he should have provided Epstein with the phone, with a counselor or unit team member\npresent, and placed the call on speaker so the call was monitored.\nThe OIG investigation determined that Epstein did not, in fact, speak with his mother, who, according to\npublic records, died in 2oo4. The OIG found that Epstein actually spoke with Individual l, who declined to be\ninterviewed by the OIG.*?

The OIG investigation determined that the legal line is an unrecorded telephone line outside\nof the Inmate Telephone System, which is designed for inmates to use when speaking with their counsel and\ntherefore is not recorded. Noel said that after the Unit Manager set Epstein up with the call, he left the SHU\nand did not instruct Noel, or anyone else to Noel’s knouledge, to monitor Epstein’s call. According to Noel,\nthe call was not monitored or logged. Noel said that approximately l5 to 2o minutes later, while Epstein\nwas still using the telephone, the Unit Manager called the SHU staff via telephone, told Noel that Epstein’s\ntime was up, and asked that Noel retrieve the telephone from Epstein. Noel estimated that Epstein’s call\nlasted for 2o minutes and said the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler were also\npresent in the SHU during Epstein’s phone call. Noel reported that she took the phone back from Epstein,\nleft Epstein alone in the shouer, and went to use the bathroom on lo South. Noel said that upon her\nreturn, Epstein was already placed back in his cell.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during\nthe time of Epstein’s telephone call but did not overhear Epstein’s conversation.

The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nThe OIG's investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2ol9, was inaccurate\nbecause SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a\npredetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time. Houever, Epstein, who was in the\nSHU atorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.\nThe OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at\nlo p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not\ncorrected until l2 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master institutional\ncount and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at\nthat time.\nSenior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he\ntold the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be. In addition, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of\ninmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time.\nWhen interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from\nAugust 9, 2ol9, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel. Based on his\nreview, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and\nNoel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote doun the numbers they\nthought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate\n(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another\nhousing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon\nthe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 atempt to retrieve an unknoun item from his\nvisitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room. The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2ol9, reflected that\nfollouing this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:l5 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving\nand Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for observation when they are\nbelieved to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the inaccurate 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and\nwent by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred\nfrom the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the\n4 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the\nSHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.\nIn his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknouledged that neither he nor\nany other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had\nprepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day.

Noel claimed that, unlike the\n4 p.m. count slip, which the Evening Watch Officer in Charge pre-filled, she did not prepare the lo p.m.\ncount slip in advance of the count. Noel said she did not knou that the lo p.m. SHU count slip, which listed\n73 inmates, was inaccurate, and she could not explain why the l2 a.m. count also inaccurately listed that\n73 inmates were physically present in the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. count slips accurately listed\n72 inmates in the SHU.\nSenior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 6 told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he worked in the Control Center from\napproximately 4 p.m. until l2 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from l2 a.m. until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo.

Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 6 said that because there\nwere, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the lo p.m. count, he should have writen “73 - l\" on\nthe SHU count slip rather than “73 + l”.\n39 According to BOP records and witness interviews, “9S” refers to the SHU, which was located in 9th Floor South section\nof MCC New York.\n\n64\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2343l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023432.jpg": "Figure 5.l\nlo p.m. Count Slips from the SHU and Receiving and Delivery on August 9\n.

When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed\nthat Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The\nLieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.\nThe MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.\nWhen the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members\nwere picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher.

The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and\nuntil approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times. The Electronics Technician said\nhe delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same\non another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food\nto the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him. You weren't making rounds. You killed him.”\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU\nOfficers’ Station and never checked on the inmates. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood\nthe inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not\nconducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his oun\nlife and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.\nSenior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff\nmembers were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 6 said he assisted with\ntransporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then folloued the\nambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.\nThe OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs\natempting to resuscitate Epstein. The photographs shou, among other things, Epstein on his back with an\nintravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him\nwearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts. None of the photographs taken at MCC New York shou Epstein in\na hospital goun, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital which shou Epstein in a hospital goun.\nAdditionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at\nthe time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of\nsight to Epstein’s cell.44 One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from\nEpstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side\nof L Tier, where Epstein was housed. Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, a litle before l2 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.\nInmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning\nof August lo prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August lo. Inmate 5 said the male\nCO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door. Inmate 5 could only see\nEpstein’s legs from the knee doun but could tell that Epstein was laying doun on his back because his feet\nwere pointed upward. The male CO bent doun to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.” The\nmale CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein. Inmate 5 said\nboth the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer. Inmate 5 said\nthat once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein. The CO then started giving Epstein chest\ncompressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the\nfemale CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the buton. The female officer said,\n“Yeah, a long time ago.” A Lieutenant then arrived at Epstein’s cell along with a male nurse who tried to\n“8 As noted previously, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from all of the\ninmates housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the night that Epstein died.\n\n73\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2344o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023460.jpg": "The FBI's Digital Forensics Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia, received MCC New York's DVR system on\nAugust l6, 2ol9, and began to conduct a forensic analysis of the system. According to FBI forensic reports,\nDVR 2 did not start successfully. The Digital Forensics Analysis Unit found that the system contained three\nfaulty hard drives. The FBI forensic reports state that the three drives were repaired by an FBI Advanced\nData Recovery <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, but the DVR was never able to be assembled successfully. The forensic reports\nfurther state that an FBI computer scientist and the Company l Technician reviewed the DVR 2 controller\nlogs and found that there had previously been “catastrophic disk failures” and no recordings would have\nbeen available after July 29, 2ol9.\nWhen the OIG asked the Electronics Technician about this finding by the FBI, he told the OIG he was\nunaware that cameras were not recording to DVR 2 between July 29 and August 8, 2ol9. Neither the\nWarden nor the SIS Lieutenant was aware the cameras assigned to DVR 2 had not been recording since\nJuly 29, 2ol9.

Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cellmate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023472.jpg": "minimum elapsed time of on ‘days off’ will be fifty-six (56) hours, except when the employee requests\nthe change.””?\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that on August 9 he reported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m.\nto 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift in the warehouse. At some point during the day\nshift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, a higher ranking official, called and asked the Material Handler\nif he could work overtime in the SHU and he agreed. The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt\npressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9\nthrough l2 a.m. on August lo. As discussed previously, the Material Handler admited to the OIG that on\nthe evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not conduct the\nmandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired.\nThe OIG investigation and review concluded that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant exercised poor\njudgment when he requested that the Material Handler work a third consecutive shift. As the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, he had access to the staff roster and schedule and therefore he should have knoun\nthat the Material Handler had already worked l6 straight hours. Additionally, the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant's action was inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and did not reflect sound\ncorrectional judgment, as it would have been extremely difficult for the Material Handler to have effectively\nperformed his duties during his third shift.\n4. Clearing the lo p.m. Institutional Count Knouing that It Was Inaccurate\nThe OIG's investigation and review determined that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff cleared the\nlo p.m. institutional count knouing that the inmate counts from two housing units were inaccurate.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that COs conducting an institutional count relay the\ncount verbally to the Control Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates.®° If a count reported\nverbally does not match the master count, the Control Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and\nthe staff members must recount the inmates. MCC New York SHU Post Orders further provide that “[c]ount\nslips which appear to be altered will not be accepted.”\nAs discussed previously, the OIG determined that an internal transfer of an inmate (Inmate 4) from the SHU\nto Receiving and Discharge on August 9 was not documented appropriately at the time of the transfer. The\nfailure to document the transfer, along with the SHU staff not conducting the required inmate counts,\nresulted in the MCC New York Control Center receiving a count slip from the SHU with an incorrect number\nof inmates identified as being present within the SHU at the lo p.m. institutional count.\nDuring his OIG interview, Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admited that\nhe amended the lo p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an atempt to\nreflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU follouing the internal inmate transfer that resulted in a\nSHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day.

Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed\nabove, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the\nperformance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®’ Additionally, BOP\npolicy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are\nbeing folloued.®\nThe OIG's investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°? The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct\nany rounds in the SHU. He acknouledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did\nnot sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at lo p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the l2 a.m. count on August lo, which was due to SHU\nstaff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the\ninmates in the SHU. According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have\nconducted another count and submited a new count slip, but she did not knou if they actually did so.\nDuring her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed\nthat the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during\nwhich time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station\nin the common area of the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was not\nrequired to visit each tier or go to each individual cell during a lieutenant round, but rather the purpose of\nthe Lieutenant round was for her to speak with the officers on duty.

The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Acting Evening\nWatch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not supervise any\ninstitutional counts, which was due to the start and end time of her overtime shift.

According to a memorandum from Senior Officer <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>’ \"SHU\nstaff were informed at approximately l:5o p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmat would likely not\nreturn from court.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.
