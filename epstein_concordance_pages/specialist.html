Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 348\nor other divisions having responsibility for specific criminal enforcement, such as the Civil Rights\nDivision.

The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> assumes responsibility for victim notification.””” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span>....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which involve this matier, please contact the offics listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> with each victim, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.>!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?° The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also recetved a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 252 of 348\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”>°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --.. .\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.*4° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case.

You\n\nknou, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal\n\nprocess],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a\n\nfederal indictment and a federal trial.

February — March 2oo8: Villafatia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n3. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out ina leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised.\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 276 of 348\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span> and other key officials.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> assumes responsibility for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004520.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 223 of 349\n\nC.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 227 of 349\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> with each victim, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the\nconclusion, or. . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4524\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 239 of 349\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 249 of 349\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, ““The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 253 of 349\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”**?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --...\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.*4° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\na? Villafaia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR-oooo455o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 254 of 349\nprosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the\nplea was entered on June 3o, 2oo8.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims,\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nFrom my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it\n\nwas an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment. You\n\nknou, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal\n\nprocess],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a\n\nfederal indictment and a federal trial.

February — March 2oo8: Villafaia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n3. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-oooo455l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 265 of 349\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4562\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 277 of 349\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span> and other key officials.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case.

The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l5 of 349\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

In the most literal sense of the word, Epstein and Maxwell terrified\nme. They told me that if I told anyone, nobody would believe me and if they did, they would kill me\nand the people closest to me. I believed them. I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind. I loved life\nand people genuinely enjoyed being around me. After meeting Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\nit felt like someone shut off the lights to my soul.\n\nMy secrets became too much for me to handle, and I began doing whatever I could to try to\nget away from Maxwell and Epstein. I changed jobs, apartments, cities and even states to try to get\naway. Everywhere I went, they found me. In l997, I moved to Philadelphia with the hopes of finally\nstarting law school. They found me again and it was more than I could take. I was hospitalized with a\nnervous breakdoun. It would be the first of over two dozen hospitalizations in the decades follouing\nmy involvement with Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIn addition to my escalating mental health problems, I began to experience physical symptoms\nthat doctors could never quite put their finger on. I recetved dozens of diagnoses but nothing ever\nquite fit. I could no longer even pretend to be able to hold doun a job or take care of myself in any\nmeaningful way, and I had to move home once again. Emotionally I cracked, and nobody thought I\nwould ever get beter. But I did not give up.\n\nI was determined to do whatever I had to, to prove everyone wrong. I wasn't crazy, I was hurt.\nFor over a decade and a half I went to all kinds of medical specialists and was in and out of medical\nand psychiatric hospitals having tests and procedures, even submiting to clinical trials and an\nexperimental implantable medical device. Nothing helped.\n\nIn 2oo7, I moved back to Philadelphia to try once again to sort out my life. l began working\nas a paralegal again and started preparing to take the LSAT’s.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> assumes responsibility for victim notification.?”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021396.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 399 3536o38, Page224 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or <span class=\"highlight\">specialist</span>....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 356. 3536o38, Page228 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\n\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> with each victim, the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 - SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation.

Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.3!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\ncae Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021421.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 347 3536o38, Page249 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.’329\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”°?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update.

The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.°?* The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8.\nPat Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021422.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 348 3536o38, Page25o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open... it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n32o CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021426.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 38D 3536o38, Page254 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 252 of 348\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “‘never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”3°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point Ijust felt... like it was nonexistent.

The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted.

Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span>. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\nao The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n4d The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\nae Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021490.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page6o of 2l7\nSA-3l4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l4 of 348\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York\nAccording to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2ol9, at\napproximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC\nNew York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts.\nThe Supervisory Correctional Systems <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems <span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023420.jpg": "D. Failure to Assign Epstein a New Cellmate on August 9\nl. Day Watch Staff Actions on August 9\nThe SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that he worked at MCC New York on August 8, 2ol9, from approximately\n6 a.m. until approximately 2 p.m., and that he was off on August 9, 2ol9. The SHU Lieutenant, whose shift\nended over an hour before the USMS sent the second email regarding Inmate 3's impending transfer, told\nthe OIG he was not aware that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred out of MCC New York, and\ntherefore he did not notify the Captain that Epstein would require a new cellmate. According to the SHU\nLieutenant, as soon as the SHU staff learned that Inmate 3 would be transferred, they should have notified a\nLieutenant on duty. The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the\nOIG that on August 9, 2ol9, they had oversight of the SHU from approximately 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. due to\ntheir position descriptions and because of the SHU Lieutenant’s absence.\nAccording to the MCC New York Staff Roster, on August 9, 2ol9, SHU Officer #l was listed as Senior Officer\n<span class=\"highlight\">Specialist</span> 5.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a\ncellmate. He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or\npsychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant\nhad instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge, between July 3o and August 9, 2ol9, he told all other MCC New York staff members\nwho worked in the SHU of Epstein’s cell mate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in\nthe SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knouledge, training,\nand experience.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, the SHU staff\nreceived an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as “WAB,” which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was\nbeing removed from MCC New York. He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted\nEpstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time\nEpstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were\naccompanied by CO l, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge and CO l both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his\nbelongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that\nhe would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a\ncellmate. In his interview with the OIG, CO l confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications\nmade either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the\nOIG that when he and CO l left the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants’\nOffice and should have seen that Inmate 3 was departing the institution when they passed the office.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York,\nthere had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal,\nonly to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances.

These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence.
