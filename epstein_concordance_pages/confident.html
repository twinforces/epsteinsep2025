Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

B) (“Absolutely anyone who\ndares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... support Ghislaine personally, gets it\nshot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational\nslaughtering.”).

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded.

The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . .

Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\n<span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagellof2l\nprotective order. /d. And if confidential materials turn out to be relevant to a court’s ruling,\nSecond Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that they will be made public\nnotwithstanding any protective order.

If Maxwell\nsubjectively harbored this belief, it was nonetheless unreasonable.

Maxwell also makes a half-hearted argument\nthat obtaining those documents was a seizure of her personal property. Copies of documents\nheld by a law firm that represented Maxwell’s adversary in a civil case were not Maxwell’s\npersonal property. Thus, the Government engaged in neither a search nor a seizure, and so it did\nnot violate Maxwell’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe Government also contends that even if it improperly obtained documents pursuant to\nthe grand jury subpoena, the Court should not suppress those documents because the\nGovernment acted in good faith and would have obtained the documents anyway.

The parties' sole\nl9 rationale for sealing the submission is to at a general level\n2o avoid media coverage that may prejudice the jury selection\nal process. The jurors are sworn to give true and complete\n22 answers to the questionnaire and voir dire.\n23 I will be individually, one-on-one, questioning the\n24 jurors, and with the parties present, I feel <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that I\n25 can discern any clear dishonesty.

Given Juror No. 5o’s personal experience and belief about memory and its\nreliability, there was no way he could fairly evaluate Ms. Maxwell’s challenge to the\ncredibility of her accusers’ memories or the expert testimony of Dr. Loftus.'*\n\nSeveral decisions support this conclusion. In Sampson v. United States, for\nexample, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to order a new penalty-\nphase hearing in a death penalty case after a juror falsely denied, among other things,\nhaving been a victim of a crime. 724 F.3d at l54, l62. In fact, houever, the juror\nrepeatedly had been menaced by her husband with a shotgun. /d. at l68. But because the\njuror had not told the truth during voir dire, she was seated on a jury in a case involving a\nbank robbery in which the defendant threatened bank tellers at gunpoint. /d. “These\nparallels,” the Court said, “raise a serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in\n[the juror’s] shoes would be able to disregard her oun experiences in evaluating the\nevidence.” Jd.\n\nTo be sure, the juror in Sampson did not limit her false answers to a single\nquestion. She also answered falsely to several other questions during voir dire, some\nmaterial and some not. /d. at l62-63, l66. A combination of factors led the First Circuit\nto affirm the order for a new penalty-phase hearing. /d. at l68. Here, Juror No. 5o’s false\n\nJuror No. 5o’s confidence in his memory is not necessarily a predictor of the\nmemory’s reliability. As Dr. Loftus testified, “when you have post-event suggestion or\nintervention, people get very <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> about their wrong answers, and you can see that\neven wrong answers or false information, false memories can be expressed with a high\ndegree of confidence.” TR at 243o.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009052.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 5l of 66\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties\n\npresent, I feel <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009199.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 - Filed o2/24/22 Page 9 of 32\nte OK ok\n\nThis is a case where alleged child victims of sexual abuse delayed disclosure of their\nclaimed abuse for many years. The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

(This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions. In the\nunlikely event this challenge was denied, Juror No. 5o would have been questioned, in camera,\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l99", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009273.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEum Bute ne 669 Fileddz/24/22agePage 3l of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

RELEVANT FACTS'\n\nA. Defendant’s Educational Background and Work History\n\nParse obtained his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of\nMichigan in l984 and his Master’s degree in business administration from the same school in l988.\nPSR 4] 89-9o. Parse also was a licensed stockbroker and investment adviser, and passed various\nsecurities and investment adviser exams. From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an investment adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an investment representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a financial consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\n\nB. The Offense Conduct\n\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span>\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\n\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\n\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\n\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\ndiscovery, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9529", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4o of 66\nthat occurred at different times and places, bring it together, and construct\n\nwhat feels like a recollection.\n\nTR at 2427. Given Juror No. 5o’s personal experience and belief about memory and its\nreliability, there was no way he could fairly evaluate Ms. Maxwell’s challenge to the\ncredibility of her accusers’ memories or the expert testimony of Dr. Loftus.'*\n\nSeveral decisions support this conclusion. In Sampson v. United States, for\nexample, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to order a new penalty-\nphase hearing in a death penalty case after a juror falsely denied, among other things,\nhaving been a victim of a crime. 724 F.3d at l54, l62. In fact, houever, the juror\nrepeatedly had been menaced by her husband with a shotgun. /d. at l68. But because the\njuror had not told the truth during voir dire, she was seated on a jury in a case involving a\nbank robbery in which the defendant threatened bank tellers at gunpoint. /d. “These\nparallels,” the Court said, “raise a serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in\n[the juror’s] shoes would be able to disregard her oun experiences in evaluating the\nevidence.” Jd.\n\nTo be sure, the juror in Sampson did not limit her false answers to a single\nquestion. She also answered falsely to several other questions during voir dire, some\nmaterial and some not. /d. at l62-63, l66. A combination of factors led the First Circuit\nto affirm the order for a new penalty-phase hearing. /d. at l68. Here, Juror No. 5o’s false\n\nJuror No. 5o’s confidence in his memory is not necessarily a predictor of the\nmemory’s reliability. As Dr. Loftus testified, “when you have post-event suggestion or\nintervention, people get very <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> about their wrong answers, and you can see that\neven wrong answers or false information, false memories can be expressed with a high\ndegree of confidence.” TR at 243o.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9732", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 5l of 66\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties\n\npresent, I feel <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9743", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page9of32\nte OK ok\n\nThis is a case where alleged child victims of sexual abuse delayed disclosure of their\nclaimed abuse for many years. The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

Ifa juror’s going to lie and be dishonest,\n\nwe will smoke that out.\n\nTr. lo/2l/2l Hrg. at 26:l2.\n\nAlthough given multiple opportunities to identify himself as a victim of child sexual\nabuse, Juror No. 5o failed to truthfully respond to very clear and pointed questions such as “were\nyou the victim of a crime” and specifically, whether\n\nHave you or a friend or family member [have] ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions. In the\nunlikely event this challenge was denied, Juror No. 5o would have been questioned, in camera,\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9878", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009952.jpg": "Caetesb Ak Ores ABN nm Wa ‘Fae ORS DP Paes Bat cf 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an investment adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an investment representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a financial consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\nB. The Offense Conduct\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span>\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\ndiscovery, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3 of 4o\nHis tone, demeanor, and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror.

Ms. Maxwell reported that\nin January of 2o2l, a correction officer grabbed her breast with intense pressure during a\nroutine pat search, causing her significant discomfort and pain. She reported that she often\nrefuses to go to recreation to avoid being searched, which has negatively impacted her physical\nhealth because she is unable to get fresh air or exercise. She was reportedly denied an extra\nblanket in the winter and on more than one occasion an officer took one of her blankets from\nher after her request for an extra blanket was granted. She further reported that she was not\nprovided a proper food regimen for the first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she\nwas provided with small, inadequate portions or roten food. She has reportedly lost at least\nl5 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair loss.

As reported by Bloomberg,\nMr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all\nin violation of subsections (l), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule:\n\nThat’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who\n\nrepresents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused\n\nby Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her\n\ncredibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.\n\n‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying\n\nto blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so\n\ncontrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just\n\ngoing to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were\nrepresenting her.’\n\nBoies said he was <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if\n\nthere’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not\n\nto grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused\n\nme.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies\n\nsaid that Farmer was a l6-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met\n\nMaxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group\n\nof high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said.\n\n‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are\n\nfraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.”®\n\n® htps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghislaine-maxwell-may-play-the-victim-card-in-trial-\ndefense-l.l46563l\n\nApp.o35\nDOJ-OGR-oool9494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019955.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page96 of 2oo 33\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl information.

In our collective experience as defense counsel, we are\nnot aware of a previous example where a security company has posted a bond for a\ndefendant.

S).\n\nIn sum, these bonds reflect the depth of support that Ms. Maxwell has from her\nfamily and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live\nwithout constant media harassment to support her. (See Ex. B) (“Absolutely anyone who\ndares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... support Ghislaine personally, gets it\nshot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational\nslaughtering.””).

The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had.\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o946", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020981.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel55 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror.

There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations.

This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\n\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\n\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge.

I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence .. . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday ... to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... .

Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\n<span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\nOT\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023399.jpg": "Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could\nbe paired up with Inmate l again. Senior Officer Specialist l told Epstein that his request was something he\nwould need to raise with the Operations Lieutenant. Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that Epstein\nreplied, “Yeah, but | don’t understand, you knou, we were bunkies, everything was cool.” The Chief\nPsychologist also told the OIG that Epstein mentioned to her that he wanted Inmate l to continue to be\nhis cellmate.\nV. The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych Observation and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\ncompleted a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on\nmultiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and atentive about Epstein’s special needs.\nAccording to Associate Warden l, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.\nAssociate Warden l said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant\nshould have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement. Associate Warden l further told the OIG\nthat the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for ensuring that everything within the SHU was in compliance.\nAssociate Warden l told the OIG that the SHU staff knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and\nsaid she personally heard it being discussed on more than one occasion when she would visit the SHU while\nperforming her rounds.\nThe Captain, who supervised all of the Lieutenants and COs working in MCC New York, said that after the\ncellmate requirement was issued for Epstein, he spoke with the SHU Lieutenant and directed him to ensure\nthat Epstein had a cellmate. Similar to the Warden, the SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that while there is no\nBOP policy addressing the necessity of assigning cell mates to individuals coming off of suicide watch, it was\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23399", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023422.jpg": "The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant both told the OIG that they\ndid not knou Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the facility, despite the fact that both were recipients of\nthe second email the USMS sent on August 8 that included the information about Inmate 3's impending\ntransfer out of MCC New York on August 9. Rather, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day\nWatch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York\nfor a court appearance.\nThe Day Watch Activities Lieutenant did not recall Inmate 3 departing the institution with all of his\nbelongings or having any conversations with the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge or anyone else regarding\nInmate 3’s departure from MCC New York. According to the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, he did not\nknou that Epstein was without a cellmate. Other senior officials, including the Warden, Associate Warden l,\nand the Captain, were also unaware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nThese officials concurred that while all SHU staff and supervisors were responsible for notifying a supervisor\nin the chain-of-command of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge\nbore primary responsibility for the notification because he was the SHU Officer in Charge and one of two\npeople who saw Inmate 3 leave the facility with all of his belongings. The Captain told the OIG that since\nEpstein was in the atorney conference room all day, no one may have even thought about it, and may have\nonly become aware when they put Epstein back in his cell after his atorney visit that evening. The Captain\nsaid as soon as the SHU staff became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate, they should have notified\nthe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Captain said that if he had been informed, he would have\ntaken immediate action to ensure that Epstein was either assigned a new cellmate or monitored until that\nassignment occurred. The Captain, houever, was one of the recipients of the USMS August 8 email that\nnotified members of MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3's transfer to another facility. The Warden\nand Associate Warden l did not receive this email.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was off duty on August 9, 2ol9. The Warden said that in the event Epstein\nwas without a cellmate, the plan was to review the situation and decide who should replace Inmate 3, but\nthat no inmate in the SHU was preselected to replace Inmate 3 if this event occurred.\n2. Evening Watch Staff Actions on August 9\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9\nfrom approximately 2 p.m. until lo p.m. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, a\nMaterial Handler, CO 2, and CO Tova Noel. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that when he\nbegan his shift, Epstein was visiting with his atorneys in the atorney conference room. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a conversation with the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate. When advised that the Day Watch SHU Officer in\nCharge was <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated, “I don’t\nnecessarily want to call anyone a liar[] per se, but | don’t remember him speaking to me about this. So,\nmaybe he spoke to [Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe | was standing there, and he thought | heard\nhim.” The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC New York with all of his\nbelongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him because Epstein was required\nto have a cellmate.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23422", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00031008.jpg": "oe\nMa www.mnyspace.com/ Page | of 2\nMySpace.com | Home The Web (@) MySpace () | _ Search j Help | SignOut\nSa punt isHERS CLEARING HOUSE Yo.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerms is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\n<span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023399.tif": "Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could\nbe paired up with Inmate l again. Senior Officer Specialist l told Epstein that his request was something he\nwould need to raise with the Operations Lieutenant. Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that Epstein\nreplied, “Yeah, but | don’t understand, you knou, we were bunkies, everything was cool.” The Chief\nPsychologist also told the OIG that Epstein mentioned to her that he wanted Inmate l to continue to be\nhis cellmate.\nV. The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cell mate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych Observation and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\ncompleted a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on\nmultiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and atentive about Epstein’s special needs.\nAccording to Associate Warden l, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.\nAssociate Warden l said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant\nshould have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement. Associate Warden l further told the OIG\nthat the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for ensuring that everything within the SHU was in compliance.\nAssociate Warden l told the OIG that the SHU staff knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and\nsaid she personally heard it being discussed on more than one occasion when she would visit the SHU while\nperforming her rounds.\nThe Captain, who supervised all of the Lieutenants and COs working in MCC New York, said that after the\ncellmate requirement was issued for Epstein, he spoke with the SHU Lieutenant and directed him to ensure\nthat Epstein had a cellmate. Similar to the Warden, the SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that while there is no\nBOP policy addressing the necessity of assigning cellmates to individuals coming off of suicide watch, it was\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23399", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023422.tif": "The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant both told the OIG that they\ndid not knou Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the facility, despite the fact that both were recipients of\nthe second email the USMS sent on August 8 that included the information about Inmate 3's impending\ntransfer out of MCC New York on August 9. Rather, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day\nWatch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York\nfor a court appearance.\nThe Day Watch Activities Lieutenant did not recall Inmate 3 departing the institution with all of his\nbelongings or having any conversations with the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge or anyone else regarding\nInmate 3’s departure from MCC New York. According to the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, he did not\nknou that Epstein was without a cellmate. Other senior officials, including the Warden, Associate Warden l,\nand the Captain, were also unaware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nThese officials concurred that while all SHU staff and supervisors were responsible for notifying a supervisor\nin the chain-of-command of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge\nbore primary responsibility for the notification because he was the SHU Officer in Charge and one of two\npeople who saw Inmate 3 leave the facility with all of his belongings. The Captain told the OIG that since\nEpstein was in the atorney conference room all day, no one may have even thought about it, and may have\nonly become aware when they put Epstein back in his cell after his atorney visit that evening. The Captain\nsaid as soon as the SHU staff became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate, they should have notified\nthe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Captain said that if he had been informed, he would have\ntaken immediate action to ensure that Epstein was either assigned a new cellmate or monitored until that\nassignment occurred. The Captain, houever, was one of the recipients of the USMS August 8 email that\nnotified members of MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3's transfer to another facility. The Warden\nand Associate Warden l did not receive this email.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was off duty on August 9, 2ol9. The Warden said that in the event Epstein\nwas without a cellmate, the plan was to review the situation and decide who should replace Inmate 3, but\nthat no inmate in the SHU was preselected to replace Inmate 3 if this event occurred.\n2. Evening Watch Staff Actions on August 9\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9\nfrom approximately 2 p.m. until lo p.m. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, a\nMaterial Handler, CO 2, and CO Tova Noel. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that when he\nbegan his shift, Epstein was visiting with his atorneys in the atorney conference room. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a conversation with the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate. When advised that the Day Watch SHU Officer in\nCharge was <span class=\"highlight\">confident</span> about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated, “I don’t\nnecessarily want to call anyone a liar[] per se, but | don’t remember him speaking to me about this. So,\nmaybe he spoke to [Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe | was standing there, and he thought | heard\nhim.” The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC New York with all of his\nbelongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him because Epstein was required\nto have a cellmate.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23422"};
