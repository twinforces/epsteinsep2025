Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa.

See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety.

The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v.

Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec.

And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo869", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000883.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Page/ of 25\n\ncapacity of the internet platform system, only one atorney per party may participate\nby video.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption.

Ms. Maxwell Has Rebuted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight\n\nRisk. and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No\n\nCombination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her\n\nPresence In Court\n\nThe government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions\nwill reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo97l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001016.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page75 of 2oo La\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl and federal law disclosure obligations.\n\n2 Go ahead, Ms. Moe.\n\n3 MS.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997).

(Dkt. 66). Despite numerous atempts\nto fix these problems over the succeeding weeks, including producing a replacement hard drive\ncontaining these productions, the problems were not resolved and the replacement hard drive was\nbroken. In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense\nalerted the government to these problems, contained some of the same technical problems and\nincluded a significant number of unreadable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the\nsixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable discovery for over four months.’ Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the discovery.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine. On\nNovember l8, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in l4-day quarantine due\nto contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving team of guards assigned to Ms.\nMaxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their oun COVID outbreaks,\nheightens her exposure to the virus. As reported by the associate warden to the Criminal Justice\nAdvisory Board on December 2, MDC does not mandate testing among its staff. A temperature\ncheck and response to a few questions does litle to detect an asymptomic carrier. The constant\nstrip searching, touch wanding, and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for\nexposure to COVID-l9.\n\n'3 On November l8, 2o2o, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC,\nwhich it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive\ncontaining all of the discovery. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\ntechnical problems. We note, houever, that nou that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has\naccess to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot\nbecause of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer.\n\n37\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001152.jpg": "CaSede2ol er Co F3ZocAdNt n Die GmMenolooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect o Gb 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).

Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives.

The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll76", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001193.jpg": "Casesb:2o-cr/ooBBGHAUNt DOcuNei LA8 2 Filed6R223/2thgPageBlGdl5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nIl.

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v.

But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v.

The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001217.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGNnt DOctina rf ll26 2 Filee6Ba3o/PagP ageBblGk22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001278.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd33ouAuNit Tibsutrent l682 lFikO83222/2agFliagew o642\nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense\nspecifically enumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or\ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the\ncommunity or others. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“[A] defendant must\nintroduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).\nNonetheless, “‘the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing\nevidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’” English, 629 F.3d at\n3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>,” houever, “the presumption favoring\ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool278", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001279.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOC33ouAdNnt Tibsutent l682 lF ib 83222/2agPFlagecs o642\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001297.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye of 6656\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool297", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001298.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7 /oroo 2axtauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooool298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001332.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel5 of 25\nARGUMENT\nThe District Court Properly Denied Maxwell’s Motions for Bail and\nTemporary Release\n\n27.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool355", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001378.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 57, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page6 of 3o\noccurred here.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial.

These restrictions are additional “compelling reasons”\njustifying her release. See id.*\n\nIL. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42.\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shail order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive .. . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n* See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc. No. 78) (detailing absence of in-person\nvisitation, highly limited VTC and telephone call capacity, and issues pertaining to legal mail and legal documents).\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool593", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l4 of 26\n\nThe government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose. . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]Jny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption.

Although the presumption “remains a factor\nto be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, “[a]t all times . . .\nthe government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the\nevidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (citation and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States\nv.

And\nregardless of the presence of the presumption or the nature of the charges alleged, “[n]othing in\nthis section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j); see also United States v.

Ms. Maxwell Has Rebuted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight\n\nRisk, and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No\n\nCombination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her\n\nPresence In Court\n\nThe government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions\nwill reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-ooool595", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false. The protective order in the Epstein case included\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool667", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 2 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 2\nof course, has not had access to the discovery materials) to anticipate and respond to government\nhypotheticals regarding what the discovery might contain, and hou language might address such\nhypotheticals. But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 2 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nthat we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is\nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly\n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United\nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in\nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to\nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims l-3 referenced in the indictment.\n\nIt is nou almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, and the government is just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not\nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims l-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2,\n2o2o. On July l4, 2o2o, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that\nit had “begun preparing an initial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>” and would be “prepared to produce a first batch of\ndiscovery as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court.”' The Court entered the\nprotective order on July 3o, 2o2o. (Dkt. 36). The follouing day, July 3l, 2o2o, defense counsel\ncontacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims l-3. The\ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims\nthrough its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Rule l6 discovery, or as part of its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks Act material\ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government’s request, the defense provided a hard drive to\nload the Rule l6 discovery. Houever, the government did not make its first <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> until\nafter 2:oo p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o.\n\nThe government’s initial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials,\ntotaling nearly l3,ooo pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content.\nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual.\nHouever, nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> specifically identifies this individual as Victim l, 2, or 3.\nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three\nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> does not appear to\ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has\nindicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is\nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged\nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks\nuntil August 2l, 2o2o (the deadline for the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of initial non-electronic discovery) or\npotentially months until November 9, 2o2o (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before\nlearning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial depends on\nthe defense’s ability to adequately investigate the charges against her, and that investigation will\nbe significantly impaired until we knou for certain the names of Victims l-3.\n\n\"July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2:l4-l7; see also id. at l2:25-l3:3 (“Follouing the entry of [the] protective order . . . the\ngovernment is prepared to make a substantial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of discovery.”).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust lo, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nDistrict courts have the inherent authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses. See United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Such\ndisclosure is warranted when there is a specific shouing that the disclosure is material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See\nid. at 3o2; United States v. Rueb, No. oo CR. 9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 5 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

This is\nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly\n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United\nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in\nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to\nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims l-3 referenced in the indictment.\n\nIt is nou almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, and the government is just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not\nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims l-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2,\n2o2o. On July l4, 2o2o, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that\nit had “begun preparing an initial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>” and would be “prepared to produce a first batch of\ndiscovery as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court.”' The Court entered the\nprotective order on July 3o, 2o2o. (Dkt. 36). The follouing day, July 3l, 2o2o, defense counsel\ncontacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims l-3. The\ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims\nthrough its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Rule l6 discovery, or as part of its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks Act material\ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government’s request, the defense provided a hard drive to\nload the Rule l6 discovery. Houever, the government did not make its first <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> until\nafter 2:oo p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o.\n\nThe government’s initial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials,\ntotaling nearly l3,ooo pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content.\nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual.\nHouever, nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> specifically identifies this individual as Victim l, 2, or 3.\nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three\nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> does not appear to\ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has\nindicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is\nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged\nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks\nuntil August 2l, 2o2o (the deadline for the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of initial non-electronic discovery) or\npotentially months until November 9, 2o2o (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before\nlearning information that is vital to the defense.

See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y.

Both applications should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses\n\nFor the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the\nCourt for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2o2o (Dkt. 28)\n(denying the defendant’s request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and\natorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements “concerning this case”); Order\ndated July 3o, 2o2o (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant’s application for a protective order that would\nallou the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant’s most recent\napplication, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the\nform of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’’),\nfully ll months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\ndiscovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nhad no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding for witness lists and 35oo material.\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>,\narguing that “almost six weeks since” the arrest of the defendant, the Government is “just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order.” Def.

The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based\non the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the\ndefendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

Those\ncircumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v.

While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day\nof access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including\nthose with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2o2l—as of earlier this week, and given\nthe volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity\nto access to her discovery from 7:oo a.m. to 8:oo p.m. every day of the week. Although this\narrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and\nis subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on\nan ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so.

As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently difficult to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a compromise solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient.

These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts.

During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide additional information in\nresponse to the Court’s prior inquiry regarding the Government’s plan to obtain and review other\ninvestigative files, created and maintained by other offices, which are related to the above-\nreferenced case. In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review. Consistent with the Government’s\ncommitment to take a thorough and transparent approach to its disclosure obligations, this leter\noutlines the relevant investigative files of which the Government is currently aware and describes\nthe Government’s approach as to each.\n\nl. Background Regarding the Government’s Rule l6 Discovery Productions\n\nThe charges in this case arise out of an investigation conducted by the United States\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York Police Department (the “NYPD”’)\n(collectively, the “Prosecution Team’). That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, financial records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law enforcement reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 2 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nreturns. The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v. Gambino, 835 F. Supp. 74, 95\n(E.D.N.Y. l993)). Thus, discovery and disclosure obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the disclosure of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material. If the Government becomes aware of any Brady\nmaterial from any source, it will promptly disclose such material to the defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 5of8\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 7 of 8\nHonorable Alison J.

As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline assistant on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution. But to the extent searches of Atorney-l’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or\n35oo material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified\nmaterial consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government\ndoes not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice\natorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’s\noffice from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered\nby OPR as part of its investigation.\n\nSixth, beginning in or about 2ol9, atorneys with the United States Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Georgia (“USAO-SDGA”) were designated to participate in the\nrepresentation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of\nthe Crime Victim Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government\nintends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications\nwith witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or\n(b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government\nwill request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials\nthat warrant disclosure in this case. Otherwise, the Government does not intend to request or\nreview any materials from the USAO-SDGA.\n\n%* %* XK\n\nAs noted above, none of these other offices or agencies has played any role in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of this case. In particular, none of these offices and agencies has\nparticipated in witness interviews or taken any other investigative steps with the Prosecution Team.\nNor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy,\nmaking charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the\nGovernment maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case,\ngiven the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct\ninvestigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the\nextensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in opposition to the government’s\nOctober 6, 2o2o leter requesting the Court’s permission to delay the disclosure of photographs\nand documents relating to certain alleged victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the\n“Materials”), pursuant to Rule l6(d)(l) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Dkt. 6o).\nThe government’s request should be denied for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it is clear from the government’s leter that the Materials pertain to individuals who\nclaim to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms.\nMaxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials\nidentifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be\ndisclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963)\nand its progeny.’\n\nSecond, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule l6\nbecause the Materials are “material to preparing the defense” and the government has not shoun\ngood cause to delay <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the Materials under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\n' We note that yesterday we sent the government a leter making specific Brady requests, including “[a|ny statements\n\nor writen communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr.\n\nEpstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse.”\nDOJ-OGR-ooool795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 4 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

If you knou.\n\nA: [don’t knou what you’re talking about.\n\nSimilarly, Count Six alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the follouing exchange:\n\nQ: Other than yourself... with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities?\n\nA: Lwasn’t aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone when I was\n\nwith him other than myself.\n\nQ: I want to make sure that I’m clear. Is it your testimony that in the l99os and\n\n2ooos, you were not aware that Ms. Epstein was having sexual activities with\nanyone other than yourself... ?\n\nA: That is my testimony, that is correct.\n\nThe government has spoken to numerous individuals who claim to have been assaulted by Epstein\nafter l997, but do not implicate Ms. Maxwell in the assault or claim that she knew about it in any\nway. That bolsters Ms. Maxwell’s defense that she was not aware of either Epstein’s scheme to\nrecruit and sexually abuse underage girls, or that Epstein was engaging in sexual activities with\nothers, and therefore did not perjure herself in response to those questions.\n\nAccordingly, the Materials and the prior statements of the witnesses to whom they pertain\nare exculpatory evidence inconsistent with the government’s theory of the charges in the\nIndictment and must be disclosed pursuant to the government’s Brady obligations.\n\n2. The Government Has Not Shoun Good Cause that Disclosure of the Materials Will\nInterfere with an Ongoing Investigation\n\nEven if the Court does not find this evidence to be exculpatory, the Materials are “material\nto preparing the defense” and therefore should be disclosed under Rule l6(a)(l)(E). The\ngovernment agrees that the Materials should be produced, but asserts that there is good cause to\ndelay the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the Materials until eight weeks before trial, pursuant to Rule l6(d). (Dkt.\n6o at 2-3). The government’s justification for the delay, houever, is entirely inadequate to\nestablish good cause.\n\nThe government asserts that disclosing the Materials will prematurely reveal to the defense\nthe identities of certain victims of Epstein who are not referenced in the Indictment, as well as\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool798", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001801.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page l of 4\n.)

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in further support of its request to delay\ndisclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding\nvictims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are\nnot exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government\nis not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully\nintends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it\nhas interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that\ninvestigation remains ongoing, houever, and because the Materials are unrelated to the charges\ncontained in the Indictment, <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> at this stage would be premature and would reveal the\nscope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that it be permited to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.\n\nFirst, Maxwell’s opposition misconstrues the Government’s description of the Materials\nand conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue\nhere include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused\nduring time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness\nstatements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the\nGovernment will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus\ndo not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the\ndefendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed belou,\nwhether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that\npostdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.\n\nSecond, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not\nexculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the concept of exculpatory\nmaterial beyond recognition in a way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under\nthe defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after l997 without the\ndefendant’s involvement, that somehou exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her\nwith participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between l994 and l997. (Def. Ltr. 3-4). The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nThird, the defense’s claim that the Materials are “material to preparing [her] defense” under\nRule l6, and thus subject to immediate disclosure, is premised on a reimagining of the charges\nagainst the defendant. (Def. Ltr. l, 4). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule\nl6 only insofar as “it could be used to counter the government’s case or bolster a defense.” United\nStates v. Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d Cir. l993). Thus, materials that are wholly irrelevant\nto the Government’s case or the charges in the Indictment do not fall under Rule l6. That is the\ncase here. Contrary to the defense’s claim, the Government has not charged Maxwell with being\nJeffrey Epstein’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def. Ltr. 3). Instead, the\ndefendant is charged with helping Epstein identify, groom, and sexually abuse multiple minor\nvictims between l994 and l997. The Indictment does not allege that the defendant engaged in\nsuch conduct after l997. As such, the Materials are simply not relevant to the charges in the\nIndictment, much less exculpatory to the defendant.\n\nMaxwell’s argument is equally flawed with respect to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).\nThe Indictment alleges that the Government’s evidence on Counts One through Four based on her\nconduct from l994 to l997 is also evidence of the falsity of the answers provided in the deposition.\nSpecifically, the portions of her deposition that the Government alleges in the Indictment are false\nare all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period l994 through l997. Indeed, paragraph eight of the\nIndictment notes that the defendant’s statements during her deposition contradicted “some of the\nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period from l994 through l997. (Indictment, Docket No. l7, at\nlo). Consistent with that position, Counts Five and Six both incorporate by reference paragraphs\none through eight of the Indictment. (See id. at l5-l6). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant\ndid or did not participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at different times or on different\noccasions not charged in the Indictment would not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate\nthe defendant on those counts.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more importantly, the Government is not suggesting that these\nMaterials should be kept from the defense indefinitely. Rather, the Government requests\nauthorization to provide these Materials eight weeks prior to trial, along with its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\nstatements of other non-testifying witnesses. Even assuming arguendo that the Materials\nconstitute Brady or Rule l6 evidence—which they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—\nthe defendant cites no case law for the proposition that she is entitled to their <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> nou,\nrather than eight weeks in advance of trial. The Second Circuit has held that “as a general rule,\nBrady and its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment\nmaterial upon request by a defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l46 (2d Cir. 2ool).\nInstead, “the Government ‘suppresses’ evidence within the meaning of Brady only if it fails to\ndisclose Brady and Giglio material in time for its effective use at trial or at a plea proceeding.” Jd.\nWhat constitutes sufficient time for “effective use at trial” depends on the “materiality of that\nevidence” and “the particular circumstances of the case.” Id.\n\nHere, the defendant has made no shouing as to why eight weeks in advance of trial would\nnot be enough time to make “effective use” of the Materials at trial or hou she would otherwise\nbe prejudiced by the Government’s proposed disclosure timeline. Coppa, 267 F.3d at l46. Indeed,\ngiven that the Materials constitute approximately 4o pages of records and approximately 4o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nphotographs of victims who were abused during periods of time that post-date the Indictment and\nwho the Government does not anticipate calling to testify at trial—and as such, do not constitute\nBrady material, Rule l6 evidence, or impeachment material for any trial witnesses—the defendant\nis not entitled to their immediate <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. This is particularly so when weighed against the\nrisks of early <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to the Government’s ongoing investigation.\n\nBy contrast, the Government has met its burden under Rule l6(d)(l) by explaining why\nthe requested delay is necessary and hou the Government would be prejudiced by the immediate\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the Materials. In particular, the proposed delay will allou the Government to\ncontinue its investigation into conduct outside the period charged in the Indictment without\nrevealing to the defendant the identities of the witnesses in that investigation. The premature\nrevelation of this information would give the defendant the opportunity to interfere with the\nGovernment’s investigation before it is complete. Such information could allou her to contact\nand intimidate witnesses, destroy evidence relevant to the investigation, or alert other targets of\nthe investigation. Moreover, the requirement that any evidence of any victim’s abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein at any point in time must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case, even when\nit has no bearing on the charges in the Indictment, risks deterring additional victims from coming\nforward to assist in the Government’s investigation. Allouing the delayed <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of these\nmaterials would permit the Government to complete its investigation without interference while\nstill giving the defense everything it is asking for well in advance of trial.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court approve the\nGovernment’s request to delay disclosure of these Materials.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page l of 7\n2) Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nJeffrey Pagliuca\nHADDON\nMook oe N l5o East loth Avenue\nSOUS ee be Denver, Colorado 8o2o3\nPH 3o3.83l.7364 Fx 3o3.832.2628\nwww.hmilaw.com\njpaglisca@hmfilaw.com\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nAt the initial conference in this case, the Government promised Ms. Maxwell and the\nCourt that it would review and produce “prior investigative files from another investigation in\nthe Southern District of Florida,”! which it characterized as part of “the core of the case” against\nMs. Maxwell,” after a “careful and exhaustive and through review of all of the materials,” with\nthe “bulk” of the discovery produced by “the end of this summer [2o2o].”? Summer is gone,\nWinter is coming, and the Government has failed to make good on its promises.\nAlthough it casts the October 7, 2o2o leter to the Court as a “response to the Court’s\nprior inquiry regarding” its plan to produce discovery, the Government is, in fact, abandoning the\ndeadlines to which it already agreed and reneging on (or redefining) its assurances to the Court\nthat it would engage in “thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of questions and issues with\nrespect to actively retrieving any appropriate files.” In fact, the promised “substantial”\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of discovery is “substantial” in size, not substance. Approximately one fourth of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> relates to materials gathered in civil litigation to which Ms. Maxwell was a party. The\nremainder of the discovery contains documents from the 2ooos that relate largely to Jeffrey\nEpstein and therefore have nothing to do with the time period of the conspiracy charged in the\n!

Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 4\ninvestigation. The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the\nentire theory of prosecution.\n\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo7.\nThis is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.\n\nAccording to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in\n2ol6 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to\nconvince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not\nultimately succeed. Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is\nsignificant exculpatory information that is needed to investigate, prepare motions, and defend at\ntrial.®\n\nWe assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or\nbenefited from Epstein’s NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the\nclaimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount. The\nGovernment presumably has this information which is unquestionably favorable evidence which\n“includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful\nto impeach the credibility of a government witness....” United States v.

The Government claims no responsibility for investigations into these allegations\nby either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of the United States Atorney unless\npart of the Southern District of New York. This stands in stark contrast to the on-the-record\nassurances that it gave the Court on July l4, 2o2o:\n\n“’,.the materials with respect to the core of the case also include prior investigative files\n\nfrom another investigation in the Southern District of Florida....” Tr. p. l2:lo-l3\n\n“The physical files [from the Florida investigation] were shipped to New York and are at\n\nthe New York F.B.I. office.

On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had completed its first three discovery productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\ndiscovery materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of discovery materials. That <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001812.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page l of 4\nos U.S. Department of Justice\nN44 United States Atorney\n\ni Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nOctober 23, 2o2o in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Leter”). For all of its innuendo and\naccusations, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 discovery to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of electronic discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\nelectronic discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Rule l6\ndiscovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nits outside vendor to image, stamp, and dounload that electronic discovery, which the Government\nfinished preparing for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> last week, from an electronic database. The volume of that\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is large and takes significant time for the vendor to prepare. It is therefore possible that\nthe vendor may need a limited amount of additional time to complete that process. That said, the\nGovernment has repeatedly informed the vendor of the November 9, 2o2o deadline, and the vendor\nis making every effort to meet it. The Government expects an update from the vendor early next\nweek and will promptly alert the Court and the defense if it appears the vendor will need additional\ntime beyond November 9 to finalize this <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. But contrary to the defense’s suggestion, the\nGovernment has made numerous productions consistent with the discovery schedule in this case\nand is working diligently to continue to meet the discovery deadlines in this case.\n\nWith respect to the defense’s other claims and accusations, the Government is prepared to\nrespond in detail at the appropriate stage. But in short, many of the defense’s accusations about\nthe Government’s allegedly deficient productions are not only factually or legally incorrect, but\nalso include complaints that the Court has already directed the defense to renew only if unable to\nreach agreement with the Government “[f]ollouing the close of discovery,” which has not yet\noccurred. (Order dated Aug. 25, 2o2o, Dkt. 49, at 2). Others turn on the defense’s baseless\natempts to redefine classic Giglio or Jencks Act material as Rule l6 discovery, or on a faulty\ndefinition of exculpatory material that has no basis in law. (See Gov. Ltr. dated Aug. l3, 2o2o,\nDtk. No. 4l, at 2-3 (noting law supporting delay of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of witness list until shortly before\ntrial); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63, at 2 (noting that Rule l6 does not require\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of witness statements or Giglio); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65, at l-2\n(noting well-established law in this Circuit precluding defense from offering evidence that a\ndefendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a different occasion than that charged by the\nGovernment)).”\n\nWith respect to the Government’s October 7 leter regarding other agency files, the\ndefense’s claims that the Government has “minimize[d]” what it promised and “redefine[d] who\nit believes is part of the Prosecution Team” are deeply misleading.’ (Def. Ltr. 4). To be clear, the\nGovernment has always viewed FBI files from both the prior Florida investigation and the more\nGovernment may identify additional discoverable materials after the deadline. Should that happen,\nthe Government will promptly produce such materials to the defense.\n\n? Tn addition to repeating previously made arguments, the defense nou contends that evidence\nabout the “genesis” of the non-prosecution agreement between the United States Atorney’s Office\nfor the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein, is exculpatory. (Def. Ltr. 4). The defense\nmakes this assertion despite the fact that neither this Office nor the defendant were party to that\nagreement, the agreement covered conduct spanning a different period of time than that charged\nin this case, and the agreement does not mention the defendant by name. To the extent the defense\nnevertheless believes it is entitled to those materials, the appropriate forum to raise those\narguments is on the pretrial motion schedule established by the Court.\n\n> Tt bears mention that at no point did the defense seek to confer with the Government regarding\nany concerns about the Government’s October 7 leter or the Government’s planned productions\nprior to filing the Defense Leter with the Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\nrecent New York investigation as part of the Prosecution Team’s files, and stated as much at the\ninitial pretrial conference and in its October 7, 2o2o leter. Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in\nconnection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files. (Dkt. 63 at 5, 6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthat the defendant has had difficulty opening on the MDC computer system.° Because those efforts\nare already underway and remain ongoing, there is no need for an order directing them.\n\nSecond, the Defense Leter complains about issues within the MDC that are not in the\nGovernment’s control, but that the Government has nevertheless spent significant time addressing\nat the defense’s behest. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that\nMDC staff has been instructed to allou defense counsel to pass papers to their client for her to\nreview during visits. Accordingly, there is no need for an order to address this issue. MDC legal\ncounsel also noted that the table in the atorney visiting room is equipped with a Plexiglas barrier\ndoun the middle to prevent the spread of COVID-l9. Atorneys and clients are required to sit on\nopposite sides of that barrier for their health and safety, but they can position any laptop they may\nbe reviewing in such a way that both the client and atorneys can view it while remaining on\nopposite sides of the table. Finally, the Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the\ndefendant has access to her discovery for approximately l3 hours per day and therefore receives\nmore time to review her discovery than any other inmate in the MDC.\n\nXK XK XK\n\nThe Government is working expeditiously to meet its obligations and discovery deadlines,\nwhich it takes very seriously. The Government’s primary objective, of course, is to finalize the\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of discovery as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that its productions are\ncomplete. At any point, should the defense have questions or concerns about the discovery, the\nGovernment has been and remains available to discuss any such issues directly with counsel.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nActing United States Atorney\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n> It is not clear to the Government what documents the defendant is unable to view at this point,\nbut to be clear, the technical issues have, at their worst, impacted the defendant’s ability to view\nonly a subset of the hundreds of thousands of pages produced to her. The defense has previously\nprovided the Government with lists of documents that the defendant could not open. In response,\nthe Government has sent the defendant replacement productions with reformated versions of each\nidentified document after consulting with MDC staff to ensure that the files would be viewable on\nthe MDC computer system. Yesterday, defense counsel informed the Government that the\ndefendant still cannot view certain files, but the defense has not identified all of the specific\nunreviewable documents. In any event, the Government will continue to work with the defense\nand the MDC to ensure that the defendant can review all discovery.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 68 Filed ll/o5/2o Page 2 of 2\n\nIn the event the Government believes that a disclosure under this Order would compromise\nwitness safety, victim rights, national security, a sensitive law-enforcement technique, or any other\nsubstantial government interest, it may apply to the Court for a modification of its obligations,\nwhich may include in camera review or withholding or subjecting to a protective order all or part of\nthe information otherwise subject to disclosure.\n\nFor purposes of this Order, the Government includes all current or former federal, state, and\nlocal prosecutors, law-enforcement officers, and other officers who have participated in the\nprosecution, or investigation that led to the prosecution, of the offense or offenses with which the\ndefendant is charged.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request an extension of the deadline for\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of a subset of the electronic discovery in the above-referenced case from November\n9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o. This extension is necessary solely to allou adequate time for an\noutside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from electronic devices seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense\nconditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no connection to the delay in discovery\nand no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the\nextension to produce electronic discovery to November 23, 2o2o.\n\nTo date, the Government has produced more than 35o,ooo pages of discovery to the\ndefense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> by the existing November 9, 2o2o deadline, as detailed belou. Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of electronic discovery. By way of background, that final\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v.

March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool82o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthese materials come from devices seized from Epstein’s residences, and none of the devices is\nbelieved to have belonged to the defendant.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request an extension of the deadline for\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of a subset of the electronic discovery in the above-referenced case from November\n9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o. This extension is necessary solely to allou adequate time for an\noutside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from electronic devices seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense\nconditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no connection to the delay in discovery\nand no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the\nextension to produce electronic discovery to November 23, 2o2o.\n\nTo date, the Government has produced more than 35o,ooo pages of discovery to the\ndefense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> by the existing November 9, 2o2o deadline, as detailed belou. Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of electronic discovery. By way of background, that final\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool828", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62 Filed ll/o8/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool829", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62 Filed ll/o8/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request that the Court grant the\nGovernment permission to delay disclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents\nregarding victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n' Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial. Houever, Rule\nl6(d)(l) also provides that:\n\nAt any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer\n\ndiscovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief. The court\n\nmay permit a party to shou good cause by a writen statement that\n\nthe court will inspect ex parte.\nA finding of good cause “‘must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm,\nnot on conclusory statements.’” United States v.

Count Two of the Indictment charges Maxwell with enticing a minor to travel to engage in\nillegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 and 2. Count Three of the Indictment charges\nMaxwell with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to participate in illegal sex\nacts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §37l. Count Four of the Indictment charges Maxwell with\ntransporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423 and 2. Counts\nFive and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 5o6, 53l-32 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (risk of interference with ongoing\ninvestigation sufficient good cause for entry of Rule l6 protective order). Immediate disclosure\nof these materials would have the effect of prematurely revealing to the defendant the identities of\ncertain Epstein victims who are not referenced in the Indictment but who have spoken with the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/o6/2o Page 3 of 3\nPage 3\nGovernment as part of its ongoing investigation, well in advance of any trial in this mater.\nPremature disclosure of these witnesses’ identities and sensitive information about those witnesses\nrisks jeopardizing the Government’s ongoing investigation in at least two respects.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up [by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . [including] flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovernment represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.” The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed.

(Dkt. 66). Despite numerous atempts\nto fix these problems over the succeeding weeks, including producing a replacement hard drive\ncontaining these productions, the problems were not resolved and the replacement hard drive was\nbroken. In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense\nalerted the government to these problems, contained some of the same technical problems and\nincluded a significant number of unreadable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the\nsixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable discovery for over four months.'? Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the discovery.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine. On\nNovember l8, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in l4-day quarantine due\nto contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving team of guards assigned to Ms.\nMaxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their oun COVID outbreaks,\nheightens her exposure to the virus. As reported by the associate warden to the Criminal Justice\nAdvisory Board on December 2, MDC does not mandate testing among its staff. A temperature\ncheck and response to a few questions does litle to detect an asymptomic carrier. The constant\nstrip searching, touch wanding, and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for\nexposure to COVID-l9.\n\n8 On November l8, 2o2o, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC,\nwhich it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive\ncontaining all of the discovery. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\ntechnical problems. We note, houever, that nou that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has\naccess to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot\nbecause of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer.\n\n37\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002120.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page 25 of 29\nAnnex D — time-limits in relation to US extradition requests under the Extradition Act\n2oo3\n\nPreliminary stages\nCertification of the No statutory time-limit!\nextradition request\nComment [l]: there is no consistent practice as to the length\nof time that it takes to certify an extradition request.

The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l94", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 34 of 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page 8 of l5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nII.

(Gov. Mem. at l3). The government ignores that, since the initial bail\nhearing, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submited a\ndetailed leter describing his commited relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years\nand the important role she has played, and continues to play, Po\nP| It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell’s closest friends and family, many of\nwhom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk,\nto support her bond with pledges of assets or leters of support. This information, which\nwas not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearmg, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell’s\nstrong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government atempts to dismiss the significance\nof Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial\nServices that she was in the process of geting a divorce and that her spouse did not step\nforward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing.

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “[e]xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that [it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“[A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”). Nonetheless, “‘the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2235", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 4 of 22\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’” English, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting\nMercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986)\n(“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”). Even when “a\ndefendant has met his burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>,” houever, “the presumption favoring detention does\nnot disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district\ncourt.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail\nhearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and\nthat has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is warranted. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(f). But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “[a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v. Havens, 487\nF. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing because the\nnew information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant until trial).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7-9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 7 of 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 8 of 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information—including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “[a] judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002337.jpg": "__ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l29 Filed o2/ol/2l Page l of 2\nU.S. Department of Justice\nees United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2337", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\n\nGiuffre, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill batle—even she\nwas constrained to acknouledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 46, 5l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (explaining that discovery was “hard-fought” and “extensive” and\nnoting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery,\ntotals in the “thousands of pages”).\n\nGiuffre sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about\nMaxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual maters. Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between\nthe parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective\nOrder included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party’s confidentiality\ndesignation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any\ninformation or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case setled before trial, that sole\nexception to the Protective Order was never triggered.)\n\nNotably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law enforcement” exception to the Protective\nOrder, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against\nMaxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that\n“CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the\npreparation and trial of this case and any related mater, including but not limited to,\ninvestigations by law enforcement.” Ex.

Similarly, an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under\nthe age of l8 years” is an offense in which such sexual abuse, physical abuse, or kidnapping is an\nelement of the offense.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit concluded as much in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th\nCir. 2oll). There, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a charge of possession of child\npornography. /d. at 8l7-l8. The court clearly looked to the elements of the statute, as the facts\nof the case did involve the sexual abuse of a child, including the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and possession of\nchild pornography. /d. at 8l3-l4. Yet the court held that, on the same set of facts, the offense of\npossession of child pornography did not involve sexual abuse and thus was subject to the general\nstatute of limitations, but the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of child pornography did involve sexual\nabuse and was subject to § 3283: “That a producer of child pornography will possess it at the\ntime of the abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing child\npornography itself does not involve an act against a child, i.e., the sexual abuse of a child.” Jd. at\n8l7.\n\nCoutentos demonstrates that the “offense involving” language of § 3283, as with other\nstatutes, requires the court to look to the elements of the offense, rather than the facts of a\nparticular case, to determine whether a particular offense “involves” the sexual or physical abuse\nor kidnapping of a child. /d. at 8l7. This approach makes practical sense: If the applicability of\n§ 3283 depended on the facts of a particular case, rather than the elements of the offense, the\ngovernment would effectively be required to prove conduct beyond the elements of the\noffense—i.e., that sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping occurred—in order to prove that its\ncharges are not time-barred.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2668", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of 23\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThis Memorandum of Law is submited in support of Ghislaine Maxwell’s Motion for a\nBill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures.’ Specifically, Ms. Maxwell requests:\n\ne a bill of particulars, pursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure;\n\ne disclosure of certain evidence within the possession of the government or its\n\nwitnesses;\n\ne immediate disclosure of exculpatory material under Brady v.

Rather than risk a mistrial, the Court should require a proffer\nfrom the government or conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.\nV. Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated disclosure of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and supervisory pouer to\nurge the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial. See United States v. Percevault, 49o\nF.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974). The circumstances of this case — the age of the offenses, the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l9 of 23\nlocation of witnesses, the ongoing global pandemic — justify the accelerated disclosure of Jencks\nAct material.\n\nThe Court has already recognized that the defense will need substantial time to evaluate\nand investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case. In response to the\ngovernment request to delay <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses until eight weeks prior to trial, the Court ruled that such a time frame was\n“insufficient” and ordered the government to produce the materials by March l2, 2o2l “to\nensure that the defense can adequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73). The defense has conferred\nwith the government and proposed the same date—March l2, 2o2l—+to produce all Jencks Act\nmaterial for both testifying and non-testifying witnesses. The government has denied that\nrequest. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the government to disclose all Jencks Act\nmaterial by that date, including, but not limited to the follouing:\n\nl. Any and all rough notes of witness interviews taken or obtained in any investigation\nof Ms. Maxwell, including federal, state, local and other investigations whether or not\nthe contents thereof have been incorporated in official reports;\n\n2. Any notes or memoranda made by government counsel, staff, or law enforcement\nagents during the interview of any witness intended to be called by the government in\nits direct case;\n\n3. Any emails, texts or voicemails (in original, transcribed and summary form) from the\nwitness and from the witness’s counsel/law firm containing information derived from\nany witness intended to be called by the government in its direct case; and\n\n4. Any emails, texts or voicemails (in original, transcribed and summary form) between\nand among government counsel and law enforcement officers containing information\nderived from any witness intended to be called by the government in its direct case.\n\nVI. Motion for a List of Government Witnesses\n\nIn conjunction with Ms. Maxwell’s request for early disclosure of Jencks Act material,\nthe defense also requests that the government provide a list of the witnesses it intends to call at\ntrial. Although Rule l6 does not require the government to disclose its witness prior to trial, the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 5 of l2\nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense\nspecifically enumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or\ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the\ncommunity or others. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”’).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>,” houever, “the presumption favoring\ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo277l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 6 of l2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44).

Finally, “Rule l7(c)\nsubpoenas may not issue prior to trial to obtain materials usable only to impeach.” United States\nv. Pena, No. l5 Cr. 55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6) (Nathan, J.)\n(granting motion to quash Rule l7(c) subpoena for all records relating to cooperating witnesses);\nsee also Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol (“Generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is\ninsufficient to require its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in advance of trial.”); Cherry, 876 F. Supp. at 553\n(“[D]ocuments are not evidentiary for Rule l7(c) purposes if their use is limited to impeachment.”).\nTHE SUBPOENA FAILS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nThe Defendant cannot demonstrate that the Subpoena meets Rule l7(c)’s requirements for\nfour, independent reasons. First, the Subpoena is overbroad and non-specific, and a clear fishing\nexpedition to “see what may turn up.” See United States v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG),\n2o2o WL 86768, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o) (denying motion for issuance of Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena). “Subpoenas seeking ‘any and all’ materials, without mention of ‘specific admissible\nevidence,’ justify the inference that the defense is engaging in the type of ‘fishing expedition’\nprohibited by Mixon.” United States v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2-5l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited) (granting motion to quash Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena).\n\nHere, the Subpoena plainly fails Nixon’s specificity requirement. Requests | through 5 all\nseek “communications” between “You” and a designated individual or entity, including the U.S.\nAtorney and BSF’s co-counsel, about a certain subject. The Subpoena defines “communications”\nas “all forms of correspondence, including regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or\nother writen communication of information of any kind,” and defines “You” as “any ouner,\nshareholder, partner or employee of Boies, Schiller, Flexner, LLP, including but not limited to\nDavid Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Peter Skinner and any former ouner, shareholder, partner or\nemployee, or independent contractor of the firm.” Such broad Requests are plainly overbroad and\nnon-specific, and do not meet the strict requirements of Rule l7(c). See, e.g., Mendinueta-Ibarro,\n956 F. Supp. 2d at 5l2-5l3 (quashing subpoena that requested “‘any and all writings and records’\nrelated to the [police department’s] contact with a particular confidential witness”); Pena, 2ol6\nWL 8735699, at *3 (Nathan, J.) (holding that defendant’s subpoena “for ‘any and all’ records\nassociated with the Government’s cooperating witnesses for an indefinite length of time takes an\nimpermissible shotgun approach to Rule l7(cy”’); United States v. Barnes, No. o4 Cr. l86 (SCR),\n2oo8 WL 9359654, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2oo8) (quashing motion that “blindly seeks ‘all’\ndocuments and records that fall into several categories for an approximate 23-month period rather\nthan identifiable pieces of evidence” because “[sJuch a blanket request implicates all of the\nproblems associated with a classic ‘fishing expedition’”); United States v.

Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 4 of 7\nbecause “the subpoena was not crafted to call for admissible evidence. Rather, it called for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the entire investigative file and is accurately described as a fishing expedition.”).\n\nSimilarly, Request l2 asks for “EVCP Material,” which is defined as “any submission to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims on behalf of\npersons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases\nsigned by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your Clients.” This\nRequest does not satisfy the Nixon standard—the Defendant is not a party or otherwise privy to\nwhat information BSF has submited to the confidential Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program\nor on behalf of which clients BSF has submited such information. The Defendant cannot merely\nrequest every piece of confidential information that BSF submited to the Program in the hopes\nthat something relevant and admissible turns up. This Request thus cannot pass muster under Rule\nl7(c).\n\nSecond, although BSF does not knou what arguments the Defendant made in her ex parte\nmotion, the documents and items requested in the Subpoena bear no apparent relevance to the\nDefendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges in this mater. And to the extent they would be\nrelevant solely for impeachment purposes, or relevant but inadmissible, the Defendant cannot\nobtain them in advance of trial pursuant to Rule l7(c). Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo, 7ol.\n\nRequest l seeks communications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney about the Defendant\nfrom 2ol5 through the present, and Requests 3 through 5 seek communications between BSF and\nBSF’s co-counsel from 2ol5 through the present regarding any meetings with the U.S. Atorney’s\noffice about the Defendant. But such communications are not relevant to the Government’s\nallegations that the Defendant enticed minors to travel, and transported minors, to engage in sex\nacts between l994 to l997, nearly 2o years prior to any such communications. Nor do such\ncommunications bear any apparent relevance to whether the Defendant perjured herself in a civil\ndeposition. If such communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s false\nnarrative that BSF somehou colluded with the Government—an allegation that could serve no\nother purpose than impeachment of the Government’s potential witnesses. Request 8—seeking\nany grand jury subpoena for documents related to litigation concerning the\nDefendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed narrative of collusion between\nBSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly\nproviding the Government with confidential documents governed by a protective order in a\nseparate civil mater. See, e.g., ECF No. l34 (Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained\nby subpoena to what appears JM).” Even if these documents were relevant to anything other\nRequests 3 through 5 also seek protected work product. Those Requests seek\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in several maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell. Such communications were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\nWhere a criminal defendant seeks to subpoena work product, the defendant can only overcome the\nprivilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” for the requested items and that he “cannot,\nwithout undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.” United States v.\nWeisberg, No. o8-CR-347 NGG RML, 2oll WL l327689, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2oll). Given\nthe marginal potential evidentiary value of the communications, the Defendant will be unable to\ndemonstrate a substantial need for protected communications between BSF and its co-counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002818.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83 Filed o3/26/2l Page /7of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 7 of 7\nMaterial,” which is clearly sought for impeachment purposes, is not a proper subject of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena.\n\nThird, certain of the documents that the Defendant seeks to obtain from BSF are “otherwise\nprocurable” from the Government. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699 (documents requested pursuant to Rule\nl7(c) must not be “otherwise procurable” from another source). Requests l and 2 both seek\ncommunications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney, which the Defendant can procure from the\nGovernment. Similarly, Request 8 seeks a Grand Jury Subpoena that gg by the\nGovernment itself, and that the Defendant can therefore procure from the Government. Thus, a\nRule l7(c) subpoena to BSF for those documents is improper. See, e.g., United States v. Bergstein,\nNo. l6 Cr. 746 (PKC), 2ol7 WL 6887596, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2ol7) (‘““When ‘many’ of the\nsubpoenaed materials are obtainable through the discovery process, a subpoena contravenes\nNixon’s requirement that subpoenaed materials must not be otherwise procurable in advance of\ntrial by the exercise of due diligence.”); United States v.

Feb. 24, 2oo9) (quashing a l7(c) subpoena where it was “likely that many\nof the documents that defendant seeks in his subpoena are obtainable from another source—the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office—with litle or no diligence required”).\n\nFinally, Requests lo and ll seek items that can be produced at trial if they are shoun to be\nrelevant and admissible. Request lo seeks a pair of couboy boots that the Defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein purchased for Annie Farmer for inspection and copying. Request ll seeks the original\ncopies of various photographs of Annie Farmer when she was a teenager, of Maria Farmer on\nLeslie Wexner’s property, of Virginia Giuffre on various of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nproperties, and of Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew, and the Defendant in the Defendant’s London\ntounhome. Although the relevance of these items is minimal—the photographs, for example, do\nnot appear to depict any conduct or event described in the indictment—the Defendant cannot shou\nthat she “cannot properly prepare for trial without such <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and inspection in advance of\ntrial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial,” which\nis an independent requirement under Nixon. 4l8 U.S. at 699. There is simply no reason why, if\nthe Farmers and Ms. Giuffre ultimately testify and if these items prove to be relevant and\nadmissible, these items cannot be produced for inspection at trial.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to authorize service of the\nSubpoena on BSF should be denied\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S.

Supp. at 553\n(“[D]ocuments are not evidentiary for Rule l7(c) purposes if their use is limited to impeachment.”).\nTHE SUBPOENA FAILS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nThe Defendant cannot demonstrate that the Subpoena meets Rule l7(c)’s requirements for\nfour, independent reasons. First, the Subpoena is overbroad and non-specific, and a clear fishing\nexpedition to “see what may turn up.” See United States v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG),\n2o2o WL 86768, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o) (denying motion for issuance of Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena). “Subpoenas seeking ‘any and all’ materials, without mention of ‘specific admissible\nevidence,’ justify the inference that the defense is engaging in the type of ‘fishing expedition’\nprohibited by Nixon.” United States v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2-5l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited) (granting motion to quash Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena).\n\nHere, the Subpoena plainly fails Nixon’s specificity requirement. Requests l through 5 all\nseek “communications” between “You” and a designated individual or entity, including the U.S.\nAtorney and BSF’s co-counsel, about a certain subject. The Subpoena defines “communications”\nas “all forms of correspondence, including regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or\nother writen communication of information of any kind,” and defines “You” as “any ouner,\nshareholder, partner or employee of Boies, Schiller, Flexner, LLP, including but not limited to\nDavid Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Peter Skinner and any former ouner, shareholder, partner or\nemployee, or independent contractor of the firm.” Such broad Requests are plainly overbroad and\nnon-specific, and do not meet the strict requirements of Rule l7(c). See, e.g., Mendinueta-Ibarro,\n956 F. Supp. 2d at 5l2-5l3 (quashing subpoena that requested “‘any and all writings and records’\nrelated to the [police department’s] contact with a particular confidential witness”); Pena, 2ol6\nWL 8735699, at *3 (Nathan, J.)

Rather, it called for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the entire investigative file and is accurately described as a fishing expedition.”).\n\nSimilarly, Request l2 asks for “EVCP Material,” which is defined as “any submission to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including amy claims on behalf of\npersons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases\nsigned by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your Clients.” This\nRequest does not satisfy the Nixon standard—the Defendant is not a party or otherwise privy to\nwhat information BSF has submited to the confidential Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program\nor on behalf of which clients BSF has submited such information. The Defendant cannot merely\nrequest every piece of confidential information that BSF submited to the Program in the hopes\nthat something relevant and admissible turns up. This Request thus cannot pass muster under Rule\nl7(c).\n\nSecond, although BSF does not knou what arguments the Defendant made in her ex parte\nmotion, the documents and items requested in the Subpoena bear no apparent relevance to the\nDefendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges in this mater. And to the extent they would be\nrelevant solely for impeachment purposes, or relevant but inadmissible, the Defendant cannot\nobtain them in advance of trial pursuant to Rule l7(c). Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo, 7ol.\n\nRequest l seeks communications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney about the Defendant\nfrom 2ol5 through the present, and Requests 3 through 5 seek communications between BSF and\nBSF’s co-counsel from 2ol5 through the present regarding any meetings with the U.S. Atorney’s\noffice about the Defendant. But such communications are not relevant to the Government’s\nallegations that the Defendant enticed minors to travel, and transported minors, to engage in sex\nacts between l994 to l997, nearly 2o years prior to any such communications. Nor do such\ncommunications bear any apparent relevance to whether the Defendant perjured herself in a civil\ndeposition. If such communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s false\nnarrative that BSF somehou colluded with the Government—an allegation that could serve no\nother purpose than impeachment of the Government’s potential witnesses. Request 8—seeking\nany grand jury subpoena issued to BSF for documents related to litigation concerning the\nDefendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed narrative of collusion between\nBSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly\nproviding the Government with confidential documents governed by a protective order in a\nseparate civil mater. See, e.g., ECF No. l34 (Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained\nby subpoena to what appears to be BSF).” Even if these documents were relevant to anything other\nRequests 3 through 5 also seek protected work product. Those Requests seek\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in several maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell. Such communications were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\nWhere a criminal defendant seeks to subpoena work product, the defendant can only overcome the\nprivilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” for the requested items and that he “cannot,\nwithout undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.” United States v.\nWeisberg, No. o8-CR-347 NGG RML, 2oll WL l327689, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2oll). Given\nthe marginal potential evidentiary value of the communications, the Defendant will be unable to\ndemonstrate a substantial need for protected communications between BSF and its co-counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo288o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl9l Filed o3/3o/2l Page/7of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699 (documents requested pursuant to Rule\nl7(c) must not be “otherwise procurable” from another source). Requests l and 2 both seek\ncommunications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney, which the Defendant can procure from the\nGovernment. Similarly, Request 8 seeks a Grand Jury Subpoena that was served on BSF by the\nGovernment itself, and that the Defendant can therefore procure from the Government. Thus, a\nRule l7(c) subpoena to BSF for those documents is improper. See, e.g., United States v. Bergstein,\nNo. l6 Cr. 746 (PKC), 2ol7 WL 6887596, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.

Request lo seeks a pair of couboy boots that the Defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein purchased for Annie Farmer for inspection and copying. Request ll seeks the original\ncopies of various photographs of Annie Farmer when she was a teenager, of Maria Farmer on\nLeslie Wexner’s property, of Virginia Giuffre on various of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nproperties, and of Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew, and the Defendant in the Defendant’s London\ntounhome. Although the relevance of these items is minimal—the photographs, for example, do\nnot appear to depict any conduct or event described in the indictment—the Defendant cannot shou\nthat she “cannot properly prepare for trial without such <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and inspection in advance of\ntrial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial,” which\nis an independent requirement under Nixon. 4l8 U.S. at 699. There is simply no reason why, if\nthe Farmers and Ms. Giuffre ultimately testify and if these items prove to be relevant and\nadmissible, these items cannot be produced for inspection at trial.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to authorize service of the\nSubpoena on BSF should be denied\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S.

For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe Court (l) direct the defendant to provide the Government with a copy of the proposed subpoena\nto BSF and notice of all existing and future applications for subpoenas under Rule l7(c) returnable\nin advance of trial, and (2) direct that any productions made in response to Rule l7(c) subpoenas\nbe produced to the opposing party and marked confidential under the protective order.\nI. Background\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has produced to the defendant more than 2.7 million\npages of discovery pursuant to the Government’s various discovery obligations, including Rule\nl6. The parties are also in discussions about the timing of further productions by the Government,\nincluding material provided pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 35oo and Giglio material.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo289o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl95 Filed o4/o5/2l Page2ofll\nPage 2\n\nThose obligations, and not Rule l7 subpoenas, provide the avenue through which\ndefendants in criminal cases obtain discovery. As the Supreme Court has explained, “i]t was not\nintended by Rule l6 to give a limited right of discovery, and then by Rule l7 to give a right of\ndiscovery in the broadest terms.” Bouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l);\nsee also United States v. Purin, 486 F.2d l363, l368 (2d Cir. l973) (“A subpoena duces tecum in\na criminal case is not intended as a means of discovery.”). Unlike the rules of civil procedure—\npermiting the issuance of subpoenas to seek <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents or materials which, although\nthemselves not admissible, may lead to admissible evidence—the criminal rules do not authorize\nthe issuance of such broad pretrial subpoenas under Rule l7. See United States v. Cherry, 876 F.\nSupp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. l995); United States v. Gross, 24 F.R.D. l38, l4l (S.D.N.Y. l959)\n(Rule l7(c) cannot be used “to obtain leads as to the existence of additional documentary evidence\nor to seek information relating to the defendant’s case. This type of discovery, permissible under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, has not been authorized for criminal trials.”).\n\nThe purpose of Rule l7(c) is to “expedite the trial by providing a time and place before\ntrial for the inspection of” specific materials that the parties intend to offer into evidence.

Notice of Rule l7(c) subpoenas is similarly appropriate in this case to prevent abuse\nand address objections expediently. And such a requirement is consistent with the plain language\nof Rule l7: while Rule l7(b) expressly provides for an ex parte procedure for indigent defendants\nseeking to subpoena a witness for trial, it makes no such provision for an application for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents and objects pursuant to Rule l7(c).4\n\n‘In Ray, the Court concluded that Rule l7(c) is simply an extension of Rules l7(a) and (b)’s\nprovisions of subpoenas to witnesses, which may issue without notice.

Further, the Government\nplans to produce Jencks Act and Giglio material for testifying witnesses six weeks in advance of\ntrial, which will provide the defense with far more time than is typical in this District for review\nof such material. Given that the defense has had discovery in this case for months, will have\nmonths with non-testifying witness statements, and will have more than one month with Jencks\nAct and Giglio material, there is every reason to believe that the defense will provide excellent\nrepresentation to the defendant at trial as scheduled beginning July l2, 2o2l.\n\nIn light of the ample time that remains before trial and the steps the Government has\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 2 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial.

Counts\nFive and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.l\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Is Irrelevant to This Case\n\nThe defendant seeks to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement\n(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (the “USAO-SDFL”). (Def. Mot. l). She does so despite the fact that: (l) she did not\nnegotiate the NPA, was not a party to the NPA, and her name is not contained anywhere in the\ndocument; and (2) her crimes are not identified or named in any way in the NPA. Essentially, the\ndefendant claims she is immune from prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period,\nanywhere, in the United States, based on the language of a document that does not name her and\nwhich she did not sign. Moreover, she seeks to enforce the NPA against a U.S. Atorney’s Office\nthat did not negotiate the NPA and is not bound by it.\n\nThe defendant’s arguments are meritless, and the Court should reject them. As a threshold\nmater, under the well-setled law of this Circuit, the NPA is not enforceable in this District,\nbecause the USAO-SDFL’s agreement with Jeffrey Epstein is not binding on the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York (the “USAO-SDNY”). Moreover, even if the NPA\napplied to this District—which it does not—the NPA does not immunize the defendant from\nprosecution for the crimes charged in the Indictment. Finally, because the defendant has failed to\n' As the Government has repeatedly indicated, the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s co-\nconspirators remains ongoing. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated Aug. 2l, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 46; Gov’t\nLeter dated Oct. 6, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 6o; Gov’t Leter dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65). To the\nextent that investigation results in additional charges against the defendant, the Government\nintends to seek any superseding indictment at least three months in advance of trial. The\nGovernment does not anticipate that any new charges would require the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of any\nadditional discovery.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2964", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 239\nto the instant prosecution, is insufficient to shou actual prejudice. .. . The fact that evidence may\nbe lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment stage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the\nduration. Furthermore, there has been no allegation in this case that the destruction of the records\nwas deliberate on the part of either the government or trustee.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nLastly, the defendant contends that prejudicial media reporting and inappropriate pre-trial\npublicity from at least 2oll through the present has resulted in prejudice to the defendant. (Def.\nMot. at l4). She claims that had the Government brought charges against her between l996 and\n2oll, the Government “would have not prevailed,” noting that the defendant’s accusers would not\nhave been “able to conform their ‘memories’ to the often republished ‘obvious lies.’” (/d. at l5).\nThis argument, like the others contained in this motion, is steeped in speculation. The defendant\ncites not one case in support of her argument that pre-trial publicity can ever establish actual\nprejudice, nor does she point to any evidence that the Government fomented such publicity dating\nback to 2oll. To the extent the defendant is concerned about pretrial publicity, she will have the\nopportunity to propose an appropriate examination of potential jurors during voir dire to identify\na panel of impartial jurors who have not been prejudiced by any publicity this case may have\ngarnered.\n\nIn short, the defendant’s complaints are nothing more than the type of self-serving, vague,\nspeculative, and conclusory claims of prejudice that courts have consistently rejected as\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment delay.'!? The motion should\ntherefore be denied.\n\n'° The defendant also complains about the Government’s failure to “provide discovery adequate\nto fully investigate the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 7). Among the\nitems the defense complains about not receiving in discovery are the names and dates of birth of\nthe Minor Victims, the specific location of any overt act, the date of any overt act, any witness\nstatements, or any corroboration of any allegation in the Indictment. (/d.). As described herein,\nsee Section X, infra, the Government has made substantial discovery productions pursuant to Rule\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from disclosure to the Government would normally be more\ndifficult to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his\nprivilege and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S. 338, 343 (l974)). “Wide latitude in gathering evidence\nis vital to the grand jury’s investigative function.” Jd. at 422; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S.\n665, 688 (l972) (“Although the pouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 239\npublic interest” which resulted in the Government convening a grand jury to investigate a serious\ncrime. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22-23). The Court also noted that because the investigation was not\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify\nand to produce documents] . . . would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related Application.”\n(id. at 23-24). The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request\nwas made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents as part of\nan ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri\nwhere the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the\nstate Atorney General’s motion to intervene to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. ll at l4).\nMaxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court\nerred by not expressly finding that the state had shoun improvidence, extraordinary circumstances,\nor compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,\n866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.\n\nJudge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary\nfindings on this point. That two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed\nthe law, and reached varying conclusions based on different findings shous that there are\nguardrails in place to ensure compliance with Martindell. In other words, the Government in no\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll7 of 239\n\nThe defendant repeatedly argues that the Government’s failure to mention AUSA-l’s prior\ncontact with Boies Schiller in 2ol6 was a misrepresentation that led to the modification of the\nprotective order. The argument, which relies principally on hyperbolic rhetoric, is simply\nincorrect. As an initial mater, the Government did not insist, contrary to Maxwell’s twisted\nreading of the transcript, that “there had been no contact whatsoever” between Boies Schiller and\nthe Government at any time prior to the Government opening its investigation. (Def. Mot. 3 at l).\nInstead, Chief Judge McMahon’s question was more specific: referencing Chemical Bank and the\ndesire to avoid “a Chemical Bank kind of situation,” Chief Judge McMahon asked about contacts\nbetween the two parties “prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation.”\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added); see also Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (omiting the italicized portion\nof the question)). In response, the Government described accurately its communications with\nBoies Schiller that had occurred in the time period surrounding the opening of its investigation and\nthe issuance of the subpoena. Additionally, and in light of the Government’s prior arguments to\nChief Judge McMahon relating to Chemical Bank,*® the Government atempted to address the\nmisconduct at issue in that case: namely the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of confidential documents without seeking\nmodification of a protective order by confirming that, here, no such <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> had yet occurred.\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2) (noting that Boies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there\n* See, e.g., Exs. 8 & 9 at 2-3 (discussing Chemical Bank as rejecting a contempt request where a\nparty “compl[ied] with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order” and\nfocusing arguments on the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents); (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l5) (the\nGovernment describing Chemical Bank as “essentially say[ing]: You should have asked, but of\ncourse this is fine for you to disclose this information to the government based on the validly issued\ngrand jury subpoena”); cf. (id. at 4 (Chief Judge McMahon describing Chemical Bank as saying\n“the proper procedure [for the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents] is for somebody to make a motion to be\nrelieved from the terms of the protective order”), 2o (Chief Judge McMahon stating that “in the\nChemical Bank case, it all was ex post facto and it all happened’’)).\n\n9o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 239\nelement which influences a criminal suspect to make incriminating admissions.” /d. The question\nis not whether a witness was encouraged to speak, but whether his “free will,” when he spoke,\n“was overborne.” /d. at l88; see also, e.g., United States v. Corbet, 75o F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir.\n2ol4).\n\nIt follous that the Government need not inform a witness of the nature of its investigation,\nsee United States v. Okwumabua, 828 F.2d 95o, 953 (2d Cir. l987), much less his individual status\nin the investigation, see Washington, 43l U.S. at l89 & l9o n.6. The Constitution does not\n“require that the police supply a suspect with a flou of information to help him calibrate his self-\ninterest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights.” Colorado v. Spring, 479 U.S. 564,\n576-77 (l987) (internal quotation marks omited); see also, e.g., id. at 577 (there is no requirement\nthat law enforcement give information that might affect “the wisdom” of speaking). Nor does the\nConstitution require that someone be questioned only in the manner most likely to ensure that he\ngives the decision whether to speak careful thought. See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 66o F.3d\nl49, l57 (2d Cir. 2oll) (‘the Fifth Amendment does not protect against hard choices” (internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Mullens, 536 F.2d 997, looo (2d Cir. l976) (there is a\ndifference between “those choices which are physically or psychologically coerced and those\nwhich are merely difficult’).\n\nIn short, the Fifth Amendment is only violated by “government misconduct” that is\n“coercive.” Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. l57, l63 (l986); see also Oregon v.

Mot. ll at l6), this case is distinguishable from\nUnited States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). There, the defendant had already been\nindicted at the time of his deposition in a civil case, “was reluctant to be deposed because of the\npending indictment, and he agreed only after the parties in the civil case stipulated that the\ndeposition would be sealed.” /d. at 699-7oo. The court found that the subpoenas for the deposition\ntranscript were “unenforceable” because the “government has not argued that the protective order\nwas improvidently granted or that there are some extraordinary circumstances or compelling need,\nin view of the holding in Martindell.”* Id. at 7ol. The court found that the protective order served\nthe “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted\nthe use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the\ndeposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 7oo; see also\nBotha v. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 7587 (JGK), l998 WL 88745 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n27, l998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government obtained an\nindictment against witness “long before his deposition in the civil action” and where federal\ncriminal case remains pending after civil action is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge\nMcMahon found that the “Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary\ncircumstances, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).\nAs she noted in her opinion, the situation was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was\ntrolling for evidence to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal\ninvestigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As Chief Judge McMahon already\nconcluded, Oshatz does not warrant a different result here.\n‘3 In Martindell, the Second Circuit explicitly deemed it “unnecessary for us to decide the Fifth\nAmendment issues raised by the parties.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297.\n\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 239\n\nThe defendant argues that Martindell “authorized her to give deposition testimony under\nthe shield of the Protective Order without worrying whether the government could ‘insinuate itself”\ninto the case and use her oun words against her.” (Def. Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4. The Government Did Not Violate Maxwell’s Due Process Rights\n\nThe defendant also claims that the Government’s conduct “cannot be squared with\nelemental due process.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4 (citing U.S. Const. amend. V)). This claim is meritless.\nBecause there was no Government misconduct—let alone the type of outrageous Government\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 239\neC\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee and the Government has provided the defense with the\nbirth month and year of each minor victim.”\n\nIn other words, as the Government has previously indicated, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about the three minor victims to permit her to\nprepare for trial. The discovery also provides the defense the ability to identify specific private\nplane flights that are relevant to the Indictment. Any remaining detail regarding the specifics of\nabuse, particular interactions, and additional trips will come from witness testimony. As is to be\nexpected when describing events more than two decades in the past, that testimony will provide\napproximate time periods when events occurred, rather than specific dates. Given the information\nthe defendant already has from the discovery, the Indictment, and the Government’s court filings\n(including this memorandum), any additional detail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, allouing the defendant to tailor any testimony to the Government’s case.

In this memorandum, the Government has\nsummarized hou the defendant’s false statements during her deposition were material to the\npending civil litigation. See Section V, supra. Perhaps more importantly, the defendant personally\nparticipated in that civil litigation, and she is undoubtedly quite familiar with it.\n\nTogether, the discovery productions, briefing in which the Government has described\naspects of its evidence and theory (see, e.g., Government Memorandum in Opposition to Renewed\nBail Motion, Dec. l8, 2o2o, Dkt. No. loo, at 8-l2), the contents of this memorandum, and the\ndetails contained in the Indictment more than adequately inform the defendant of the charges\nagainst her. This is simply not a case where the “relevance of key events [are] shrouded in\nmystery.” See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574. Accordingly, the Court should deny the motion for a\nbill of particulars.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Requests for Early <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> of a Witness List and Jencks\n\nAct Material Should Be Denied\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 “does not require the Government to furnish the\nnames and addresses of its witnesses in general.” United States v. Bejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39 (2d\n63 Although the victims’ identities are clear from the discovery, and the defendant’s motion makes\nclear that she strongly suspects their identities, there is no basis to require the Government to turn\nover the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in advance of its Jencks Act\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, which is customary in this District. See Section X.B., infra.\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 239\nCir. l99o). Thus, “‘[iJn the absence of a specific shouing that disclosure [of a witness list] [is]\nboth material to the preparation of [the] defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances\nsurrounding [the] case,’ the request for a witness list should be denied.” United States v. Russo,\n483 F. Supp. 2d 3ol, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (quoting Bejasa, 9o4 F.2d at l39-4o). “Courts in the\nSecond Circuit typically deny motions for the early disclosure of witness lists where, as here,\nDefendants have not made a specific shouing of need.” United States v. Rivera, No. l6 Cr. l75\n(LGS), 2ol7 WL l8433o2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol7). The claim that “given the complexity\nof the case, disclosure of the government witness list will level the playing field” amounts to an\n“abstract statement of need” that does not justify provision of a witness list. Russo, 483 F. Supp.\n2d at 3o9.\n\nThe Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C. § 35oo, covers disclosure of statements or reports made by\nGovernment witnesses, and the rule mandates that such materials not be the subject of discovery\nor inspection “until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.” l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo(a); see also United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l45 (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he Jencks\nAct prohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.”); United\nStates v.

Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks Act material in light of Coppa).\n\nTypically in this District, and as is the case here, the Government confirms that it will\nproduce 35oo material and Giglio (or impeachment) material reasonably in advance of trial, and\nwill engage in good faith discussions with the defense regarding a schedule for pretrial disclosures.\nSee United States v. Sergentakis, No. o5 Cr. 23o (JFK), 2oo5 WL l994ol4, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y.\nAug. l7, 2oo5) (“l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(b) calls for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Government witness statements after\nthe witness ‘has testified on direct examination.’ The Government response . . . that ‘[c]Jonsistent\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 239\n\nto review the statements of testifying witnesses. The Government remains open to engaging in\ngood faith discussions with the defense to mutually agree on a schedule for reciprocal pretrial\ndisclosures.“ Accordingly, the motion for a witness list and early <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks Act\nmaterial should be denied.\n\nc.

The Government has\nconfirmed that it also inculpates the defendant. The Government has, houever, identified a single\nline i i _ that could arguably be considered helpful to\nthe defense.© With the possible exception of that one line, there is nothing exculpatory contained\n6 The Government has requested reciprocal discovery from the defendant and, to date, she has\nproduced nothing.\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 239\nthese interviews constitute witness statements covered by the Jencks Act and are not subject to\ndisclosure by statute until after each witness has completed direct examination at trial. See l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo. As noted above, houever, the Government fully intends to provide all Jencks Act\nmaterial of both testifying and non-testifying witnesses, which will of course include the records\nrelating to these interviews, to the defense multiple weeks in advance of trial. The Government\nrespectfully submits that is sufficient to meet its obligations with respect to these documents, and\nthe defendant’s motion for their immediate disclosure should be denied.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s request for an unredacted copy of the FBI report atached to the\nDefense Motion as Exhibit C should be denied as moot because the Government has already\nproduced an unredacted copy of that report to the defense. (Def. Mot. lo at 8-9).

Out of an abundance of caution, today the Government has informed defense counsel\nOrn cr\n6° Notably, the unredacted report does not contain ed\na demonstrating that defense counsel’s speculation about\nsupposed Brady material lurking beneath redactions is inaccurate. The redacted copy defense\ncounsel atached as Exhibit C was recovered during the execution of a search warrant for one of\nEpstein’s devices and was produced to defense counsel in the form in which it was recovered from\nthe device. In other words, defense counsel has received two copies of this same document: the\nredacted version that Epstein had on one of his devices, and the unredacted version from the FBI’s\nfiles.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l4 of 239\nGovernment has reviewed the full report and confirmed that there is nothing exculpatory contained\ntherein. To the contrary, the report inculpates the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant is not\nentitled to its immediate disclosure.

(Def. Mot. lo at\nlo). Leaving aside the fact that the defense cites no authority for the proposition that the\nGovernment has an obligation to obtain the personal papers of a third party, see United States v.\nCollins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“The Government’s ‘Brady obligations extend\nonly to materials within prosecutors’ possession, custody or control or, in appropriate cases, that\nof the Department of Justice, perhaps another part of the Executive Branch, or a comparable state\nauthority involved in the federal prosecution.’” (quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 3o8 F. Supp.\n3d 736, 742 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8))), the Government has already represented that it has asked the third\nparty at issue about the materials the defendant purports to seek and that no such materials exist.\nIn particular, to the extent the defense is concerned with whether there are diary entries from the\nspring of l996, the Government has already indicated in response to the defendant’s second bail\nmotion that it is aware of none. (See Dkt. No. loo at ll n. 2 (“Because this victim stopped writing\nin her journal about a month after that first meeting with Epstein, there are no entries regarding the\nsubsequent trip she took months later to visit Epstein, during which she met the defendant.

See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); Dkt. No. 68. The Government recognizes its continuing obligation to\ndisclose any Brady material, and to make a diligent search for any relevant material that may be\nin the possession of the prosecution team, including investigating agents and officers. As the\nGovernment has already emphasized in this case, the Government takes its disclosure obligations\nvery seriously and has commited to being transparent with the Court and the defense regarding its\napproach to obtaining and reviewing files, including other agency files, that may be relevant to\nthis case. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated October 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63). Consistent with that\ncommitment, the Government has completed an initial review of its files for Brady material and\nRule l6 material and has produced more than 2.7 million pages of discovery as a result of that\nreview. These productions have included specific disclosures of certain witness statements that\nmay arguably be exculpatory. The Government also intends to produce all statements and potential\nimpeachment material in its possession regarding any potential witness identified during its\ninvestigation, including those individuals whom the Government does not intend to call at trial.\nAs discussed belou, the Government is in the process of reviewing all files in its possession for\npotential impeachment material. The Government remains cognizant of its Brady obligations and\nwill promptly produce any potentially exculpatory material if any is identified during that review.\n\nThe Government is not currently aware of any undisclosed Brady material in its possession,\nbut it will certainly provide timely disclosure of any additional Brady material if any such material\ncomes to light. Courts in this Circuit routinely deny specific requests for Brady material where,\nas here, the Government has made a good-faith representation to the court and defense counsel\nthat it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations under Brady. See, e.g.,\nThompson, 2ol3 WL 6246489 at *9 (“In light of the Government's ‘good-faith representation to\nl89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 239\n\nthe court and defense counsel that it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations\nunder Brady,’ defendants’ request for immediate or otherwise early\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Brady materials is denied.” (internal citation omited) (quoting United States v.\nPerez, 94o F.

Oct. l2, 2ol6) (“The Government represents that it is aware of its\nobligation under Brady; that it has complied; and will continue to comply. That is sufficient to\ndeny Defendants’ motion for Brady relief.” (internal citations omited)). Given the Government’s\nextensive efforts to review its files for any material warranting disclosure, and its commitment to\ncontinue meeting its disclosure obligations, the motion should be denied.\n\nFor similar reasons, the motion for disclosure of Giglio material should be denied as\npremature. The Government is fully aware of its obligation to disclose impeachment material, is\nin the process of reviewing all files in its possession for any such material, and will produce any\nsuch material several weeks in advance of trial. As noted above, that is consistent with governing\nlaw in this Circuit, and the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that she is entitled to\nsuch material as much as four months in advance of trial. Courts in this Circuit have repeatedly\nrefused to compel disclosure of impeachment or Giglio material well in advance of trial, and the\ndefense has provided no particularized basis for even earlier disclosure here.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 348\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “‘conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers.7™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo338o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which involve this matier, please contact the offics listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 265 of 348\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters.

The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners. Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l8.\n\n4o9 Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l9, l22l.\n26l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3463", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3489", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003544.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lof6\nPs SN U.S. Department of Justice\nNS, United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na protective order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In sucha case, ““[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’\"” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 5 (“This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—trelied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v.

It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. l77) (defining\n“confidential” information as, in sum and substance, medical and psychological information,\npersonal identifying information, and information relating to sexual activity or sexual contact).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3552", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na protective order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In such a case, “‘[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’*” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 6 (“This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—relied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed.

The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte declaration in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations.

The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9ofl6\n\nThe defamation litigation was legally very complicated and New York law afforded\nmany statutory, common law, and constitutional defenses to Ms. Maxwell (which may become\nrelevant at another time). In addition to strong legal defenses Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was\nexceptional. It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of Giuffre’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action. Very quickly there were\nmany provable “obvious lies.” A few examples:\n\ne Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her\nfiance long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell and held a number of jobs in 2ool\nand 2oo2.\n\ne Giuffre’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2ooo when she was l7, not l5.\n(This falsity was important to Giuffre’s story for many reasons.)\n\ne Palm Beach Police investigation revealed no evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in\nsexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> or possession of child\npornography.\n\ne No nude photograph of Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’s home.\n\ne Giuffre’s tales about foreign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.\n\ne All ofthe famous people Giuffre claimed to have been sexually trafficked to denied these\nclaims, which were completely implausible.\n\nImportantly, Giuffre post-dates the allegations contained in the superseding indictment\n(“Indictment”) by three years. By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong connection with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries. The parties disagreed about the scope and\nmeaning of virtually all of Judge Sweet’s discovery orders, including those related to Ms.\nMaxwell’s depositions. Significantly, Judge Sweet’s Order prefaced all the listed categories with\nthe words “sexual activity” an “sexual activities.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page lo of l4\n\nJane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation is also directly relevant to the discovery\ndisputes currently pending in this case. The Government has raised various relevancy objections\nto the documents that Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 are atempting to obtain. The current\nvictims have responded by explaining hou these documents are relevant, including explaining\nhou these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his pouerful political and\nsocial connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government’s\nmotive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims’ claims in an effort to\nmaintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims’ knouledge. See, e.g.,\n\nDE 266 at 6-lo. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation will help prove the relevancy of\nthese requests, as well as the need for those requests.\n\nOne clear example is Request for <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> No. 8, which seeks documents regarding\nEpstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea\narrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince\nAndrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershouitz. Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2\nhave alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the\nnon-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and\npolitical connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See,\n\ne.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at l6-l8). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knouledge of\nEpstein’s connection with some of these pouerful! people and thus hou Epstein might have used\nthem to secure favorable treatment.\n\nAdding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings.

That <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, dated\nNovember l8, 2o2o, included approximately l.2 million documents (totaling approximately 2.2\nmillion pages), all of which are text searchable and were produced in a format conducive to loading\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> into a document review platform.?

The defense did not request to review\nthose materials until March 2o2l, after which the Government coordinated with defense counsel,\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals to arrange for multiple days in April\n2o2l during which all of the materials were made available for review. The Government is of\ncourse willing to make similar arrangements should defense counsel believe additional review of\nthose materials is necessary.\n3 Only yesterday did defense counsel provide the Government with a list of documents that the\ndefendant has been unable to review from the prior discovery productions. As it has done in the\npast when such issues have been raised, the Government will work with its staff and staff at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to address these issues as expeditiously as possible. The\nGovernment notes, houever, that had defense counsel raised these specific issues earlier, the\nGovernment could have addressed them much sooner.\nSimilarly, the defense only raised concerns about metadata on certain photographs this month,\neven though those photographs were produced to the defense in November 2o2o. The Government\nis working with its staff and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into and, where possible,\naddress the defense’s concerns as quickly as possible.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3947", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page6oflo\nPage 6\n\nparticular to the time period covered by the S2 Indictment, especially with the guidance provided\nby the Government regarding key documents relevant to Minor Victim-4. Given that the largest\nportion of the discovery in this case is text searchable, the defense will also be able to tailor any\nre-review of those materials through relevant search terms. The combination of having already\npossessed the relevant discovery for months and receiving a list of key documents should\nmeaningfully assist the defense in preparing for trial as scheduled.\n\nThe Government has also commited to providing further disclosures well in advance of\ntrial and far earlier than such productions would ordinarily be made in this District. The\nGovernment has already begun producing materials relating to witnesses whom it does not intend\nto call at trial to the defense, more than three months in advance of trial. The bulk of those\nmaterials were produced on April l3, 2o2l, and the Government intends to make additional\nproductions on a rolling basis as it continues to review its files for such materials. In this vein, the\nGovernment has produced materials, including prior witness statements, for approximately 225\nindividuals relevant to the Government’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, and\nothers. While the Government made this <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> with an expansive eye touard its pretrial\ndisclosures, as it has adopted throughout the pendency of this mater, it bears noting that a\nsignificant majority of those individuals never mentioned or knew the defendant. Indeed, the\nnumber of non-testifying witnesses who mentioned the defendant makes up a small portion of the\noverall <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. That is unsurprising, given that the Government conducted a broad\ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, including crimes that did not involve this defendant.\nAccordingly, to the extent the defense claims it nou needs to investigate or interview all, or even\nthe majority of these witnesses, it is unclear hou that testimony would be relevant or admissible\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3948", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page 7 of lo\nPage 7\nat trial. Simply put, the defense does not need to investigate crimes with which the defendant is\nnot charged.\n\nMoreover, the defense’s most recent leter refers to these materials as somehou\nconstituting Brady material without any explanation of what information within the most recent\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is supposedly exculpatory. But given that, as noted above, a significant majority of the\nnon-testifying witness materials do not reference the defendant, to the extent the defense is\nsuggesting that the existence of victims who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein without assistance\nfrom the defendant constitutes Brady material, the Government has repeatedly noted that such\nevidence is not exculpatory. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 65 at l-2; Dkt. No. 2o4 at 47-48 (citing, inter\nalia, United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A defendant may not seek to\nestablish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal acts on specific\noccasions.”’))). Regardless, the defense has ample time to review these materials in advance of\ntrial, and the Government intended to produce all of these materials to the defense with or without\na superseding indictment.* Thus, the defense would have needed to review and investigate these\nmaterials even if the Government never obtained the S2 Indictment. Although the defense claims\n4 The Government understands from defense counsel that the CD containing a copy of this\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, which the Government sent to the MDC via FedEx overnight shipping last week, has\nnot been provided to the defendant. The Government has repeatedly asked MDC legal counsel to\nlocate this CD and provide it to the defendant, and today MDC legal counsel confirmed that the\nCD would be delivered to the defendant this afternoon.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has gone to significant lengths to address the technical\nissues defense counsel have raised with respect to the discovery, and to ensure that the defendant\nexpeditiously receives copies of each <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. Indeed, in November 2o2o, the undersigned\nhand delivered a laptop and discovery <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to the MDC for the defendant, and the\nGovernment understands the defendant received those items that same day.

Those files consist of 28 boxes,\nwhich contain material relating both to the investigation of Epstein and a civil lawsuit filed by\nvictims challenging the NPA under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. The Government hired a\nvendor to scan the files in these boxes, but technical difficulties with that vendor prevented those\nscans from being loaded into a document review platform until several weeks ago.

Each item sought by the subpoena is identified with specificity and is admissible as\nrelevant evidence in this case. The Court should therefore deny BSF’s Motion to Quash\n(“Motion”) (Dkt.

BSF proffered that they “submited claims and supporting evidence to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of several Epstein survivors who have not\nmade separate claims against Maxwell.” Motion at 5. BSF acknouledged that that it represents\nalleged victim 2 and potential trial witnesses Virginia Giuffre and Maria Farmer. /d. at l,5.

Maxwell,” the\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law enforcement entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her pre-trial motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6. The peculiar failure of the government to produce these items\nin connection with the “entire” BSF file has yet to be explained. Clearly, BSF knew what the\nterms meant when it used them to block the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of this information in the civil litigation\nand it should not be alloued to profess confusion or ignorance here.\n\nThe cases cited by BSF are not helpful to its cause. For example, the court in United\nStates v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o),\nquashed the subpoena because it did “not satisfy the initial requirement of relevance.” In United\nStates v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), the defendant requested\n“any and all writings and records” related to the NYPD's contact with a particular confidential\nwitness who, according to the defendant, provided relevant information. The subpoena was\nunlimited in time or scope and, to the extent a time or scope were determined, <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the\ninformation was limited by l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. Jd. at 5l3.\n\nUnited States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4 CR l86 SCR, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2oo8), involved a subpoena served by the Defendant on the Metropolitan Detention\n? Judge McMahon described the subpoena as a “general subpoena...I mean, everything that’s in\nBoies Schiller’s files, other than privileged documents, which of course you don’t exclude from\nyour subpoena.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3975", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

[the]inmate at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center Brooklyn from about April 2oo6 to the Present.” Of course, the court found the\nsubpoena did not call for relevant evidence and was also deficient under all three Nixon prongs.\nId. at 5.\n\nNor does this Court’s decision in United States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL\n8735699, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6), help BSF. There, Mr. Pena requested that this Court\nissue five subpoenas to the MDC, MCC, and the DOC seeking records relating to two\ncooperating witnesses expected to testify at trial. Those subpoenas lacked any specificity and\nwere for:\n\nAny and all records relating to inmate [cooperator name], including but not limited\n\nto: (a) name and address of all [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] locations in which\n\n[cooperator name] was housed, the dates when [cooperator name] was housed in\n\nsuch facilities, and all records relating to the transfer of [cooperator name] between\n\nand among [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] facilities; (b) all records of phone calls made\n\nto and from [cooperator name] from [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] custody, including\n\nbut not limited to: call logs and audio recordings; and (c) all Corrlinks emails sent\n\nto and from [cooperator name’s] account.\n\nAs this Court correctly pointed out, the subpoenas were unlimited in time or scope and\ncalled for the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of either inadmissible hearsay or privileged information. /d. at *2.\nAdditionally, this Court observed in Pena, at *3, as applicable here, that:\n\n[T]he Court trusts that the Government is aware of its obligations under Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963), Giglio v.

The subpoena is admissible either as part of the writen motion practice or in a\nhearing on the motions to suppress. Indeed, the Court could take judicial notice of the document\nwhich is in the SDNY court files. Ms. Maxwell would then be the only party to the motion\npractice that was in the dark about the content of the subpoena. What the subpoena commands,\nwhen it was served, and who accepted service are all relevant to the issues before the Court.\nBSF’s only retort is that Ms. Maxwell should get the subpoena from the government. Ms.\nMaxwell asked the government for the subpoena and the government refused this request. She\nhas no other recourse but to ask this Court for assistance.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3979", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page9ofl4\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

A subpoena issued\npursuant to Rule l7(c)(l) “may order the witness to produce designated ‘books, papers,\ndocuments, data, or other objects’” so long as they are “evidentiary.” Bouman Dairy Co. v.\nUnited States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 2l9 (l95l). Rule l7(c)(l) further provides that “[t]he court may\ndirect the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be\noffered in evidence.” When the items arrive, the court may permit the parties and their atorneys\nto inspect all or part of them. Jd.\n\nThe Rule operates to “expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for\nthe inspection of subpoenaed materials,” rather than “provide a means of discovery for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698-99 (l974) (citing Bouman Dairy, 34l US. at\n22o)) (emphasis added). Here, Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena strictly adheres to that which Rule l7\nallous: <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of admitedly relevant and admissible items of evidence in advance of trial.\nItem 9, the journal, purports to be an account of alleged victim 2’s interactions with Epstein that\nform the basis of multiple counts in the indictment. It is exculpatory because the journal contains\nno reference to Ms. Maxwell. Partial pages of the journal were produced in civil litigation\nagainst Epstein, not to help Ms. Maxwell. Inspection of the entire journal is necessary to\nestablish whether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoliation has\noccurred. This examination requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner and\ncannot be performed in the middle of trial without a significant disruption in the proceedings.\nGiven that alleged victim 2 placed the document in issue when she was trying to collect money\nfrom Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, BSF’s argument that the journal is irrelevant or inadmissible is\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo398o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page l3 of l4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The\ngovernment knous that it “is under no obligation to turn over that which it does not have,”\nUnited States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 727, 746 (E.D.N.Y. l994), which is why it refuses to obtain\nthe material. Once again, Ms. Maxwell needs the Court’s assistance.\n\nInformation is “exculpatory and thus ‘favorable’ to the defense for Brady purposes when\nit directly contradicts the motive theory testified to by prosecution witnesses. Mendez v. Artuz,\n3o3 F.3d 4ll, 4l4 (2d Cir. 2oo2). For the reasons articulated in Ms. Maxwell’s ex parte\nsubmission, the EVCP Materials directly contradict the “motive theory” that will be advanced by\nthe prosecution at trial — that Ms. Maxwell was the procurer of underaged women for Epstein.\n\nIn addition, even if the materials were deemed “impeachment only” they would remain\ndiscoverable by a subpoena as exculpatory evidence. Where, as here, the government’s proof\ndepends almost entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the accusers, “impeachment”\nevidence is material and discoverable in advance of trial. As discussed in Poventud v. City of\nNew York, No. o7 CIV. 3998 DAB, 2ol5 WL lo62l86, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

The conspiracy\nwas expanded from four years (without any specific actual dates within that range) to eleven\nyears (again, without any specificity), an additional seven years, and two new counts were added.\nThese were significant and substantial changes that require a continuance. The need to research\nMs. Maxwell’s whereabouts during a full eleven year period, not to mention comb the millions\nof pages of discovery including travel records, phone records, bank records, photographs, diaries,\nmessage pads, credit card records, and countless other records for the eleven-year versus four\nyear period, will take hundreds, if not thousands, of atorney and staff hours.\n\nC.

See United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698-99\n(l974) (citing Bouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l)).

In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo.

While ordinarily Rule l7(c) is “trial-focused”\nand “may be used only to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial,” at least some courts\nhave held that Rule l7(c) can be used to compel the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents in connection with\na suppression hearing. United States v. Louis, No. o4-CR-2o3 (LTS), 2oo5 WL l8o885, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2oo5). Even then, the requests fail for the reasons stated belou.\n\nRequests l through 5 all fail on the basis that they do not comply with Nixon’s specificity\nrequirement. Requests l through 5 all target communications between “any” ouner,\nshareholder, partner or employee of BSF and government officials or co-counsel in civil\nlitigation, from 2ol5 to the date of the subpoena. While the requests focus on a certain subject,\nthe requests are so overbroad that issuance of the Rule l7(c) subpoena would be improper. As\nset forth in the subpoena, the term “communications” encompasses “all forms of correspondence,\nincluding regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or other writen communication of\ninformation of any kind.” The use of the terms “all” and “any” “do not evince specificity.”\nUnited States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472 (PAC), 2o2l WL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6,\n2o2l). Here, the requests do not identify specific lawyers or employees of BSF whose\ncommunications are relevant. See United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol7) (discussing that while an originally requested subpoena was insufficiently specific, a new\nrequested subpoena satisfied the specificity requirement because it identified a specified set of\nindividuals whose records were sought). The requests also encompass “all” forms of\ncorrespondence without limitation. And while the requested subpoenas are limited to the period\nbetween 2ol5 and 2o2l, the timeframe is still overly broad. These requests are precisely the\nkind of “fishing expedition” that the specificity requirement is designed to prevent. See Bouman\nDairy Co., 34l U.S. at 22l. Indeed, the requests are akin to discovery requests in civil litigation.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004043.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page5of9\ndocuments are necessary for purposes of impeachment. But as a general mater, the need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. Many courts have held that impeachment material does not\nbecome relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No. l5-CR-3l7\n(KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8), ), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir.\n2o2l) (collecting cases); United States v. Scaduto, No. 94-CR-3ll (WK), l995 WL l3o5ll, at\n*l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, l995) (“Potentially impeaching statements ‘ripen into evidentiary\nmaterial .. . only if and when the witness testifies at trial... .” (citation omited)). See also\nAvenati, 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (rejecting the argument that the defendant needed the recordings\nin question prior to trial in order “to demonstrate witnesses’ bias or self-interest.”). The\narguments as to relevance are otherwise specious, and the Court cannot discern what relevance\nthe materials responsive to Requests 6 and 7 may have. In any event, there is litle risk that\nreview of these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial,\ngiven their limited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467, 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). For documents that may ripen into relevance if and when the BSF\nclients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the engagement leters to the Court so that the information can be made available\nto Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness’s direct testimony. See United\nStates v. Giampa, No. S 92-CR-437 (PKL), l992 WL 29644o, at *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, l992);\nUnited States v. Ferguson, No. 3:o6-CR-l37 (CFD), 2oo7 WL 45773o3, at *3 (D. Conn.

Other than through\nconclusory speculation, she fails to explain hou the contents of those leters may be relevant to\nher theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the\nextent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce\nthem in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is litle more than an atempt to\ncircumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Giglio material has not\nyet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents\nconsistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion &\nOrder resolving some of Maxwell’s pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good\nfaith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to\ncomply with them. This Court knous well that the Government has not always lived up to those\nobligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good\nfaith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum,\nnone of Maxwell’s theories justify <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of these documents under the Rule l7(c) process.\n\nRequest l2, which seeks “‘any” submission to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation\nProgram made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks\n“any” submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell\noffered to narrou this request to just those materials submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action.\n\nThe request’s failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of\nspecificity, for even if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence captured by this\nrequest, she plainly has not demonstrated the relevance of all materials submited to the EVCP.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page7of9\nSee United States v. Aguilar, No. CR o7-ooo3o (SBA), 2oo8 WL 3l82o29, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug.\n4, 2oo8). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary\nincentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are\nbeing sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be\nimpeachment evidence does not render them “relevant” for purposes of Rule l7(c); if at all, those\ndocuments would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538,\nat *2. Maxwell’s argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is\nexculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or\nwhen those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are\nexculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for\npurposes of cross-examination, leaving litle doubt as to the purported claim of relevance. And\nto the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be\nexculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why\nthat expectation might be reasonable. The “mere hope” that the documents may contain some\nexculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify enforcement of a Rule l7(c) subpoena (or, as here,\nissuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-\n579 (SWK), l984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell’s reliance on cases\ninvolving the Government’s obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment\nevidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context. Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2-\n3. Maxwell thus fails to establish Request l2’s compliance with the Nixon standards. Maxwell\nmay renew her request for these documents once she identifies specific individuals whose\nsubmissions she seeks and spells out with specificity the relevance of all requested materials. At\nthat time, the Court will determine whether it is proper to require <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of these materials to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page8of9\nthe Court so that the information may be made available to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the\nconclusion of each witness’s direct testimony.

Maxwell may\nrenew more tailored requests in compliance with this Order. The Court sees no basis for doing\nso on an ex parte basis. For Requests 9 through ll, the Court will reserve its decision until it\nhears from the Government.\n\nB. The Government’s Subpoena-Related Request\n\nThe Government seeks a preemptive, blanket ruling that it be entitled notice of all future\nsubpoenas, an opportunity to challenge them, and <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of any information obtained\ntherefrom. This request is denied. Assuming Maxwell seeks the issuance of a future subpoena\nfor which there is no basis to proceed ex parte, the Government will be provided notice and the\nCourt would likely consider the Government’s briefing regardless of standing as part of its duty\nto ensure that the subpoena meets the requirements of Nixon. See United States v. Bergstein, No.\nl6-CR-746 (PKC), 2ol7 WL 6887596, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2ol7). But ex parte Rule l7(c)\nsubpoenas are possible in some circumstances if justified.

R. Crim. P. 5(f); United States v.

Evidence may, or may not, be necessary after the government\nconcludes its case-in-chief. Ms. Maxwell’s proposal is reasonable and will avoid any\nunnecessary trial delays because it is unlikely that any Rule 26.2 statements not already in the\npossession of the government, if they exist, will be voluminous or complicated.\n\nGovernment’s Position\n\nConsistent with the position set forth in its April 2l, 2o2l leter to the Court, the\nGovernment proposes that defense counsel provide a proposed witness list and witness\nstatements pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.l four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch a <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> schedule would be consistent with the Government's agreement to provide\nJencks Act material seven weeks in advance of trial, which is significantly before the\nGovernment is obligated to produce such material under the relevant statute. <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> in\nadvance of trial will also ensure adequate time for the Government to file any relevant motions\nand to prepare any rebutal case as appropriate.

Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, lo9 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (quoting Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo),\nabrogated on other grounds as recognized by United States v. Chambers, 75l F. App’x 44, 46 &\nn.l (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order). It is not sufficient for a party to shou only that the subpoenaed\ndocuments “are potentially relevant or admissible.” United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237,\n254 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (internal quotation marks omited). Moreover, as the Court has explained,\nimpeachment material is not “relevant” within the meaning of Nixon “until after the witness\ntestifies.” (Order at 5). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol (“[g]enerally, the need for evidence to impeach\nwitnesses is insufficient to require its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in advance of trial” (citations omited)). Finally,\nRule l7 by its terms prohibits subpoenas aimed at statements “of a witness or a prospective\nwitness.” See Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nAlthough the Government has not seen the proposed subpoena, the Government\nunderstands that Request 9 seeks the complete diary of Minor Victim-2, Request lo seeks a pair\nof boots given to Minor Victim-2, and Request ll seeks a series of photographs. Requests 9 and\nll should be denied. The Government is working to moot Request lo, so the Court should reserve\ndecision on that request until it can be denied as moot.\n\nA. Request 9\n\nThe Government understands that Request 9 calls for Minor Victim-2’s entire diary from\n\nher teenage years. This request is improper under Rule l7 in three respects.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page6eof9\nPage 6\n\nSecond, the request in insufficiently specific. To satisfy the specificity prong, a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena must be able to “reasonably specify the information contained or believed to be\ncontained in the documents sought rather than merely hop[e] that something useful will turn up.”\nBarnes, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *4 (alteration and internal quotation marks omited); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Avenati, No. l9 Cr. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 5o8682, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3l, 2o2o).\nThe defendant’s request for the entire diary is likely to sweep in a significant period of Minor\nVictim-2’s life before Minor Victim-2 met Epstein or the defendant—all of which is irrelevant.\n\nTo justify this overbreadth, the defendant identifies two reasons she needs to review the\ndiary in full: to demonstrate the absence of references to the defendant, and to establish the diary’s\nauthenticity. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). As to the former, there is no probative\nvalue in shouing that diary entries before the defendant had ever met Epstein or the defendant\ncontain no references to Epstein or the defendant, and in any event, the Government has conceded\nthe point. As to the later, the defendant offers only the conclusory statement that review of the\nentire diary is necessary. That is insufficient, as explained above.\n\nThird, the request is barred by Rule l7(h). That section prohibits the use of Rule l7 to\n“subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness,” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h), explaining\nthat such issues are governed by Rule 26.2. The diary is a set of recorded statements by Minor\nVictim-2. To the extent it should be produced, that <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is governed by Rule l6, Rule 26.2,\nBrady, and Giglio, but not Rule l7. See, e.g., United States v. Carton, l7 Cr. 68o (CM), 2ol8 WL\n58l8lo7, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8) (rejecting a request for a personnel file because the\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5 (“The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal for impeachment\npurposes, as highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action Ms. Farmer filed\nagainst the Defendant.”)). But as the Court has recently explained, Rule l7 is not a tool to obtain\nimpeachment material in advance of trial.

A bill of particulars is therefore necessary to\nprevent unfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nIt is also critical that Ms. Maxwell receive accelerated disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list, Jencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-\nconspirator statements. The government predictably argues that there is nothing unusual about\nthe circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a deviation from customary\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique circumstances that warrant the relief she seeks. The Indictment alleges\nvague conduct that is over 25 years old and involves conduct that allegedly took place over a\nfour-year period in multiple locations across the country and in at least one foreign jurisdiction.\nAny relevant documents that may still exist will take time to retrieve. The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and inspection of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the discovery. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73). Because the Court granted Ms. Maxwell’s request to extend the filing\ndeadline for the reply motions by lo days from March 5, 2o2l to March l5, 2o2l, we have moved forward our\nrequested deadline for the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of witness materials by lo days to March 22, 2o2l.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nFinally, the government’s offer to provide Jencks Act and Giglio information for its\ntestifying witnesses “as much as four weeks” before trial is insufficient. (Opp. l84). Certain of\nthe Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made\nnumerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to\nthe media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any\nprior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s\nnumerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.\nMaxwell’s preparation for trial.°\n\nThe Court has already acknouledged that the defense will need substantial time to\nevaluate and investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the\ngovernment, over its objection, to produce certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses by March l2, 2o2l—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73). For the reasons set forth above, the Court should order\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of all of the requested materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nWil. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> and Inspection of\n\nDocuments.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening brief identified several redacted or incomplete documents that\nwere produced in discovery, and documents that were omited from discovery, that are subject to\ndisclosure pursuant to the government’s Brady obligations. (Dkt. l48 at 7-lo). The government\nrepresents that it has reviewed the documents and they do not contain any Brady material apart\nfrom one statement that the government nou discloses in its opposition, or that it is under no\n> The government has offered to provide any co-conspirator statements it intends to introduce at trial at the same\ntime that it provides its Jencks Act disclosures. (Opp. l92). The defense requests that these statements be provided\non the same accelerated timeline set forth above to provide sufficient time in the event that a pretrial hearing is\nnecessary to determine their admissibility.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagel5ofl6\ndefense because it is in the possession of a third party. (Opp. l87-88). Ms. Maxwell anticipates\nthat the rest of the diary will contain exculpatory information and inconsistent statements. It is\ntherefore critical that Ms. Maxwell be able to review the original diary and to test it to ensure it is\nauthentic and writen contemporaneously with the events it describes. If the government will not\nobtain the diary, the Court should order the government to disclose the author’s identity so that\nMs. Maxwell can seek an appropriate subpoena. *\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court grant the motions\npresented in their entirety.\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Christian R.

Ms. Maxwell respectfully disagrees, for\nthe follouing reasons:\nExhibit A, a journal entry, was produced to Ms. Maxwell by Accuser-2 in civil discovery.\nThe document <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> was not subject to any protective order and this exhibit was not\nproduced to Ms. Maxwell by the government. As detailed in Ms. Maxwell’s Response to the\nGovernment’s Leters dated May 4, and May 6, 2o2l regarding F.R. Crim. P. l7(c) subpoena,\nAccuser-2 has publicly discussed her journal, generally, and this entry specifically. Exhibit B\nappears to be a different copy of Exhibit A.\nThe government has offered no reason why either Exhibit should remain sealed. The\nExhibits are “judicial documents” presumptively subject to the public access rights under both\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l Filed o5/2l/2l Page3ofl3\nPage 3\n\nto Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) by October ll, 2o2l, or 7 weeks in advance of trial. These\nmaterials will include testifying witness statements, which themselves will also include any co-\nconspirator statements about which witnesses may testify at trial. This deadline, which is far in\nadvance of when such disclosures are ordinarily made in this District, will provide the defense\nwith ample time to review these materials and prepare for trial. The proposed deadline for notice\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) will provide the defense with ample time to review the\ndisclosure and file any appropriate motions.\n\nThe defense has requested that the Government disclose Giglio and Jencks Act material 9\nweeks in advance of trial, arguing that these materials are necessary for the preparation of motions\nin limine. The Government respectfully notes that this proffered reason does not justify even\nearlier disclosure of the material, particularly in light of the routine practice in this District to brief\nmotions in limine well in advance of disclosure of Giglio and Jencks Act material.’ Instead, the\nGovernment is prepared to provide the defense with such material 7 weeks in advance of trial,\nwhich is significantly earlier than in most cases and consistent with the common practice in this\nDistrict—even for trials held during the pandemic—as well as the Court’s April 26, 2o2l Order.’\n' See, e.g., United States v.

Ulbricht, l4 Cr. 68 (three week\ncybercrime and narcotics trial; 35oo material produced one week before trial (more than three\nweeks after motions in limine)).\n> The Government respectfully notes that the law is clear in this Circuit that the Government is\nunder no obligation under the Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C. § 35oo et seq., to produce prior statements of\nits witnesses until after each witness has testified on direct examination. Courts in this Circuit\nhave consistently held that the district courts lack the pouer to mandate early <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks\nmaterial. See, e.g., United States v.

Entry, Oct. lo,\n2ol3) (Government turned over Jencks Act material less than one week before trial of defendant\ncharged with sex trafficking of a minor and possession of child pornography).\n\nThe Government is unaware of any case of comparable complexity and scope in which\nsuch an early deadline has been set for witness-related disclosures, and the defense has cited none.\nIndeed, even in complex white-collar cases in this District that involve far more complicated fact\npaterns than this case, the Government often provides 35oo material two weeks prior to trial, and,\nif the defendants agree to reasonable stipulations, four weeks before trial. See, e.g., United States\nprohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.”); In re\nUnited States, 834 F.2d 283, 287 (2d Cir. l987). The Government recognizes that Giglio v. United\nStates, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972), requires disclosure of any materials that might be used to impeach\nkey witnesses “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity to act upon\nthe information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir. 2oo7). In\nthis District, the time which is considered to allou for effective use of the material is typically\nmeasured in days or, at most, weeks, before trial. See, e.g., United States v. Underwood, No. o4\nCr. 424 (RWS), 2oo5 WL 927ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2l, 2oo5) (Government ordered to produce\nGiglio material two business days before trial); United States v.

No. 66 (S.D.N.Y. July lo, 2ol8) (35oo material one month before securities fraud trial). The\ndefense’s request for yet earlier disclosure is unfounded and reflects a significant—and\nunwarranted—departure from the practices in this District.\n\nConsistent with the Government’s previously stated position (Dkt. No. 2o4 at l92), it is\nentirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of any co-conspirator statements through\nJencks Act materials and marked exhibits. This is because the Government only intends to\nintroduce co-conspirator statements either through the testimony of witnesses, which will be\npreviewed in the Jencks Act material, or in the exhibits, which will be marked before trial. As the\nGovernment has previously noted, the Second Circuit has rejected the notion that non-exculpatory\nco-conspirator statements are discoverable by Rule l6 or by any other means other than the Jencks\nAct. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing\nDistrict Court’s order directing the Government “to produce all oral statements made by the\ndefendants and coconspirators that the Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a\ndefendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol). The cases cited by the defense all involved orders granting\nbills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all alleged coconspirators. They\ndid not involve orders directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the Government\nmay introduce at trial. Indeed, the Government is unaware of any case in which such particularized\nnotice distinct from the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks Act and marked exhibits has been ordered, and the\ndefense cites none. This Court has already denied the defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars\nfor Counts One through Four (see Dkt. No. 2o7 at l9), and the Government has separately\nsubmited its opposition to the defendant’s supplemental motion for a bill of particulars.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4255", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6 of 349\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 74 of 349\nequipment.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 96 of 349\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4393", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o4 of 349\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o5 of 349\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers.7”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 266 of 349\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4563", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 288 of 349\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l4 of 349\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 26\nGiven the information the defendant already has from the Indictment and discovery, any additional\ndetail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. The discovery gives the defense\nample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to\nunderstand who Minor Victim-4 is from the productions, (see, e.g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),\nthere is no real concern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before\nreceiving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on a\nsimilar issue in this case, the motion for a bill of particulars should be denied.\n\nVII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,\nWhich Do Not Warrant Immediate Disclosure\n\nThe defendant moves for the immediate disclosure of any prior inconsistent statement\nmade by Minor Victim-4. In other words, the defense seeks immediate <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of impeachment\nmaterial for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has already noted in prior\nbriefing, it is aware of its disclosure obligations and intends to produce Giglio material for all of\nits witnesses, including Minor Victim-4, at least six weeks in advance of trial. Consistent with the\npractice in this District, the Court has previously concluded that such time is sufficient for the\ndefense to prepare for trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 3o).\n\nThe Government agrees that any prior statement in which Minor Victim-4 discussed her\ninteractions with Epstein, but omited mention of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense\nin advance of trial. Contrary to the defense’s assertion, houever, such prior statements are classic\nimpeachment material that need only be produced sufficiently in advance of trial to permit the\ndefense adequate time to make use of them. See United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44, l46\n7 Although Minor Victim-4’s identity is clear from the discovery, and the defendant’s motion\nmakes clear that she strongly suspects Minor Victim-4’s identity, there is no basis at this time to\nrequire the Government to turn over the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in\nadvance of its Jencks Act <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, which is customary in this District.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo473l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 26\n\n(2d Cir. 2ool) (prosecution must produce Giglio material “in time for its effective use at trial”).\nImpeachment material simply does not warrant immediate disclosure. See, e.g., United States v.\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 7ol (l974) (“Generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is\ninsufficient to require its <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in advance of trial.”); United States v. Campo Flores, No. l5\nCr. 765 (PAC), 2ol6 WL 5946472, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l2, 2ol6) (“The Government has\nrepresented that it will make impeachment material relating to its anticipated witnesses available\n... ten days before trial. There is no need to depart from the customary rule in this district of\ndisclosure shortly before trial.”).\n\nAlthough not essential to the timing analysis here, the Government notes that the defense\nmotion overstates the significance of the particular statements Minor Victim-4 made during the\nUSAO-SDFL’s investigation. The Government understands from its more recent interviews with\nMinor Victim-4, the notes of which the Government will produce to the defense as part of Minor\nVictim-4’s Giglio and Jencks Act material, that she was not asked any questions about the\ndefendant during her only interview in connection with the USAO-SDFL’s investigation, which\nfocused instead on Epstein and another of Epstein’s employees. Notably, though, when Minor\nVictim-4 was deposed in connection with a civil lawsuit after she was interviewed during the\nUSAO-SDFL’s investigation but more than a decade before the defendant was indicted in this\ncase, Minor Victim-4 affirmatively stated that the defendant was one of the individuals who\nscheduled her massage appointments with Epstein. Minor Victim-4 was not asked any follou-up\nquestions about the defendant during that deposition, but her prior consistent statement regarding\nthe defendant’s involvement in scheduling her massages severely undercuts the defense’s\nsuggestion that Minor Victim-4 entirely fabricated the defendant’s role in Epstein’s scheme after\nthe defendant was indicted in 2o2o. The Government fully intends to provide the defense with all\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4732", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 Filed o6/o4/2l Pagelof6\n[uUspcspNy\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #:\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED:_6/4/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Court\nrequested the Government’s views as to three of those requests: Request 9, which sought\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Minor Victim-2’s entire diary from her teenage years; Request lo, which targeted\na pair of boots that Minor Victim-2 allegedly received as a gift from Jeffrey Epstein and\nMaxwell; and Request ll, which sought original versions of certain photographs. /d. The\nGovernment submited its views on May 4, 2o2l. Dkt. No. 269. It supplemented its leter on\nMay 6, 2o2l. Dkt. No. 27l. The Defendant filed a response on May l2, 2o2l. Having\nconsidered the parties’ views, the Defendant’s request is denied in full.\n\nAs noted, Request 9 seeks the original copy of a journal from an alleged victim from\nwhen she was a teenager. Maxwell received copies of some of the pages in the journal from the\nGovernment pursuant to Rule l6, but the Government represents that it does not have access to\nthe entire journal. In those pages, Minor Victim-2 describes a trip to New York in which she\nspent time with Epstein and, among other things, visited his residence. Minor Victim-2 also\ndescribes her impression of Epstein at the time. There is no indication that Maxwell is\nmentioned there or anywhere else in the journal.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4737", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 _ Filed o6/o4/2l Page3of6\nrepresented that it understands that Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in the diary shortly after\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein and that the diary, as a result, has no entries relating to any later trips she\ntook with Epstein. Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87. Maxwell does not provide any nonconclusory basis to\ndoubt these representations. So while it is undisputed that Maxwell is not referenced in the\ndiary—BSF, the Government, and Maxwell all agree on this point—the absence of references\nalone, without regard to whether the diary contains entries relevant to the incidents about which\nMinor Victim-2 is expected to testify at trial, does not establish any relevance except as to\npotential impeachment.\n\nNor do any of Maxwell’s additional arguments establish the relevance of the rest of the\njournal. She points to the fairness doctrine and Rules lo6 and Rule 6l2 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence as providing additional bases for the propriety of the request under Rule l7(c). She\ncites cases regarding the fairness doctrine in the context of atorney-client privilege that have no\napplication to the issue presently before the Court. Furthermore, to the extent she makes an\nargument under Rule lo6 or Rule 6l2, the argument is premature. Even assuming that Rule lo6\nand Rule 6l2 could provide grounds for admissibility and relevance at trial, that would only\nripen at trial if portions of the journal are introduced and admited. Her Rule 6l2 argument is\nfurther strained by the fact that, even if that rule applied, it would not entitle the Defendant to\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the entire journal. The Rule provides that “[i]f the producing party claims that the\nwriting includes unrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.” Fed. R. Evid.\n6l2(b). Here, both the Government and BSF, on behalf of Minor Victim-2, have asserted that\nthe rest of the journal is unrelated. In any event, none of these principles establish the relevance\nof the journal beyond impeachment, and all of the arguments presented to the contrary are\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4739", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 Filed o6/o4/2l Page4of6\nmeritless. Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The difference, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing\nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a\nphotograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of\nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here\nagain Maxwell’s arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony. For\nall of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper\nvehicle for Request 9.\n\nRequest lo seeks <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein\nallegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that\nBSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the\nGovernment will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial.\nMaxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots’ <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to the defense.\nThe argument is meritless. Rule l7(c) is not the proper mechanism for discovery from third\nparties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial.”\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo.

Maxwell seeks these materials to inspect them prior to trial in order to investigate their\nauthenticity. In its May 6 leter, the Government indicated that the original versions of a subset\nof the photographs are in the FBI’s possession, and the Government will make those photographs\navailable to the defense for inspection upon request. The Court agrees with the Government that\nthe request is moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent that the Government fails to\ncomply with its representation that it will make those photographs available to the defense upon\nrequest, the defense may make an application to the Court.\n\nAs to the remaining photographs, the request is denied on the basis that the defense has\nfailed to establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already\nhas photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers\nthat it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are\ngenuine. The only discernible theory of relevance as to this request is impeachment. Maxwell\ndoes not set forth any other nonconclusory basis for their relevance. And again, because\nimpeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule l7(c), the request fails to meet Nixon’s\nrelevance requirement. But even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish\nrelevance, the argument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s\ntestimony or whether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nI.

(l8-2868, Dkt. |\nNo. l38.) The docket reveals that responsive filings were in fact delivered to the Court of |\nAppeals; no further order has been entered in the Second Circuit. |\nThe consolidated appeal relates only to the unsealing of what would, but for the |\nProtective Order and Judge Sweet’s repeated decisions to permit materials to be filed under seal |\nand his refusal to unseal those materials on the motions of the Intervenors, be publicly available |\nin the files of the court.

The Government’s Application :\nIn late November or early December 2ol8, the Government commenced an investigation |\ninto Epstein and others for unlawfully trafficking minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, |\nl594(c) and unlawfully enticing minors in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b). (Sealed Aff. and |\nAppl. of AUSA Alex Rossmiller dated Feb. 5, 2ol9 (““Gov’t Appl.”), Dkt. No. l, § 3.) ;\nAs part of that investigation, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller\n“requiring the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of copies of discovery and related materials in [the Giuffre Action].” |\n(Gov’t Appl., J 5.) These materials are arguably subject to the Protective Order. |\nOn February 5, 2ol9, the Government made an ex parte, in camera application to Judge |\nSweet under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § l65l(a), seeking to relieve Boies Schiller from the |\nProtective Order so that it could respond to the subpoena. The Government represented in that |\napplication that Boies Schiller was willing to comply with the subpoena but for the Protective :\nSDNY_GM_ooooo879 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4929 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the Protective Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\ndestruction of documents upon conclusion of the case (see Protective Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the Protective Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 27\nTo Be Filed Under Seal\n\nof turning over their discovery to the government in order to coerce a setlement”). The parties\nalso setled just a short time before trial; such a setlement could have been occasioned, at least in )\npart, to avoid the public disclosure of any confidential materials. |\nHouever, the only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied |\nis that Giuffre or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, |\nforward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an |\ninvestigation. But I am not faced with that situation. Nothing in this record suggests to me that :\nGiuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |\njury to look into the maters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the |\nGovernment has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |\nthat it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |\nexistence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |\nmoment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |\nMoreover, the Assistant United States Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |\nwhat is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood |\non his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. |\nThe literal terms of the Protective Order permit the court to authorize the release of |\n:\nConfidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shoun.” (Protective Order, {[ l4.) :\nAny party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |\nMaterials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |\nduly empouered grand jury seeks their <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo895 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4945 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 27\n, To Be Filed Under Seal\nto use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal investigation or grand jury\n\nproceeding. See also Botha y. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97-cv-7587, l998 WL 88745, at\n*3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb, 27, l998) (“[I]he Government may not use its ‘awesome’ investigative |\npouers to seek modification of a protective order merely to compare the fruits of . . . discovery |\nin a civil action with the results of a prosecutorial investigation in a cdinaital action.”). |\nAdditionally, the Government is not on a fishing expedition, merely hoping to inspect the |\nprotected materials for possible use in a future criminal investigation. In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal. Cf Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, |\nl99l, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the bankruptcy examination, which |\nincluded deposition excerpts, “was made available to the public”).

NATHAN, District Judge:\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing four subpoenas pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, she seeks authorization\nto serve subpoenas on four individuals. For the reasons that follou, the Court DENIES\nMaxwell’s motion without prejudice.\nl. Legal Standard\nRule l7(c) permits subpoenas ordering the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of “books, papers, documents,\ndata, or other objects.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(l). When the subpoena seeks the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim, it may be served on a third party only by\ncourt order. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nThe purpose of Rule l7(c) is to facilitate the trial by designating a time and place prior to\ntrial to obtain and inspect evidentiary material. See United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698—\n99 (l974) (citing Bouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l)).

Asa result, courts must be mindful not to allou the Rule l7(c)\nprocess to become a “broad discovery device” that would undermine the discovery procedures\nset forth in Rule l6. United States v.

United States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4-CR-l86 (SCR), 2oo8 WL\n9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2oo8).\n\nTo determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the\nfactors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo. To clear that hurdle,\nthe Court considers (l) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. /d. at 7oo.\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nOn April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l, the Court denied Maxwell’s request for an order\nauthorizing issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Boies, Schiller, Flexner LLP. See Dkt. Nos.\n252, 298. In doing so, the Court noted that the requests contained in that proposed subpoena all\nfailed the Nixon test. The proposed subpoenas to these four individuals seek similar materials,\nand the subpoenas fail for similar reasons.\n\nA. Subpoena Recipient-l\n\nThe Court begins with the proposed subpoenas to Subpoena Recipient-l. The proposed\nsubpoena to her makes five requests which overlap entirely with requests contained in the\nproposed subpoena to BSF. Specifically, Maxwell requests (l) any contingent fee and\nengagement agreements between Subpoena Recipient-land any atorneys; (2) Subpoena\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005032.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page3oflo\nRecipient-l’s original journal for inspection and copying; (3) a pair of black boots that Maxwell\nand Jeffrey Epstein allegedly gave to Subpoena Recipient-l; (4) <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the original copies\nof certain photographs of Subpoena Recipient-l; and (5) materials related to the Epstein Victim\nCompensation Fund. As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.\n\nThe request for any contingent or engagement agreements fails because Maxwell has not\nmade the required shouing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only\nplausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary\nfor purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 4-5. The need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment\nmaterial does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.\nl5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of relevance to these\nmaterials—and Maxwell does not advance any explanation, other than impeachment, as to why\nthese materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any relevance or admissibility,\nthe request is improper for purposes of Rule l7(c). In any event, there is litle risk that review of\nthese materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their\nlimited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467 (ALC), 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). Ifthe materials become relevant at trial, Maxwell will be able to\nprocure them at that time.\n\nMaxwell’s request for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Subpoena Recipient-l’s journal also fails the Nixon\ntest. As the Court noted in its June 2, 2o2l opinion, the original and complete journal is not the\nproper subject of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. As already noted, mere impeachment purposes do not\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o32", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page4oflo\nwarrant the issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at l-2.\nMaxwell’s other theories of relevance similarly fail; as the Court previously observed, there is no\nmerit to Maxwell’s contention that the contents of the journal, other than the pages to which she\nalready has access, are exculpatory. See id. And more generally, the request for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\nthe entire original journal is speculative and overbroad, amounting to litle more than a “fishing\nexpedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7o.\n\nThe request for the original pair of black boots is moot. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l\nOrder, at 4-5. The Government has indicated that it has requested that BSF produce the boots to\nthe FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the Government will promptly\nmake them available to the defense for examination and use at trial. Rule l7(c) is not the proper\nmechanism for discovery from third parties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable\nreasonably in advance of trial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo. That is the case here: The\nGovernment has represented that the defense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. See\nDkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5.\n\nThe request for original copies of certain photographs similarly fails. As the Court\npreviously noted, the defense has access to photocopies of those photographs; the request is\ntherefore for the originals. The Government has indicated that a subset of those photographs are\nin the FBI’s possession and that it will make them available to the defense for inspection; the\nrequest is moot as to those photographs. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5. And as\nto the remaining photographs, the request is again denied on the basis that the defense has failed\nto establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already has\nphotocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. The only discernible theory of\nrelevance as to the original versions of these photographs is impeachment. Once again, it is\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o33", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page6oflo\n\nB. Subpoena Recipient-2\n\nThe proposed subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-2 contains four requests. The first seeks\nany contingent fee and engagement agreements between Subpoena Recipient-2 and any\natorneys; the second seeks an envelope that allegedly has Epstein’s and Maxwell’s “touch\nDNA”; the third seeks certain physical evidence, including photographs, old diaries, and\ntelephone books; and the fourth seeks EVCP materials. The first and fourth requests fail for the\nsame reasons as discussed above; their only plausible theory of relevance is impeachment, which\nplaces them outside the proper scope of Rule l7(c).\n\nThe second and third requests are plainly sought for impeachment purposes. Indeed,\nMaxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the envelope in order to “disprove”\nclaims that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial if called to testify. Beyond a conclusory\nassertion regarding Subpoena Recipient-2, houever, Maxwell does not make any effort to\nidentify which claims she seeks to disprove. Nor does she explain why the envelope, or any\ninformation derived from its inspection, is relevant to the criminal charges she is facing. At\nmost, that is, she seeks the envelope in order to impeach any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-\n2 might have if called to testify. The request is speculative and clearly beyond the proper scope\nof Rule l7(c).\n\nThe third request, for vast amounts of physical evidence that Subpoena Recipient-2\nshoued or produced to Subpoena Recipient-3, fails for two reasons. The first is relevance; as\nabove, Maxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks to examine the evidence in order to prepare\nto rebut any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial (or any evidence\nintroduced through Subpoena Recipient-2). Here, too, the request seeks to impeach Subpoena\nRecipient-2’s potential testimony. That is insufficient. Other than that, Maxwell makes no effort\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page3oflo\n\nAs previously detailed, Annie Farmer is believed to be the alleged victim referred to in\nthe superseding indictment as “Minor Victim 2.” She is represented by BSF. See, e.g., Annie\nFarmer v. Indyke, et al., No. l9 Civ. lo475 (LGS). The proposed BSF Subpoena calls for\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of particular physical items that belong to Annie Farmer, specifically a journal, black\nboots, and certain photographs. BSF produced photos of those items (and PDF replications of\nthe photographs) to Ms. Maxwell in the Annie Farmer action. It is unknoun whether the items\nare currently in the possession of BSF or Ms. Annie Farmer. Ms. Maxwell proposes to serve a\nsubpoena, atached as Exhibit l, on Ms. Annie Farmer for the physical items; counsel also\nproposes that service be effected through BSF if they are willing to accept service.' Inspection\nof each of these items in advance of trial is necessary for the reasons set forth in the Ms.\nMaxwell’s First Motion.\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Ms. Annie Farmer in the event that BSF\nclaims the physical items are not in their custody or control, but rather belong to (and are in the\npossession of) their client. The proposed subpoena seeks no new or additional information\nbeyond that which is sought by the BSF Subpoena.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Annie Farmer’s older sister,\nMaria Farmer. See Exhibit 2. Like Annie, Maria Farmer is represented by BSF. See Maria\nFarmer v. Indyke et al., l9 Civ. lo474 (NRB). Ms. Maxwell seeks to serve the proposed\nsubpoena on Maria Farmer through BSF if they are willing to accept service.\n\nDefense counsel does not believe that Maria Farmer is mentioned in the Indictment,\nhouever, counsel believes the government will offer her as a witness at this criminal trial either\n\n' Fed.

Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell seeks <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of these materials in advance of\ntrial. She makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in favor of an ex parte”\nprocess and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and trial strategy to\ndemonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility requirements of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena. United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nIt is well-established that the Court may order that the materials should be produced to\ncounsel’s office, rather than to the courtroom itself. See, e.g., United States v. DNRB, Inc., No.\n4:l5-cr-o362, 2ol7 WL 28o625l, at *3 (W.D. Mo. June 27, 2ol7) (directing <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to\nrequesting party); United States v. Jewell, Crim. No. 4:o7-cr-oolo3, 2oo8 WL 387l736, at *3\n(E.D. Ark. Aug. l5, 2oo8) (directing third-party to produce nonprivileged responsive material to\ndefendant’s counsel). Once delivered to counsel's office, the materials are not automatically\nrequired to be shared with the government. Whether they are required to be shared is determined\nby other applicable rules, e.g., Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b).\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 2 of 6o\nAO 89B (o7/l6) Subpoena to Produce Documents, Information, or Objects in a Criminal Case\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nfor the\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States of America )\n__V. )\na)\nDefendant )\nSUBPOENA TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS, INFORMATION, OR\nOBJECTS IN A CRIMINAL CASE\nTo: Annie Farmer c/o Boies Schiller & Flexner, LLP\n(Name of person to whom this subpoena is directed)\nYOU ARE COMMANDED to produce at the time, date, and place set forth belou the follouing books, papers,\ndocuments, data, or other objects:\nSee Atachment A\nPlace: Jeffrey S.

They compromise her right to prepare her defense and deprive her of her constitutional\nright to effective assistance of counsel.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been in custody for over l5 months without access to the evidence the\nGovernment intends to introduce at trial. The Court established a deadline of October ll for\nthose and other materials to be disclosed. Late in the evening of October ll, the Government\nproduced to counsel approximately l4,ooo! pages of single-spaced witness materials, as well as\nnumerous exhibits and its purported 4o4(b) Notice and Co-Conspirator Notice. But the\nGovernment refused to hand-deliver those materials to MDC as they have with previous\nproductions in this case. Because the MDC will not accept hard drives from defense counsel but\nwill from the Government, counsel provided hard-drives to the Government a week in advance\nof October ll and requested that it hand deliver the hard drive to MDC on October ll, the day of\nCourt-ordered disclosure. The government denied this request, choosing instead to send the hard\ndrive via FedEx.\n\nTracking information confirms that the MDC received the hard drive on October l2. On\nOctober l3, counsel informed the Government that Ms. Maxwell still had not received the hard\ndrive and emailed MDC Legal. Again this morning, counsel emailed MDC Legal regarding the\nfailure to provide Ms. Maxwell with the hard drive containing 35oo material. The MDC has\nfailed to respond. Ms. Maxwell did not receive the hard drive until late this morning.\n\nIt is imperative that the Court intervene. As we approach trial, it is ever more imperative\nthat critical trial documents and Jencks Act and Giglio material be given to Ms. Maxwell\npromptly upon delivery to the institution. Based on the MDC’s inefficiency and mishandling of\nlegal mail, I have no confidence MDC is capable of fulfilling its responsibilities and every reason\n' There appear to be approximately 8,ooo pages of testifying witness materials, and another 6,ooo single-\nspaced pages of newly produced “non-testifying witness” materials, the bulk of which appears\nexculpatory.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo523o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 358 Filed lo/l8/2l Page3of4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Daly, 842 F.2d l38o, l386 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Court may consider the coconspirator statements themselves in determining whether\nthe 8ol(d)(2)(E) prerequisites have been met. Houever, because “these hearsay statements are\npresumptively unreliable,” United States v.

Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse.

The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial.

R. Evid. 8ol).\nAccordingly, the Government argued that “the defense will receive notice of any co-conspirator\nstatements that the Government may seek to introduce through witness statements” in its Jencks\nAct <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4).\n\nThe Court denied the motion, explaining that the Court lacked the pouer to order pretrial\ndisclosure of non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements. (Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7). The\nCourt also explained that the “[c]o-conspirator statements may often be admited at trial on a\nconditional basis,” and to the extent that “can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary\nhere because the Government has commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six\nweeks in advance of trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.” (/d. at 3o-3l).\n\nThe defendant’s second bite at the apple came in the parties’ joint scheduling leter. (Leter,\nDkt. No. 29l). There, the defense requested that the Government “identify any co-conspirator’s\nnames and statements (whether via witness testimony or documentary evidence) at the same time\nas it discloses []35oo material,” so it could “litigate their admissibility before trial.” (/d. at ll-l2).\nThe Government responded that it is “entirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of\nany co-conspirator statements through Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits,” because any co-\nconspirator statements will be contained therein. (/d. at 5). The Government also noted that the\ndefendant cited no cases “directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the\nGovernment may introduce at trial.” (/d.)\n\nOn June 2, 2o2l, the Court adopted the “Government’s proposal” and set a deadline of\nOctober ll, 2o2l, for the “disclosure of Jencks Act and Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence and\n56\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo584o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 58 of 84\nnotice, co-conspirator statements, and Government witness list,” as well as the “Defendant’s\nproposal” that the Government disclose its proposed exhibit list that same day. (Order at l, Dkt.\nNo. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-\nconspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant’s second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the\nGovernment to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed\nrequest for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new\nrequest for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its discovery\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied the\ndefense’s motion, but in a footnote, explained that it “presume[d] the Government intends to\ndisclose” the “identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,” since the Government had not previously opposed that\nrequest. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l). The order said nothing about identifying co-\nconspirator’s statements. (/d.).\n\nThe Government filed a leter opposing the request for the Government to “identify [the\ndefendant]’s unnamed co-conspirators.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 32o). The defendant filed a new\nleter in response, raising “two issues.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 33l). First, the defendant sought the\nidentities of co-conspirators. (/d. at l-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once\nagain seeking “disclosure of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to\noffer at trial.” (/d. at 3). The defendant also argued that the Court’s scheduling order had already\nrequired the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements. (/d. at 3-4).\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo584l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 59 of 84\n\nOn September 3, 2o2l, the Court ordered the Government to “disclose to the Defendant\nthe identities of all unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment to whom it will refer at\ntrial.” (Order at l, Dkt. No. 335). The Court further ordered the Government to “disclose all co-\nconspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this\nCourt’s scheduling order.” (/d. at 2).\n\nAccordingly, on October ll, 2o2l, the Government produced its exhibit list and Jencks\nAct material to the defendant. The Jencks Act materials and exhibits contained the only co-\nconspirator statements in the Government’s possession that will be offered at trial. It also disclosed\nthe identities of the individuals to whom it may refer at trial as co-conspirators and informed the\ndefendant that it “has produced all co-conspirator statements which it intends to offer at trial ...\nin the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> [that day] or in its previous productions.” (Def. Mot. l Ex. l at\nl). The Government further noted that “[t]o the extent the Government learns of additional co-\nconspirator statements as it continues to prepare for trial, it will produce those statements in\nconnection with its ongoing obligation to produce Jencks Act material.” (/d.).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe Government has complied with its pre-trial disclosure obligations, consistent with the\nCourt’s orders and on a schedule with deadlines well in advance of trial. As of October ll, the\nGovernment produced all co-conspirator statements in its possession that it intends to offer at trial.\nTo the extent that the Government learns of additional co-conspirator statements as it prepares for\ntrial—such as in a session preparing a witness for trial—it will produce those statements as part of\nits ongoing Jencks Act obligations.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5842", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6l of 84\nas the defense might like the Government to create such an index, that is simply not hou the\nlitigation of co-conspirator statements is handled. And it is not what the Court’s order, requiring\n“disclos[ur]e” of co-conspirator statements, required.\n\nThe Government’s obligation is to make disclosures. The Government is not obligated to\nserve as members of the defense team, reviewing Jencks Act materials for the defense and\nitemizing and indexing disclosures for them. The Government is no more obligated to itemize\nJencks Act materials containing co-conspirator statements than it is obligated to exhaustively detail\nfor the defense the basis for offering any other type of witness statement contained in the Jencks\nAct material it has produced. Such an obligation would extremely burdensome and is both without\nprecedent and entirely unnecessary. The defense team has ample resources to review the\nGovernment’s disclosures and file any motions they wish to make regarding the admission of\ncertain testimony. And there is ample time before trial for the defense to do so, and no basis in the\nrecord to believe the defense will be unable to raise these issues and seek a ruling before trial.\n\nThe defense argues that the Court did order the Government to itemize co-conspirator\nstatements contained in its Jencks Act <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. In support, houever, the defense cites to orders\nrelating to the disclosure of the identities of co-conspirators. (Compare Def. Mot. l at 2 (citing\nDkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l) and Def. Mot. l at 3 (citing Dkt. No. 335 at 3) (stating that the Court\nrejected the defendant’s arguments “because of ‘the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator\nissues in advance of trial’” (emphasis in Def. Mot. l)), with Op. & Order at l2 n.l, Dkt. No. 3l7\n(“Additionally, Maxwell includes in her motion for a bill of particulars a request to require the\ngovernment to identify the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5844", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005845.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 62 of 84\ncharged in the S2 indictment.”), and Order at 3, Dkt. No. 335 (follouing the above sentence with\n“Tn light of the interests discussed above . . . the Court will require the Government to disclose the\nidentities of any unnamed co-conspirators... .”).\n\nThe defense also argues that failure to provide an index of co-conspirator statements\npermits “the presentation of false testimony” and is “‘an invitation to manufacture evidence,”\nbecause a witness will offer a co-conspirator statement for the first time. (Def. Mot. l at 4). This\nargument is nonsensical and offensive. It is deeply unfortunate that defense counsel would so\ncasually resort to baseless allegations that the Government would manufacture evidence and\npresent false testimony at trial. And in any event, the Government produced to the defense Jencks\nAct material containing co-conspirator statements in its possession on October ll and will\ncontinue to make Jencks Act productions as it prepares for trial. To the extent the defense is\nconcemed that a witness will say something on the stand for the first time, the Government cannot\ndisclose that in advance because no lawyer can knou a witness’s verbatim answer in advance. But\nwere that to occur, the defense would be well positioned to cross-examine the witness. !°\n'S The defendant’s motion also makes the puzzling argument that co-conspirator statements are\nproblematic in this case because the defense is limited in its ability to call co-conspirators to testify\nas defense witnesses. (Def. Mot. l at 4). That is true in essentially every criminal case, as the\nCourt has previously noted. (See Op. & Order at l7-l8, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“There are also serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”)).\nIn any event, to the extent the defense takes issue with the rule that co-conspirator statements can\nbe admited without requiring the declarant to testify, that complaint is properly directed to the\ndrafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5845", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005846.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 63 of 84\n\nEven if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice\nare exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple electronic\ndevices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def. Mot. l at 3),\nany statements contained in emails or other documents that the Government plans to use at trial\nhave been marked as Government exhibits and produced to the defense. The defense need look\nno further than the Government’s exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.\nSimilarly, although the defense complains of “document dumps” (id. at 2) and the need to review\n“thousands of pages of newly provided discovery material” (id. at 7), any witness testimony\ncontaining co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government’s Jencks Act <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>—\nand specifically, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of material for testifying witnesses. Although the\nGovernment produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the\nGovernment does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the\ndefense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense\nknous exactly which declarants’ statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).!®\n\nFinally, and in any event, suppression is not a proper remedy. The defense relies\nprincipally on Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order\n'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial\nhave other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,\ninstructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions\nsubject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.\n\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5846", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o6 Filed ll/o2/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\ncredibility will be the central question for the jury in this case.” (Dkt. No. 29l at l2). From the\nface of the expert notice, it appears that few if any of the defendant’s eight experts would offer\ntestimony whose relevance only became apparent after the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks\nAct material and its exhibit list, and it is unlikely that these eight experts were all retained in the\nlast two weeks. The Government should not nou be prejudiced by the defendant’s apparent\ngamesmanship in seeking an unnecessarily cramped disclosure schedule. Accordingly, for these\nsix experts, the Government proposes to submit any Daubert briefing on November 23, with\ndefense responses due November 3o.\n\nDefense Position\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court hold the hearing on November lo, 2o2l.\n\nThe Court gave the parties a simple directive which was to confer and pick a date for the\nDaubert and Rule 4l2 hearing, the options being November 5, 9, or lo. Defense counsel atempted\nthis conferral and sent an email to the government stating, in relevant part:\n\n[W]e are free for the Rule 4l2/Daubert hearing on Nov. 9 or lo but have a\npreference for Nov. lo. Please advise what the government’s preference is.\n\nI believe the Court requested that we give our preference about the date of the Rule\n4l2/Daubert hearing in a joint leter to the Court filed on ECF. I think we could\ninclude our positions on the trial length in that leter as well. Please let me knou if\nyou will draft the leter or if you would like the defense to draft it.\n\nThe government’s non-response to this straightforward conferral was: “On the timing\nof the 4l2/Daubert hearing, we’re preparing a draft leter which we’ll send you shortly.”\nInstead of conferring with defense counsel the government at, 7:o7 p.m., sent its two\nsentence non-conferral:\n\nOn the other issue, scheduling the Daubert/4l2 hearing, atached is a draft leter,\nalong with our proposed redactions to your expert notice. Please feel free to insert\nyour position, which we ask that you do by 9:oo.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page7ofll\nPage 7\nshouing.” (/d. at l). The Court also found that “nothing in the record plausibly establishes that\ncurrent protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with\nher lawyers.” (/d. at 2).\n\nThe defendant then filed another motion in the Second Circuit, seeking bail or, in the\nalternative, an evidentiary hearing regarding the conditions of her confinement. (See United States\nv. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 89 (2d Cir. May l7, 2o2l)). In the motion, she renewed her claims\nthat the “horrific conditions [at MDC] make it impossible to prepare for trial.” (/d. at 2; see also\nid. at 2-3 (listing alleged horrific conditions, such as sleep deprivation, broun water, surveillance\nof atorney-client meetings, overflouing sewage, computer without sufficient capacity to review\ndiscovery)). The Second Circuit denied her motion in a writen order. (See United States v.\nMaxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 96 (2d Cir. June 2, 2o2l)).\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nIn seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden of shouing, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of flight, and that no condition or\ncombination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f);\nUnited States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nHouever, where, as here, the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including offenses\ninvolving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, 2422 or 2423, a statutory presumption arises\n“that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the\nperson as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, the defendant “bears a limited\nburden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward\nwith evidence that [s]he does not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\n433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the statutory\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page5ofl2\nit intends to offer at trial ... in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> today or in its previous\nproductions.” And, circumnavigating this Court’s Order with Magellan-like skill, promised that,\nas the government “continues to prepare for trial” it will produce any additional co-conspirator\nstatements “in connection with its ongoing obligation to produce Jencks Act material.” See, Ex.\nl.\nI. The Government Failed to Identify Any Purported Co-Conspirator\n\nStatements\n\nFor a statement to fall within the definition of Fed.R.Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E), “a court must\nfind (l) that there was a conspiracy, (2) that its members included the declarant and the party\nagainst whom the statement is offered, and (3) that the statement was made both (a) during the\ncourse of and (b) in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll96\n(2d Cir. l993). These conditions precedent are “[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the\nadmissibility of evidence” as referenced in Fed. R. Evid. lo4(a), and must be proven by a\npreponderance of the evidence. United States v. Daly, 842 F.2d l38o, l386 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Court may consider the coconspirator statements themselves in determining whether\nthe 8ol(d)(2)(E) prerequisites have been met. Houever, because “these hearsay statements are\npresumptively unreliable,” United States v. Tellier, 83 F.3d 578, 58o (2d Cir. l996), there must\nbe independent corroborating evidence of the existence of the conspiracy and the participation\ntherein of the declarant and the defendant. Jd.\n\nII. Ongoing Document Dumps Containing Thousands of Statements Do Not\n\nSatisfy the Court’s Order to Disclose\n\nThe government neither objected to Ms. Maxwell's request for disclosure nor the Court’s\nOrder requiring disclosure at the same time.

As the Second Circuit has\nexplained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only tend to prove the government’s case, and evidence\nthat adds context and dimension to the government’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.”\nId.; accord United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d l553, l56l (2d Cir. l99l). The Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly held that actions and statements are admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged,\nand are “not considered other crimes evidence under” Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), if (a) they\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are\n“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see also United\nStates v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 9o, 93-94\n(2d Cir. 2oo3).

Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged.

The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions. The\ndefense nou also has this briefing, five weeks before trial. Thus, any alleged gap in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6748", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006765.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5/7 of 84\nGovernment planned to offer at trial as admissions of a defendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol).\nAccordingly, the Government argued that “the defense will receive notice of any co-conspirator\nstatements that the Government may seek to introduce through witness statements” in its Jencks\nAct <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4).\n\nThe Court denied the motion, explaining that the Court lacked the pouer to order pretrial\ndisclosure of non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements. (Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7). The\nCourt also explained that the “[c]o-conspirator statements may often be admited at trial on a\nconditional basis,” and to the extent that “can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary\nhere because the Government has commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six\nweeks in advance of trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.” (/d. at 3o-3l).\n\nThe defendant’s second bite at the apple came in the parties’ joint scheduling leter. (Leter,\nDkt. No. 29l). There, the defense requested that the Government “identify any co-conspirator’s\nnames and statements (whether via witness testimony or documentary evidence) at the same time\nas it discloses []35oo material,” so it could “litigate their admissibility before trial.” (/d. at ll-l2).\nThe Government responded that it is “entirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of\nany co-conspirator statements through Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits,” because any co-\nconspirator statements will be contained therein. (/d. at 5). The Government also noted that the\ndefendant cited no cases “directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the\nGovernment may introduce at trial.” (/d.)\n\nOn June 2, 2o2l, the Court adopted the “Government’s proposal” and set a deadline of\nOctober ll, 2o2l, for the “disclosure of Jencks Act and Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence and\n56\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6765", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006766.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 58 of 84\nnotice, co-conspirator statements, and Government witness list,” as well as the “Defendant’s\nproposal” that the Government disclose its proposed exhibit list that same day. (Order at l, Dkt.\nNo. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-\nconspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant’s second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the\nGovernment to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed\nrequest for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new\nrequest for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its discovery\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied the\ndefense’s motion, but in a footnote, explained that it “presume[d] the Government intends to\ndisclose” the “identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,” since the Government had not previously opposed that\nrequest. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l). The order said nothing about identifying co-\nconspirator’s statements. (/d.).\n\nThe Government filed a leter opposing the request for the Government to “identify [the\ndefendant]’s unnamed co-conspirators.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 32o). The defendant filed a new\nleter in response, raising “two issues.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 33l). First, the defendant sought the\nidentities of co-conspirators. (/d. at l-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once\nagain seeking “disclosure of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to\noffer at trial.” (/d. at 3). The defendant also argued that the Court’s scheduling order had already\nrequired the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements. (/d. at 3-4).\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6766", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006767.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 59 of 84\n\nOn September 3, 2o2l, the Court ordered the Government to “disclose to the Defendant\nthe identities of all unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment to whom it will refer at\ntrial.” (Order at l, Dkt. No. 335). The Court further ordered the Government to “disclose all co-\nconspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this\nCourt’s scheduling order.” (/d. at 2).\n\nAccordingly, on October ll, 2o2l, the Government produced its exhibit list and Jencks\nAct material to the defendant. The Jencks Act materials and exhibits contained the only co-\nconspirator statements in the Government’s possession that will be offered at trial. It also disclosed\nthe identities of the individuals to whom it may refer at trial as co-conspirators and informed the\ndefendant that it “has produced all co-conspirator statements which it intends to offer at trial ...\nin the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> [that day] or in its previous productions.” (Def. Mot. l Ex. l at\nl). The Government further noted that “[t]o the extent the Government learns of additional co-\nconspirator statements as it continues to prepare for trial, it will produce those statements in\nconnection with its ongoing obligation to produce Jencks Act material.” (/d.).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe Government has complied with its pre-trial disclosure obligations, consistent with the\nCourt’s orders and on a schedule with deadlines well in advance of trial. As of October ll, the\nGovernment produced all co-conspirator statements in its possession that it intends to offer at trial.\nTo the extent that the Government learns of additional co-conspirator statements as it prepares for\ntrial—such as in a session preparing a witness for trial—it will produce those statements as part of\nits ongoing Jencks Act obligations.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6767", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6l of 84\nas the defense might like the Government to create such an index, that is simply not hou the\nlitigation of co-conspirator statements is handled. And it is not what the Court’s order, requiring\n“disclos[ur]e” of co-conspirator statements, required.\n\nThe Government’s obligation is to make disclosures. The Government is not obligated to\nserve as members of the defense team, reviewing Jencks Act materials for the defense and\nitemizing and indexing disclosures for them. The Government is no more obligated to itemize\nJencks Act materials containing co-conspirator statements than it is obligated to exhaustively detail\nfor the defense the basis for offering any other type of witness statement contained in the Jencks\nAct material it has produced. Such an obligation would extremely burdensome and is both without\nprecedent and entirely unnecessary. The defense team has ample resources to review the\nGovernment’s disclosures and file any motions they wish to make regarding the admission of\ncertain testimony. And there is ample time before trial for the defense to do so, and no basis in the\nrecord to believe the defense will be unable to raise these issues and seek a ruling before trial.\n\nThe defense argues that the Court did order the Government to itemize co-conspirator\nstatements contained in its Jencks Act <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. In support, houever, the defense cites to orders\nrelating to the disclosure of the identities of co-conspirators. (Compare Def. Mot. l at 2 (citing\nDkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l) and Def. Mot. l at 3 (citing Dkt. No. 335 at 3) (stating that the Court\nrejected the defendant’s arguments “because of ‘the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator\nissues in advance of trial’” (emphasis in Def. Mot. l)), with Op. & Order at l2 n.l, Dkt. No. 3l7\n(“Additionally, Maxwell includes in her motion for a bill of particulars a request to require the\ngovernment to identify the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6769", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 62 of 84\ncharged in the S2 indictment.”), and Order at 3, Dkt. No. 335 (follouing the above sentence with\n“Tn light of the interests discussed above . . . the Court will require the Government to disclose the\nidentities of any unnamed co-conspirators... .”).\n\nThe defense also argues that failure to provide an index of co-conspirator statements\npermits “the presentation of false testimony” and is “‘an invitation to manufacture evidence,”\nbecause a witness will offer a co-conspirator statement for the first time. (Def. Mot. l at 4). This\nargument is nonsensical and offensive. It is deeply unfortunate that defense counsel would so\ncasually resort to baseless allegations that the Government would manufacture evidence and\npresent false testimony at trial. And in any event, the Government produced to the defense Jencks\nAct material containing co-conspirator statements in its possession on October ll and will\ncontinue to make Jencks Act productions as it prepares for trial. To the extent the defense is\nconcemed that a witness will say something on the stand for the first time, the Government cannot\ndisclose that in advance because no lawyer can knou a witness’s verbatim answer in advance. But\nwere that to occur, the defense would be well positioned to cross-examine the witness. !°\n'S The defendant’s motion also makes the puzzling argument that co-conspirator statements are\nproblematic in this case because the defense is limited in its ability to call co-conspirators to testify\nas defense witnesses. (Def. Mot. l at 4). That is true in essentially every criminal case, as the\nCourt has previously noted. (See Op. & Order at l7-l8, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“There are also serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”)).\nIn any event, to the extent the defense takes issue with the rule that co-conspirator statements can\nbe admited without requiring the declarant to testify, that complaint is properly directed to the\ndrafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo677o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 63 of 84\n\nEven if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice\nare exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple electronic\ndevices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def. Mot. l at 3),\nany statements contained in emails or other documents that the Government plans to use at trial\nhave been marked as Government exhibits and produced to the defense. The defense need look\nno further than the Government’s exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.\nSimilarly, although the defense complains of “document dumps” (id. at 2) and the need to review\n“thousands of pages of newly provided discovery material” (id. at 7), any witness testimony\ncontaining co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government’s Jencks Act <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>—\nand specifically, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of material for testifying witnesses. Although the\nGovernment produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the\nGovernment does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the\ndefense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense\nknous exactly which declarants’ statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).!®\n\nFinally, and in any event, suppression is not a proper remedy. The defense relies\nprincipally on Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order\n'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial\nhave other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,\ninstructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions\nsubject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.\n\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo677l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007166.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page ll5 of l27 ll5\nLBl5max4\n\nl leter that I raised concerning legal mail, but we still have\n\n2 the issue that Ms. Maxwell has not received trial-related\n\n3 discovery that is imperative for her to review to consult with\n4 counsel.

Although generally “<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of impeaching evidence pursuant to Rule l7(c) is not required\nuntil after the witness testifies,” Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2, in this case the Government\nexpects each of the Minor Victims named in the subpoena to testify at trial. Accordingly, if the\nCourt permits enforcement of the subpoena, the Government does not object to <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the\nrecords to the Court before the Minor Victims actually testify for the sake of efficiency.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7394", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page3of8\nPage 3\n\nVictims];” (3) “[a]ny and all” material “submited by each [Minor Victim]” to the EVCP; and (4)\n“communications” between the EVCP and the Minor Victims or their counsel. (Def. Mot.\nAtachment A). The subpoena should be quashed as to each of these categories.?\n\nA. Payment Records\n\nThe first category—copies of payments made to the Minor Victims—concerns information\nalready in the defendant’s possession. Indeed, the defendant’s motion cites the amounts received\nby the Minor Victims, which is reflected in their 35oo material (Def. Mot. at 3), and the\nGovernment expects the Minor Victims to testify to those amounts at trial.\n\nAccordingly, this information is “otherwise procurable.” United States v. Pena, No. l5 Cr.\n55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6). The subpoena should therefore\nbe quashed. At most, the Court should order <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of that information to the Court so that it\nmay be provided to the defense in the unlikely event that the Minor Victims testify inconsistently\nwith their prior statements at trial.\n\nB. Claim Release Forms\n\nThe defendant makes no argument for the relevance of the release forms executed by the\nMinor Victims, and none is apparent to the Government. The Court should therefore quash the\nsubpoena insofar as it calls for that category of information, at least until the defendant explains\nwhat relevant and admissible evidence is contained in the release forms.\n3 The Government has standing to challenge the subpoena because it targets information about\nanticipated Government witnesses, “based on the Government’s ‘interest in preventing any undue\nlengthening of the trial, any undue harassment of the witness and [her] family, and any prejudicial\nover-emphasis on the witness’s credibility.’” United States v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l,57l (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 25, 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Giampa, No. 92 Cr. 437 (PKL), l992 WL 29644o, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, l992)). The Government has provided notice of this subpoena to the Minor\nVictims and is informed that at least two victims expect to file submissions regarding the subpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7395", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page 8of8\nPage 8\nrule as a discovery device.” United States v.

(Def. Mot. at l). To the extent the Court releases any records\nfrom the EVCP to the defendant, it should only release those records that comply with the Nixon\nstandard. See Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (“To avoid delay in trial, courts sometimes require\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of impeaching material to the court (but not to counsel), with the court reviewing these\ndocuments in camera and then disclosing any admissible documents only after the witness\ntestifies.”). For instance, if the Court identifies a prior inconsistent statement in only one\ndocument, no other records should be released to the defendant. And, in addition to evaluating\nwhether any statement is relevant to shou bias or as a prior inconsistent statement, the Court should\nconsider whether it is precluded under Rule 4o3, for the reasons described above.

But even if the privilege did\napply, it was waived when Mr. Glassman communicated the statement to the government. /d.\n\nThere is a second category of relevant and non-privileged testimony Mr. Glassman has to\noffer. Jane claimed to remember certain events happening in l994 because that was the year Mr.\nEpstein took her to see the Broadway <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of The Lion King. As the atached email\nexchange between AUSA and Mr. Edwards shous, the government quickly recognized a\nproblem with Jane’s story because The Lion King did not premiere on Broadway until l997. Ex.\nl (35o9- olo). AUSA Rossmiller and Mr. Glassman then exchanged emails in which AUSA\nRossmiller tried to massage the problem and not-so-subtly invited Jane to change her story to say\nthat she had actually seen The Lion King movie, not the play. But Jane, through Mr. Glassman,\ndoubled doun, saying in response to AUSA Rossmiller’s email she saw the Broadway\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of The Lion King, not the movie:\n\nBroadway play... Epstein bragged about being good friends with Julie Taymor, and\n\nwe had amazing first rou mezzanine seats they she had apparently given him.\n\nBx I,\n\nThere is nothing privileged about this evidence. At the request of AUSA Rossmiller, Mr.\nGlassman went back to Jane about her The Lion King story. Knouing that the request came from\nthe government, Jane stuck to her story, and Mr. Glassman communicated that response to the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo837o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 33 of 37\nwhich would have dated her trip to New Mexico, or when Epstein bought tickets to the\nBroadway <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of The Lion King for Jane, which she had originally told the FBI she saw\non her first trip to New York. Tr. 5o3-ll.\n\nC. Phone Records\n\nContemporaneous phone records for Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, the accusers, and others that\ncould have been used to rebut the government’s proof were also not available to the defense. For\nexample, Carolyn testified that Ms. Maxwell would call her to set up massage appointments. Tr.\nl527. This was important evidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the sex trafficking charges in Counts\nFive and Six. Carolyn’s claim could have been disproven with contemporaneous phone records.\nHouever, because a complete set of Ms. Maxwell’s phone records—as well as phone records for\nCarolyn, her mother, and her boyfriend—were not available, the defense could not challenge this\nclaim.\n\nD. Property Records\n\nThe defense also did not have access to property records for Epstein’s various residences,\nwhich would have rebuted the accusers’ testimony concerning the timing of the alleged sexual\nabuse. For example, Jane testified that she began being sexually molested by Epstein in his\nhome in New York when she was l4 years old. Tr. 3l6-32o. Jane described the house as\nfollous:\n\n[I]t looked more like a building than a house. It was eight stories, his massive\n\neight-story house building where you walk through these giant doors and then\n\nthere was, like, another security door to go in. And it had an elevator and it was\n\neight stories.\nTr. 3l7. It is clear that Jane was describing Epstein’s tounhouse on East 7l* Street. Moreover,\nher description of the massage room where she was molested matched photographs of the\nmassage room at the 7l“ Street house. Tr. 32o. Jane turned l4 years old in August l994.

(Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his questionnaire. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun questionnaire in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas.

See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas.

But in any event\nthe Government is not planning to offer this opinion in its direct examination of Flatley. Instead,\nit is responsive to an expected line of cross-examination: the defense notice for Examiner Kelso\nsuggests they will challenge whether the defendant ever used Government Exhibit 54. The login\ndata, which shous that the vast majority of logins occurred on the user account “Ghislaine,”\nundermines that claim. The defendant can hardly claim that the Government provided insufficient\nnotice of testimony it discussed with the witness in response to the defendant’s expert notice and\nwhich the Government would only elicit in response to cross-examination on the subject.\n\nThere is no further opinion contained in the December 5 notes.

Rajaratnam, o9 Cr. ll84\n(RJH), 2oll WL 72353o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2oll); see Fed. R. Crim. P. l6 Advisory\nCommitee Note—l974 Amend. (“The majority of the Advisory Commitee is of the view that\n... the giving a broader right of discovery to the defense is dependent upon giving also a broader\nright of discovery to the prosecution.”). When the defendant “avail[s herself] of the strategy to\nobtain discovery of the government, [s]he must comply with the requirement for reciprocal\ndiscovery”—even as to exhibits the defendant might introduce only if the defendant herself\ntestifies. United States v. Ryan, 448 F. Supp. 8lo, 8lo-ll (S.D.N.Y. l978).

Factual Background\n\nThe Government has made thirty-eight discovery productions to the defense under Rule\nl6(a), beginning on August 5, 2o2o, totaling over two million pages, triggering the defendant’s\nreciprocal discovery obligations under Rule l6(b). On June 2, 2o2l, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to produce its Jencks Act material and proposed exhibit list on October ll, and the\ndefendant to provide her Rule l6 disclosures on November 8—three weeks in advance of trial.\n(Dkt. No. 297). On November 8, 2o2l, the defendant provided the Government with a Rule l6\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\nOn December lo, 2o2l—more than a month later, shortly after the close of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of7\nGovernment’s case—the defendant provided a supplemental disclosure of material under Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A). Document “Rule l6 oo7” appears to be a sale agreement for the defendant’s home\nat 44 Kinnerton Street, London, dated December l9, l996. Lf rr\nes ee\n|\n\nAlthough the defense has not specified the relevance of this document, it appears to be\noffered in service of the argument that the defendant did not live at this address in l994, which is\nwhen Kate testified she first visited the defendant there. To be clear, the document does not\nactually establish that fact: The defendant herself has testified under oath that she lived in the 44\nKinnerton Street residence beginning in l992 or l993 (see Exhibit B), and even assuming the date\nof sale is accurate, it hardly precludes the possibility that the defendant lived there at an earlier\ndate.\n\nIll. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s decision to withhold the sale agreement until the close of the\nGovernment’s case violates her Rule l6 obligations. The records were within her possession,\ncustody, and control long before trial, and the theory for which the Government expects the\ndefendant to use the agreement has been apparent since the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Jencks\nAct material in mid-October, before the defendant’s initial Rule l6 deadline. By failing to disclose\nthe agreement until the close of the Government’s case, the defendant has prevented the\nGovernment from conducting a full investigation, causing prejudice to the Government. The Court\n2 Nor does it preclude the possibility that Kate was simply mistaken about which of the defendant’s\nLondon residences she first visited.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of7\nshould preclude the defendant from offering the agreement nou in her case-in chief.\n\nFirst, the agreement was in the defendant’s possession, custody, and control long before\ntrial. The sale agreement is a contract between the defendant herself and third parties. If a copy\nof the agreement was not in her personal possession, it surely was obtainable through her counsel\nin that transaction—who is expected to testify at trial.\n\nSecond, as noted, the theory of relevance for the sale agreement that the Government\nanticipates has been clear since long before the defendant’s Rule l6 deadline. The Government\nexpects that the defendant will try to use the agreement to shou that she did not purchase the\ntounhome on Kinnerton Street until January l997. Kate testified that she visited that home in\nl994, when she was l7. (Tr. ll76).\n\nKate’s testimony was not a surprise to the defense. Kate described the home in an interview\nwith the Government on September l, 2o2l, a report of which was produced to the defense on\nOctober ll. See 35l3-o37 at 8 (FBI 3o2); 35l3-o38 at l2 (underlying notes). Although Kate did\nnot give the street address, she identified the house’s location as across the street from the Nags\nHead Pub. That fact did not go unnoticed by the defense, which made a point of confirming with\nKate on cross examination specifically that the defendant lived on Kinnerton Street across from\nthe Nags Head Pub—twice. Tr. l235, l253-54. Even before the Government produced its 35oo\nmaterial, the defense previewed its view that Kate’s timeline is incorrect and she was older at the\ntime of certain events than she testified she was. See ll/ol/2l Tr. at 89 (“It’s quite possible, in\nfact likely, that [Kate] is older than [l7].””). The defense has been planning to challenge Kate’s\ntestimony on this point for quite some time, and it knew that Kate said she visited the Kinnerton\nStreet home. Yet the defense did not produce the sale agreement in its Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o5 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagelofl2\n2) Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nJeffrey Pagliuca\nHADDON\nMook oe N l5o East loth Avenue\nSOUS ee be Denver, Colorado 8o2o3\nPH 3o3.83l.7364 Fx 3o3.832.2628\nwww.hmilaw.com\njpagliuca@hmflaw.com\nMay l2, 2o2l\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

In her ex-parte\napplication, Ms. Maxwell provided reasons for requesting certain items of evidence, including\nthat the government either failed to secure the evidence or refused to produce it to Ms. Maxwell;\nshe also disclosed theories related to her defense, strategy, and work product.\nAfter considering the application and BSF’s response, the Court invited comment from\nthe government regarding subpoenaed items 9 (a journal), lo (boots), and ll(photographs).\nSpecifically, the Court directed the government “to notify the Court of its views as to Requests 9\nthrough ll.” Dkt. 252.\nThe government’s position is consistent with its general approach to evidence in this case\nwhich is to blindly accept information it considers unfavorable to Ms. Maxwell, begrudgingly\nDOJ-OGR-oooll24l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 ofl2\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to\ninvestigate her defense without interference from the government.

Yet the defendant did not subpoena Bovino until November 3o, 2o2l. And as the\ndefendant admits, she has not been in contact with Bovino since the service of the subpoena, two\nand a half weeks ago.\n\nThe Government rested on Friday, November lo, 2o2l, as it had previewed for several\ndays prior. Follouing that time, the defendant had five days without trial during which to prepare\nthe defense case-in-chief. On the day the Government rested, the defendant suggested that the\ndefense case would last only a few days, and as recently as yesterday, the defendant suggested that\nshe would rest today, but for one witness who might carry over to Monday. Tr. 2534.\n\nIt was not until this morning that the defendant brought Bovino’s apparent noncompliance\nto the Court’s atention. It also appears that the defense would otherwise rest today. The defendant\nhas slept on her rights, and the Court should not sign the arrest warrant or grant a continuance to\nallou the Marshals time to find Bovino and bring her to Court.\n\nIt is well setled that a “district court has broad discretion to grant or deny a motion to\ncontinue.” See United States v.

Nos. 252, 298, the Court here authorized and\nissued Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena to the EVCP, concluding (preliminarily and correctly) that it\nwas proper under Rule l7(c). See Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d at 56l (“As the Supreme Court has\nexplained, it is the responsibility of the court, not the opposing party, to ensure that a subpoena\nsecured under Rule l7(c) is for a proper purpose.” (citing United States v. Tomison, 969 F. Supp.\n587, 594 (E.D. Cal. l997))). Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena seeks <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> aft trial (not pretrial), and\nit also requests that before the responsive material is produced to her for inspection, this Court\nconduct an in camera review. Combined with the narrouness of her request, Ms. Maxwell has\nsuggested careful procedures to balance her need for the material and the accusers’ interests in\nconfidentiality.\n\nEveryone agrees that Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena specifically identifies the requested\nmaterial, and there is no meaningful dispute that the material she seeks is both relevant and not\notherwise procurable. (The government and Accuser-2 offer cursory arguments about relevance,\nwhich are easily dismissed.)

Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span>—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption. United States v.\nDominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986); see also United States v. Matis, No. 2o-l7l3,\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9888", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019889.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DtamteHPl &Pitdd BFPO Pagers G2o\n2o2o WL 3536277, at *4—5 (2d Cir.

Ms. Maxwell Has Rebuted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight\n\nRisk. and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No\n\nCombination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her\n\nPresence In Court\n\nThe government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions\nwill reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool9889", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019934.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page75 of 2oo La\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl and federal law disclosure obligations.\n\n2 Go ahead, Ms. Moe.\n\n3 MS.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed.

(Dkt. 66). Despite numerous atempts\nto fix these problems over the succeeding weeks, including producing a replacement hard drive\ncontaining these productions, the problems were not resolved and the replacement hard drive was\nbroken. In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense\nalerted the government to these problems, contained some of the same technical problems and\nincluded a significant number of unreadable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the\nsixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable discovery for over four months.’ Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the discovery.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine. On\nNovember l8, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in l4-day quarantine due\nto contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving team of guards assigned to Ms.\nMaxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their oun COVID outbreaks,\nheightens her exposure to the virus.

It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\ntechnical problems. We note, houever, that nou that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has\naccess to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot\nbecause of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer.\n\n37\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020070.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctIMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FHgPagetl Oost 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).

Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel.

The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine.

In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC.

The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population.

Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020111.jpg": "CaSedeZot epQC33ouAUNt Bescutrentl lo22 lF iO 827o8/2 og Pagel d Ob l5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nIl.

Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020134.jpg": "CaGadeZOtepQ)d3GOuAuNt Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2o9o Faget 7l Ob 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020135.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAuNit Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9o Fagef d Ob 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020196.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageblGhl2\nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense\nspecifically enumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or\ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the\ncommunity or others. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“[A] defendant must\nintroduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).\nNonetheless, “‘the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing\nevidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’” English, 629 F.3d at\n3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>,” houever, “the presumption favoring\ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol96", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020197.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageblGhl2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020215.jpg": "Cased 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BU l FROG O22o6/2agFAageo’ 6l6\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020216.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAt BO l FROG o22o6 /2agFages8 6l6\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020249.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel5 of 25\nARGUMENT\nThe District Court Properly Denied Maxwell’s Motions for Bail and\nTemporary Release\n\n27.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020296.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page6 of 3o\noccurred here.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial.

On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions.

It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED.

The Court is in receipt of the parties’ leters regarding\nthe issue of potential cross-examination that might elicit identifying information in\nviolation of this Court's order. See Dkt. No. 5l9. The Government is hereby ORDERED\nto provide to the Defense the information it believes falls within the categories of\nspecifically identifying information for the current testifying witness no later than 7:oo\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 78/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o7oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020788.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7o of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 34\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to\ndisclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte declaration in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is m the custody ofa civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020789.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993).

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n4 Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\na The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021269.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NOS 3536o38, Page97 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.'!” At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\n2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[nJegotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend|[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l269", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021377.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o3 3536o38, Page2o5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 348\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “‘pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain ‘“‘an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l377", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021378.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o38, Page2o6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it aclose read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers.?™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l378", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents.

Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.5 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*”> As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\n372 Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\nae Doe, Order to Compel <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\ncual The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\nBia This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l44l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 387 3536o39, Page33 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*”\n\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021489.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Paged9 of 2l7\nSA-3l3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l489", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021978.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl7 Filed l2/l9/l9 Page2ofl5 2\nJbpWnoeC\n\nl THE COURT: Good afternoon.\n\n2 We're here in the mater of United States v.

Noel and Thomas,\nl9 Cr. 83o (AT)\n\nDear Judge Torres:\n\nThe Government respectfully writes in response to the defendants’ leters of January 27,\n2o2o, requesting at least a six-month adjournment of the trial date in the above-captioned case,\nwhich is currently scheduled to commence on April 2o, 2o2o. The Government remains prepared\nto proceed to trial as scheduled. As is set forth more fully belou, while the Government has no\nobjection to a brief adjournment of the trial date subject to the Court’s availability, the requested\nsix-month adjournment is both unnecessary and unwarranted.\n\nBy way of background, as is set forth in the Indictment, the charges in this case relate to a\nperiod of just over l4 hours—from approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately\n6:3o a.m. the follouing day, August lo, 2ol9. The Government has made three discovery\nproductions—(l) the main <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> on December 3l, 2ol9; (2) a small supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\non January 23, 2o2o; and (3) a reproduction of video surveillance footage with timestamps on\nJanuary 24, 2o2o.' While the December 3l, 2ol9 discovery <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> consisted of a large\nnumber of pages of materials, many of those materials were produced principally in anticipation\nof defense requests and to help facilitate the very sort of broader investigation the defendants nou\nclaim they need to undertake. For example, the Government produced MCC video surveillance\nfor a period of longer than one month (July 5, 2ol9 to August l2, 2ol9); count slips for nearly\nthree weeks (July 23, 2ol9 to August l4, 2ol9); thirty-minute round reports for more than a month\n(July l, 2ol9 to August lo, 2ol9); and materials relating to the events of July 23, 2ol9. Similarly,\nwith respect to defendant Noel, the Government provided in discovery to her only a report from\nher cellphone, which consists of more than 2o,ooo pages, very few of which, if any, are relevant\nto the pending charges. For substantially the same reasons, and as the Court is aware, the\n' For the third <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>, the Government requested additional hard drives from defense counsel.\nTo date, only Noel’s counsel provided a hard drive to the Government, which the Government\nthen loaded and returned to counsel. The Government stands ready to do the same for Thomas as\nsoon as a hard drive is provided.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l998", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021999.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 22 Filed ol/28/2o Page 2of3\nJanuary 28, 2o2o\nPage 2\nGovernment also produced 35oo material for every individual interviewed during the investigation\nin December, nearly four months in advance of trial.\n\n‘Whether or not to adjourn a trial date is traditionally within the discretion of the trial\njudge.” United States v. Scopo, 86l F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. l988) (internal quotations omited).\nWhile there “is no mechanical test with respect to requests for a continuance or adjournment,”\nUnited States v. Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022025.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 2 of 38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA.

BACKGROUND\nA The Indictment Alleges that Mr. Thomas Conspired with Co-Defendant,\nNoel. and Created Faise Records\nThe government’s investigation in this case began upon the discovery of the alleged\nsuicide of Jeffrey Epstein, on August lo, 2ol9, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\n| (“MCC”).\nAt that time, Mr. Thomas, and Co-Defendant, Noel, were on duty as correctional officers\nin the section of the MCC, knoun as the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).\nThe indictment (Indictment, Introduction at l), alleges, among other things, that certain |\nprison counts, in other words, physically counting the prisoners in the cells, were not made by |\n. the defendants. In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred. (7d.)\nThus, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy. (Indictment, Count One at {\n28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records. (Indictment,\nCount Four at 7 l5.) Defendant, Thomas, is not charged in Counts Two and Three of the\nindictment.\nB. Mr. Thomas’ Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Requests for <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span>\nof Documents Have Been Denied\nOn December l6, 2ol9, the parties agreed to a protective order as to discovery, and on\nthat day this Court entered same (Docket # l3). On January 29, 2o2o, defendant, Thomas, made\ncertain requests to the government under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n(See Exhibit A.) Approximately, forty-five days later, on March l4, 2o2o, the government\nresponded to the requests made by defendant, Thomas with a one sentence denial of said request.\nThe substance of the response was that the defendant should refer to the government’s responses\nmade at the pretrial conference of November 25, 2ol9. (ll/25/2ol9 - Docket Minute Entry).\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022030.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 7 of 38\nThis refusal is perplexing and nonsensical because these same government prosecutors presented\nthe defendant with a consent to search document from the office of the Inspector General. (See\nExhibit C.)\n\nThis motion concerns the defense requests for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents regarding\nimportant and essential issues in this case. Moreover, the public sphere is replete with\ninformation that the Inspector General of the United States opened an investigation into the\ncircumstances surrounding the death of Iefitey Epstein. (See article atached as Exhibit D.)\n\n| Additionally, it is undisputed that the Inspector General also conducted an extensive\ninvestigation into inner workings of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). The United States Atorney\nGeneral, William Barr and the Acting Bureau of Prisons commissioner, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer\nboth made numerous public statements that the Inspector General was undertaking an in-depth\ninvestigation into the Bureau of Prisons’ policies, procedures, staffing and criminal conduct as a\ndirect result of the death of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC on August lo, 2ol9. (See Exhibit D.) This\nreport is important because the defendant believes that this report will contain information that is\nmaterial and relevant to his defense. Moreover, it is the defendant’s assertion that staffing issues,\nstarfing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP procedures go\nto the heart ofhis defense to the government’s criminal allegations.\n\nThe government’s response to Mr. Thomas’ discovery request was not detailed and\nsunply made a blanket denial without giving Mr. Thomas the respect to state any legal\njustification for the denial. Defendant, Thomas, therefore, brings this Motion to Compel, as to\nthe items originally requested by his counsel. |\n\nCc. The Inspector General’s Report and Any Other Reports, Documents,\n\nand/or Memoranda Made by Other Federal Agencies Investigating the\nIncident Surrounding the Death of Jeffrey Epstein Are Discoverable and\nMust Be Produced\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o3o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022038.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l5 of 38\ngovernment agencies because it is highly relevant to Mr. Thornas’ defense in this case.\nFurthermore, the government had Mr. Thomas sign a consent form specifically from the\nInspector General’s office. (See Exhibit C.) Thereafter, the government tumed over the results of\nthis search in the normal course of discovery <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>. This fact shous that the Inspector\nGeneral was investigating this incident thus all information they receive is discoverable. This\nCourt should order the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the documents within forty-five (45) days from the entry of\nan order on this motion.\n\nB. Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Include the <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> of Documents and —\n\nReports Generated by Other Agencies\n\nThe facts, shoun above as reported in the media and secondary sources, clearly shou that\nother agencies were involved in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein’s death and the defendant’s\narrest and indictment. Thus, clearly, this Court should not permit the government to selflimit\ndiscovery. A prosecutor is not \"alloued to avoid disclosure of evidence by the simple expedient\nof leaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another agency while utilizing his access to\nit in preparing his case for trial.\" United States v. Trevino, 556 F.2d l265, l272 (5th Cir.l977);\n\nU.S. v. Giffen, 379 F. Supp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4)\n\nIn United States v. Bryan, 868 F.2d lo32 (9th Cir.l989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 858, llo\nS.Ct. l67, lo7 L.Ed.2d l24 (l989), after a nationwide investigation by the IRS, Bryan had been\nconvicted of, among other things, conspiracy to defraud the United States. Bryan sought\ndiscovery, under Rule l6(a)(l)(C) of items that were in the possession of the FBI. The charges\nagainst Bryan stemmed from the IRS investigation, and this difference, together with the further\nobjection that <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> should be limited only to documents found in the District in which the\nmater was pending, Oregon, formed the basis of the government’s objection.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o38", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022039.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l6 of 38\n\nBryan argued, conversely, that the ‘government’ under the Rule, included not only the\nprosecutors, but also any closely connected investigative agencies. The Court dispensed with the\n‘out of District’ argument by the government, ruling that Rule l6 was not so limiting.\n\nWith respect to the issue of <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of items from other closely connected agencies,\nthe Court found in favor of Bryan as far as discovery of items by such agencies. In seting forth\nthe rule, the Court said: “The prosecutor will be deemed to have knouledge of and access to\nanything im the possession, custody and control of any federal agency participating in the same\ninvestigation of the defendant.” Jd.at lo36.\n\nThe District Courts of New York have folloued Bryan, supra. In United States of\nAmerica v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 2o4 (E.D.N.Y. l999), also a corrections/police officer case,\nthe Court found that the materials were discoverable from any other agencies “allied with the\nprosecution.” Jd. at 2l, In addition, in citing to Bryan, supra, the Court stated that: “Another\nfactor in the analysis is whether or not the prosecution has access to the materials.” fd\n\nIn this mater, defendant, Thomas, has shoun that other agencies ‘allied with the\nprosecution,” have and/or are, participating with each other. The statement of Atorney General,\nWilliam Barr, confirms that a separate investigation was initiated by the Inspector General.\nAdditionally, it seems more than obvious that the internal affairs division within the BOP\nconducted a separate investigation into the events in questions. Importantly, Rule l6 focuses on\nthe preparation of the defense. Therefore, documents are material under Rule l6 and subject to\ndisclosure if they help the defense to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the government’s\ncase. Marshall, l32 F.3d at 67-68.\n\nOther Districts have also folloued Bryan. In United States v. Libby, 432 F. Supp. 8l\n(D.D.C. 2oo6), the Court was faced with a motion to compel, by defendant, I. ‘Scooter’ Libby, in\nthe Valerie Plame CIA leak case. The mater concerning Libby concerned whether he lied as to\nthe disclosures as to Plame. Libby sought documents which, as the Court pointed out, were of a\n\n: 42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022040.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Pagel7 of 38\nfar-reaching nature, including documents related to a revenge issue as to Valerie Plame, and her |\nlate husband, Ambassador Wilson. The Court in Libby ruled in favor for the defense and granted\nthe motion to compel discavery in several key areas of the case. ,\nThis Court will find Libby, supra, important because the Court’s decision in that case\nfocused on “all agencies” that have information regarding the offenses charged. In the instant ,\n| mater, therefore, it will not be enough for the government to state that other agencies may not be\nallied with the prosecution, or that the government lacks access to the documents. If the\n| documents provide exculpatory evidence, and are related to the issues in the indictment, they\nmust be produced.\nIn Marshall, l32 F.3d at 63, the defendant was charged in a drug related transaction.\nThere were records on visitation from the local jail where the defendant was incarcerated, pager\nrecords, the pager, and local records from the county public records about a traffic stop. These\nitems were uncovered by the government agents investigating the mater, but only after\ndiscovery had been concluded. During the course of the trial, the Court took a four-day\nadjournment, in order to address the newly discovered evidence. The trial judge decided to\nexclude all of the newly discovered evidence, and, as a result, Marshall was found guilty. On\nappeal, the government argued that, in fact, the newly discovered evidence, under Rule l6,\ntended to incriminate, not exculpate Marshall. On appeal, the Court disagreed, citing Rule\nl6(a)(l)(C} as requiring the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of items that are material to the preparation of the\ndefendant’s case. The Court, in addition, rejected the government’s argument, that the items\nmust be ‘materially exculpatory,’ Jd. at 68. In announcing the rule, that Court stated: “In United\nStates v. Lloyd, we said that evidence is material under Rule l6 ‘as long as there is a strong\nindication that it will play an important role in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness\npreparation, corroborating testimony, or assisting impeachment or rebutal.” See Lloyd at 35l.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022041.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l8 of 38\nUndoubtedly, the government is going to assert that the requested documents in this\nmotion are not relevant or material and do not bear on the charges as they relate to the conduct\nthat did or did not take place on August lo, 2ol9. The documents sought are material if they will\nhelp the defense with trial preparation tasks such as evaluating the strength of the government’s\ncase, investigating possible defenses, finding additional relevant evidence, and developing\nstrategies to impeach government witnesses. See United States v. Safavian, 233 F.R.D. l2\n(D.D.C. 2oo5) It is not up to the government to define Mr. Thomas’ defenses to the indictment or\nto determine what is useful in preparing them.\nFor these reasons, this Court should include the requirement of the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of both\ninculpatory and exculpatory evidence in any order granting this motion to compel.\nAt this juncture, houever, the government has made, at best, a token objection to the\n| discovery by citing to a terse denial made at a previous court appearance.\nMr. Thomas, therefore, cannot guess what may be other objections, but this Court should\noverrule any such atestations as going against fundamental fairness.\nC. The Reports and Documents Requested Are Discoverable Under Bradv\nThis motion has articulated several rationales ypon which the defendant in this mater is\nentitled to much more information than the government is voluntarily willing to disclose. The\ngovernment’s disclosure obligations do not end with Rule l6. Much of the discovery sought by\nthis motion is firmly rooted within the scriptures of documents that must be disclosed under the\ndoctrine set forth in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963), and its progeny.\nUnder Brady, the government has an affirmative duty to produce any evidence favorable\nto the defendant that is material to cither guilt or punishment. See United States v. Bagley, 473\nU.S. 667, 674-75 (l985) (the prosecution is required “to disclose evidence favorable to the\naccused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial”). Both exculpatory\ninformation and evidence that can be used to impeach the prosecution’s witnesses are considered\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022042.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l9 of 38\n“favorable” under Brady and must be disclosed by the government. Jd. at 676-77; see also Giglio\nv. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o, l54-55 (l972); In re Sealed Case No. 99-3o96 (Brady\nObligations), l85 F.3d 887, 892 (D.C. Cir. l999). Moreover, the defense is already in possession\nof witness statements that one or both of the defendants in this indictment may have conducted\nrounds or inmate counts on August lo, 2ol9. Accordingly, there is a logical assumption that\nthere might be additional exculpatory statements contained in the Inspector General’s report or\ncertain internal reports maintained by the BOP internal affairs division or other government\nagencies that were conducting a contemporaneous investigation with FBI.\n\nThe prosecution must produce to the defense not only all favorable evidence that is\nadmissible, but also all evidence “that is likely to lead to favorable evidence that would be\nadmissible.” Safavian, 233 at l7 (quoting United States v. Sudikoff, 36 F. Supp. 2d ll96, ll98-\n99 (C.D,Cal, l999)). Just as with Rule l6 disclosure, the government must interpret its Brady\nobligations broadly. “Where doubt exists as to the usefulness of the evidence to the defendant,\nthe government must resolve all such doubts in favor of full disclosure.” fd. (citing United States\nv. Paxson, 86l F.2d 73o, 737 (D.C. Cir. l988). Without question, the Brady disclosure\nobligation is broader than Rule l6 because it requires <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> not just of documents, but also\nof information knoun to the government that has been documented in some fashion.\n\n. In Safavian, the court explained the materiality standard under Brady that applies to\npretrial discovery: .\n[T]he government must always produce any potentially\n\nexculpatory or otherwise favorable evidence without regard to hou\nthe withholding of such evidence might be viewed-- with the\nbenefit of hindsight--as affecting the outcome of the trial. The\nquestion before trial is not whether the government thinks that\ndisclosure of the information or evidence it is considering\nwithholding might change the outcome of the trial going forward,\nbut whether the evidence is favorable and therefore must be\ndisclosed.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022043.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 2o of 38\nid. at l6 (citing cases); see also United States v.

The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period,\nfrom approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day,\nAugust lo, 2ol9, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As\ncharged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated\ncounts of prisoners housed in MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), but nevertheless signed false\ncertifications atesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the\nSHU were conducted from approximately lo:3o p.m. on August 9 to 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nI. Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants’ Request for Additional Materials\n\nA. The Government’s Discovery <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span>\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2ol9, the Court set a discovery deadline\nof December 3l, 2ol9. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the\nGovernment made a substantial discovery <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> to both defendants, consisting in part of the\nfollouing: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by\nNoel and Thomas from August 9 to lo, 2ol9; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC\nphone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness\ninterviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG\nwho were participating in the investigation.”\n\nSubsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more\nlimited in scope. On January 23, 2o2o, the Government produced additional interview reports and\n\n? The Government does not concede that <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of all of the materials was required\nunder Rule l6, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of\ncaution.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022071.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 9 of 34\nnotes. On January 3o, 2o2o,°? the Government reproduced video surveillance footage with\ntimestamps, and on March l6, 2o2o, the Government produced forensic reports for three electronic\ndevices and a photograph of a text message.\n\nB. Defense Requests for Additional Discovery Materials\n\nThe defendants have made a number of requests for additional discovery materials, in\nresponse to which the Government has provided information in its possession as consistent with\nRule l6 and its other disclosure obligations, as described belou.\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November ll, 2ol9, Thomas, through counsel, raised\nthe issue of an “ongoing . . . report” by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the\n“status” of the report and when it would be completed.* (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2ol9, at 3-4, 7-9).\nIn response, the Government explained that “to the extent counsel’s asking for a summary of the\nresults of the criminal investigation, obviously we’ll be turning over in discovery all of the\nunderlying results of the criminal investigation. . . . I don’t have a time frame on the [I]nspector\n[G]eneral report, but the [G]overnment will produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery\nmaterials in this mater, which includes the Rule l6 materials relevant to the criminal charges that\nhave been brought against the defendants.” (/d. at 7-8). As there was no pending issue to resolve,\nthe Court declined to rule at that time.\n\nOn January 29, 2o2o, Thomas and Noel each submited discovery requests to the\nGovernment. Thomas’s leter reiterated his prior request for “any and all reports, memorandums,\n\n3 The January 3o, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> was made to Noel’s counsel on January 24, 2o2o, while\nthe Government was still waiting for an additional hard drive from Thomas’s counsel.\n\n* Based on conversations with atorneys at DOJ-OIG tasked with preparing this report, the\nGovernment understands that the report will likely focus on the events surrounding the death of\nJeffrey Epstein and BOP policies and procedures.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022075.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l3 of 34\ndemand for it. 267 F.3d at l46. The court held that as a general rule, Brady and its progeny do\nnot require immediate disclosure of all impeachment material upon a defendant’s request. Jd. It\nfound that the time required for its effective use would depend on the materiality of the evidence\nas well as the particular circumstances of the case, and suggested that district courts may order\ndisclosure of material it deems material as a mater of case management. Jd. As described above,\nthe Government disclosed reports and notes of witness statements as part of its discovery\nproductions, such that the defendants will have possessed substantial material that may serve as\npotential impeachment evidence for one year in advance of trial.\n\nB. Rule l6\n\nRule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Government to permit the\ndefendants to inspect and copy documents and objects within the Government’s possession,\ncustody, or control if the items are material to preparing the defense, if the Government intends to\nuse them in its case-in-chief at trial, or if the items were obtained from or belong to the defendant.\nFed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(E). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule l6 “if it\ncould be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.” United States v. Stevens,\n985 F.2d ll75, ll8o-8l (2d Cir. l993).\n\nI. Thomas is Not Entitled to Additional Materials\n\nA. The Government Has Satisfied its Discovery and Disclosure Obligations\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government is aware of, has satisfied, and will continue to satisfy\nits discovery and disclosure obligations.\n\nThe Government has met its Rule l6 discovery and disclosure obligations. As set forth\nabove, the Government has produced an expansive amount of discovery, which includes among\nother things, hundreds of hours of video surveillance going back to July 5, 2ol9 (despite the fact\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022076.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l4 of 34\nthat the Indictment relates to a l4-hour time period); count slips, thirty minute round forms, and\nstaffing rosters for the three-week period surrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone\nrecords; employee files and staffing history for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of writen\nBureau of Prison policies and regulations, among other documents and materials. In addition and\nwhile not required by Rule l6, the Government produced months in advance of trial (and nou,\napproximately a year in advance of trial) statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the\ninvestigation. While the Government is not aware of any other information that warrants\ndisclosure, it will produce any such materials to the extent it becomes aware of them.\n\nThe Government is likewise aware of, and has complied with, its Brady and Giglio\nobligations. The Government has already produced any evidence in its possession that is arguably\nexculpatory or impeaching. To the extent Giglio material exists in notes of witness statements or\natorney proffers made on behalf of witnesses that have not already been produced, the\nGovernment intends to comply with its obligations and will make such disclosures sufficiently in\nadvance of trial to be effectively used. Based on that representation alone, the defendant’s motion\nshould be denied. See United States v. Gonzalez, No. l9 Cr. l23-2 (NRB), 2o2o WL l8o9293, at\n*5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2o2o) (denying a motion to compel because the government “represented\nthat it had complied with and would continue to comply with its Brady and Rule l6 obligations);\nUnited States v. Underwood, No. o4 Cr. 424 (RWS), 2oo5 WL 927ol2, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2l,\n2oo5) (“The courts of this Circuit repeatedly have denied pretrial requests for discovery orders\npursuant to Brady where the government has made such good faith representations.”); United\nStates v. Perez, 94o F. Supp. 54o, 553 (S.D.N.Y. l996) (denying defendant’s motion to compel\n<span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of Brady based on Government’s representation that it was aware of and had complied\nwith Brady).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o76", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022082.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 2o of 34\nirrelevant maters, such as what “led” him to the criminal conduct or the broader “context” in\nwhich he commited specific criminal acts. There is no basis to compel <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of evidence\nrelated to those maters under Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio because they are not material and because\nthe evidence sought is in furtherance of a transparent atempt at nullification. Thomas’s motion\nshould be denied on this basis alone.\n\nC. The Government is Not Required to Collect Materials From Agencies Who\n\nWere Not Part of the Prosecution Team\n\nThomas asks the Court to compel the Government to produce “any reports, witness\nstatements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the\nBOP,” “documents, reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC\nemployees who have engaged in the same or similar conduct,” and any previously undisclosed\nreports, witness statements, and documents created by “any other federal agencies that investigated\nthe circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein.” (Mot. 4, 7 (emphasis added)).

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\n\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”\n\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\n\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\n\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\n\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\n\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\n\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\n\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\n\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\n\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\n\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\n\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\n\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\n\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\n\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nie The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023107.jpg": "to the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!'? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement.

Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023216.jpg": "with one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers.?”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023236.jpg": "iFyoc have additental questions whieh ivalve thes ater, please contact (he office lisled above.

Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?’\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\naio OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023277.jpg": "leter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\n3l2 Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\n\n373 Doe, Order to Compel <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\na The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23277", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023299.jpg": "require victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\n\nWW. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners. Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l8.\n\n4o9 Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l9, l22l.\n26l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23299", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.jpg": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023325.jpg": "METHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDe EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023418.jpg": "ll. Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 to Another Institution and Failure\n\nto Replace Him with Another Inmate\n\nA. Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB. MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Atorney's Request that Epstein be Housed\n\nWithout a Cellmate\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023496.jpg": "Fwd: RE: United States v.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\nR In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023085.tif": "equipment.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\n\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”\n\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\n\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\n\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\n\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\n\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\n\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\n\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\n\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\n\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\n\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\n\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\n\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\n\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\n\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n™ Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nl% The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023107.tif": "to the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!'? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023215.tif": "the federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.””» Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023216.tif": "with one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers.?”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n2s4 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\n\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023236.tif": "iFyoc have additental questions whieh gvolve thes ater, please contact (he office lisled above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023277.tif": "leter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]*”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\n372 Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\n\n373 Doe, Order to Compel <span class=\"highlight\">Production</span> and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\n374 The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23277", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023299.tif": "require victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for <span class=\"highlight\">production</span>\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023325.tif": "METHODOLOGY\n\nA.

The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to <span class=\"highlight\">production</span> requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2. EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023793.tif": "Electronic Discovery Authorization Form — MDC Brooklyn & MCC New York\nInmate Name & Register Number: | Federal Criminal Case No. & District:\nNumber of CDs/DVDs:; Requesting Atorney's Name, State Bar No. & Contact Information (Business Address,\nPhone No., Fax.
