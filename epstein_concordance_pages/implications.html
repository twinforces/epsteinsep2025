It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v.

Hansen, lo8 F.

The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A\ndefendant may not seek to establish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal\nacts on specific occasions.”); United States v. Chambers, 8oo F. App’x 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“A\nsingle occurrence of lawful conduct is ‘simply irrelevant’ to other occurrences of lawful conduct.”\n(quoting United States v. Walker, l9l F.3d 326, 336 (2d Cir. l999)); United States v. Williams,\n2o5 F.3d 23, 34 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We reject Williams’s assertion that the evidence of innocent\ntravel was necessary to rebut the government's allegation that Williams had been involved in other\ncocaine importations from Jamaica. Although the government did argue that Williams had been\ninvolved in other importations, it did not allege that Williams had engaged in drug activity during\nthese particular trips.”); United States v. Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is irrelevant to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v. Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,\n748 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (“Defendants also claim that the Southern District was in possession of\nexculpatory materials which it did not disclose, namely that Gravano had discussed drug deals\nwith a number of ‘captains’ in the Gambino crime family, but had no such conversations with John\nGambino. Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v. Diaz, l76 F.3d 52, 99 (2d Cir. l999) (co-conspirators\nin racketeering case continued to commit crimes without defendant after defendant’s\nincarceration).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses.

OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators.

He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 65 of 8o\n\nWhen we review the statement in its full context, it is clear that, when D.A.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span>\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. <span class=\"highlight\">Implications</span> for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

The authors reported\nthat parents did shou a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to\nthe disclosure.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct\nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,\nsignificant proportions disclosed follouing prompts rather than it being\ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2oo4). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews\n\n. . with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in\n‘Investigating the investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children.\nprecise McElvaney (2oo8) found that parents’ questioning of children was prompted\ncircumstances that by their concern about the young person’s emotional distress.

Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span>\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. <span class=\"highlight\">Implications</span> for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer. [CONFIDENTIAL] SDNY _GM_ SUPP _oo2l9ooo.mov.\n\nThe materials reviewed reflect that Jeffrey Epstein was a brilliant man who was flawed\nby enduring personality traits familiar to psychiatrists as “Cluster B personality traits,” found\namong those with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 3o of 375\n\nLoftus, E.F., Smith, K.D., Johnson, D.A., & Fiedler, J.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

A juror is found by the judge to be\npartial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality based upon the\njuror’s voir dire answers.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (internal citation omited); see United States v.\nHaynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir.l968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir\ndire admission by the prospective juror of a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s interest’’).\n\nThis Court asked jurors about their history of sexual abuse because of the traumatic\n<span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> for victims of abuse and the strong likelihood of bias where the issue to be tried is\nwhether complainants in fact were sexually abused. Psychological studies support this common\nsense conclusion. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies of childhood sexual abuse victims siting\nas mock jurors in sex abuse cases “revealed that, compared with others, mock jurors with abuse\nexperience (sexually abused themselves or knew other victims) had higher levels of child victim\nempathy and, in turn, perceived the victim to be more credible and assigned more guilt to\ndefendants.” Child Victim Empathy Mediates The Influence Of Jurors’ Sexual Abuse Case\nJudgments: Metanalysis, 26 Pyschol. Pub. Pol’y & L. 3l2, 328 (2o2o); see also id. at 325\n(“Psychologists serving as jury consultants have concurred with the later: ‘Sexually based\noffenses are particularly complicated because jurors may possess personal victimization histories\n... Jurors with personal abuse histories are unlikely to be impartial.’’).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s press statements reflect actual bias. He stated his oun sexual abuse\nexperience predisposed him to credit the stories of sexual abuse complainants despite delays in\nreporting and memory lapses. His oun experience, in his oun mind, left him predisposed to reject\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009201.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page ll of 32\nchildhood sexual abuse; and (3) had he answered the questions accurately he would have been\nchallenged for cause and disqualified.\n\nThe Law\nI.

Ghislaine Maxwell, No. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)\nDear Judge Preska:\n\nI write in response to the Court’s Order of August 3, 2o2o (Doc. lo69), the Order and\nProtocol for Unsealing Decided Motions (Doc. lo44) (“Protocol”), and to raise with the Court\nthe legal effect of new information that came to the atention of counsel for Ms. Maxwell on\nFriday, August 7, 2o2o.\n\nNew information: On Friday, August 7, 2o2o, counsel for Ms. Maxwell learned of\ncritical new information that impacts both this action and U.S. v. Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n(the “Criminal Action”). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell’s right to due process and\nfairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit’s review of the Court’s unsealing\norder of July 23, 2o2o. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal\ndefendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nCounsel makes the representations about <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> of the new information as an\nofficer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because\nit is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use “for any civil\nproceeding or any purpose other than the defense” of the criminal action absent “further order\nof the Court.” Protective Order, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) at {¥ l(a), l8 (Exhibit A). As required by\nthat Protective Order and Judge Nathan’s Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, counsel\ninitiated a conferral with the U.S. Atorney’s Office over the weekend concerning a\nmodification of the Protective Order to share the information with this Court and the Second\nCircuit. Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the Protective Order\nin the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with\nthis Court, ex parte and in camera if necessary, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under\nseal if necessary).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool932l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">implications</span> of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386\n"};
