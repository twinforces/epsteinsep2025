Intervenor has witnessed the\nsame patern of political/ judicial corruption at work in his oun case; and has nou identified the same\nconspiracy at work in this case.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\ne intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2ol2/2ol3,\nintervenor filed a whistleblouer complaint with the Washington State Auditor’s Office. The\ncomplaint was escalated to Michael Horouitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A\nCase l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration). OIG refused to investigate the\ncomplaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges\nthat Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered\nthat State of Washington concealed this information so that “Democrats” and Republicans could\nlaunder $7o billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through |\nintervenor’s atorneyz.\n\ne On l2/27/l9, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the\nFalse Claims Act, seeking $l billion in damages and qui tam bounty against “Democrats”,\nRepublicans, and his former atorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by Declaration (first 2 pages only)).\n\ne On5/l/l3, USDO! submited a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor’s claim (See EXHIBIT C Case\nl:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration), falsely stating that intervenor’s allegations\n“lack sufficient factual and legal support.”\n\ne oOn5/l3/l9, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Barr and other USDOJ atorneys\nfor conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by Declaration).\n\ne On5/l4/l9, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct.,\nafter fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case l:l9-CR-\noo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration).\n\nDAVID GOLDEN\nl5l5l NW MASON HILL RD\nNORTH PLAINS, OR 97l33\nMOTION TG INTERVENE - 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo634\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000635.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document5l- Filed o8/27/l9 Page 3of4\n® On 5/l5/l9, Intervenor had his petition for quo warranto against USDOJ for fraud/ obstruction/\nperjury dismissed as “moot” (See EXHIBIT F Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by\nDeclaration}.\n© On6/6/l9, intervenor identified the conspiracy (the same conspiracy at work in this case) to the\nDistrict Ct.

Intervenor also indicated that he intended to write about USDOI’s\nunlimited “prosecutorial discretion” to fraudulently dismiss False Claims complaints, as this\n“prosecutorial discretion” was the same “prosecutorial discretion” exercised by USDOJ and Alex\nAcosta in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Intervenor also atached an article by the former Deputy\nAtorney General of the United States (Donald Ayer), indicating that Barr was a “fierce advocate of |\nunchecked presidential pouer”. Intervenor also identified the judge in the District Ct.

In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s leter, dated August l3, 2o2o, responding to Ms. Maxwell’s request that the\nCourt (i) direct the government to disclose the identities of the three alleged victims referenced\nin the indictment, subject to the restrictions of the protective order in this case; and (il) order the\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery\nmaterials (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt. 4l).\n\nWith regard to the issue of alleged victims’ identities, the government concedes, as it\nmust, that this Court has the authority and discretion to order the relief sought, but claims that\nMs. Maxwell’s application should be denied as untimely and without merit. (Gov’t Resp. at 2-\n4). Instead, the government asserts that the appropriate and timely way for Ms. Maxwell to seek\nconfirmation of their identities is through a request for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars, which should be filed\nin December 2o2o. (/d. at 3). The government then notes that it would oppose such a motion,\nwhich it claims should also be denied. (/d.). The government concludes that it will finally\nprovide confirmation of their identities in the 35oo material and a witness list to be provided\nshortly before trial. (/d. at 4).\n\nThe upshot of this is clear: in the government’s view, Ms. Maxwell should not knou the\nidentity of the three witnesses referenced in the indictment until at best just before trial, and\nshould have to spend the next eleven months (or longer) trying to conduct a defense\ninvestigation, in a case in which she is presumed innocent, without having this information.\nThis information is critical to conducting a meaningful defense investigation, given that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 55 Filed o9/o4/2o Page 6 of 9\neee I\nSEaes sep NOS LTR ToFT] |.\nHADDON, MORGAN AND FOREMAN, P. i &\nl5o EAST loTH AVENUE 3\nDENVER CO 8o2o3 in\n7 €\nSHIP TO: e\nCLERK OF COURT _*\nUS DISTRICT COURT - SDNY\n5oo PEARL STREET\nDANIEL P.

Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 3\n(l999); Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974) (“[A]n indictment is sufficient if it,\nfirst, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge\nagainst which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquital or conviction in bar\nof future prosecutions for the same offense.”); Fed.R.Crim.P.7(c). An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings.

Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse PF from\nharassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are\nunprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to\nparticipate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and\npsychological wellbeing.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 27 of 45\n(Ex.

The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)).

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are time-barred even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 amendment to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 amendment to apply\nretroactively. To the contrary, the conference commitee considered and rejected an express\nretroactivity provision in the House version of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>, and one of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>’s original Senate co-\nsponsors acknouledged on the Senate floor that the omission was intentional. Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive application would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an exception to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a child. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 25\nretroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment; it actually considered and rejected such a\nprovision, signaling its clear intent that the amendment not be retroactive. Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). Here, the\nlegislative history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>,\nwhich would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity\nprovision. Child Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. llo4, lo8th Cong. § 2o2 (2oo3) (“The\namendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense commited\nbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section.”). The Senate version contained no\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo266o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 25\nretroactivity provision. PROTECT Act, S. l5l, lo8th Cong. (as engrossed in the Senate, Feb.\n24. 2oo3). When the House and Senate conferenced to resolve differences between the bills, the\nretroactivity provision was omited. As Senator Leahy, one of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>’s original co-sponsors and\na former chair of the Senate Judiciary Commitee, stated on the Senate floor, the omission was\nintentional: “I am pleased that the conference agreed to drop language from the original House-\npassed <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> that would have extended the limitations period retroactively.” Senator Leahy,\nAmber Legislation, Cong. Rec. l49:5o, $5l47 (2oo3).\n\nSuch a clear expression of congressional intent should end the Landgraf analysis at the\nfirst step. In applying Landgraf, the Supreme Court has made clear that the “expressly\nprescribed” analysis is not limited to the text of the statute, but may look to legislative history.\nSee Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history”\nas part of first Landgraf step); see also Latab v. Ashcroft, 384 F. 3d 8, l4 (lst Cir. 2oo4) (‘our\ninquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of\nstatutory construction, such as the statute’s structure and legislative history”). Indeed, Landgraf\nitself included a legislative history analysis. 5ll U.S. at 264. In Landgraf, houever, the Court\nconcluded that the legislative history at issue did not clearly evidence Congress’ intent regarding\nretroactivity. Jd. That is not the case here.\n\nAs Judge Katzmann of the Second Circuit has recognized, unambiguous legislative\nhistory should not be disregarded:\n\nWhen courts construe statutes in ways that respect what legislators consider their\n\nwork product, the judiciary not only is more likely to reach the correct result, but\n\nalso promotes comity with the first branch of government. It is a bipartisan\n\ninstitutional perspective within Congress that courts should consider reliable\n\nlegislative history and that failing to do so impugns Congress’s workways.\n\nRobert A. Katzmann, Judging Statutes (2ol4), at 36. Consideration and rejection by Congress of\na legislative proposal is one of the clearest expressions of congressional intent, and courts\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo266l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 25\ntypically give it great weight in interpreting federal statutes. See, e.g., Food & Drug Admin. v.\nBroun & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. l2o, l44 (2ooo) (noting that “Congress\nconsidered and rejected” federal bills that would have granted the FDA jurisdiction to regulate\ntobacco products); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 464\nUSS. 89, lo4 (l983) (noting that Congress had “expressly considered and ultimately rejected”\nproposed interpretation of Civil Service Reform Act); Hudson Valley Black Press v. LR.S., 4o9\nF.3d lo6, ll2 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (noting that legislative history, including conference report,\n“plainly establishes that Congress expressly considered broader remedies” against IRS for\nretaliatory audits “before rejecting them’); United States v. Napolitano, 76l F.2d l35, l37 (2d\nCir. l985) (“legislative history of the [Speedy Trial] Act clearly indicates that Congress\nconsidered and rejected defendant’s suggestion” that dismissal sanction be applied to certain\nsubsequent charges); United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688, 693 (2d Cir. l982) (characterizing\nconference commitee’s rejection of Senate proposal to permit use of plea bargaining statements\nfor impeachment purposes under Fed. R. Evid. 4lo as “demonstrating Congress’ explicit\nintention to preclude use” of such statements). It cannot reasonably be disputed that Congress\nintended that the 2oo3 Amendment would not apply retroactively.\n\nNothing in Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2ol7), the only Second\nCircuit case that analyzes the retroactivity of the 2oo3 Amendment, is inconsistent with this\nanalysis. In Weingarten, the court’s analysis was in the context of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim. Thus, Weingarten offers litle more than a distraction from the analysis required\nhere: The court was not required to and did not decide the merits of the issue, noting that “[t]he\nunderlying merits question remains for another day, another case.” Jd. at 58. Moreover, the\ndefendant in Weingarten did not raise, and the court did not consider, the argument that Congress\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2662\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002663.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 25\nhad expressly prescribed that the 2oo3 Amendment would not be retroactive; Weingarten\nconsidered only whether there was an express prescription that the 2oo3 Amendment would be\nretroactive, concluding that the defendant’s counsel could have made “colorable” arguments that\nthere was no such prescription. Jd. at 58.°\n\nCongressional intent here could not be clearer. The House <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> would have made the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive, the Senate <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> did not, and the conference consciously rejected the\nretroactivity provision. It is unnecessary to proceed to the second Landgraf step, and Counts\nOne through Four are time-barred.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\n\noffenses would have impermissible effects.\n\nIf the Court were to proceed to the second Landgraf step—whether application of the\n2oo3 Amendment here would have an impermissible retroactive effect—that step also counsels\nagainst retroactivity.\n\nAny analysis of the retroactivity of a criminal statute of limitations under the second step\nof Landgraf must be undertaken in conjunction with the principle that unlike civil statutes of\nlimitation, “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). As one court recognized in\ndeclining to extend a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, if Landgraf and\nToussie “are read in conjunction,” courts “must interpret the statute of limitations in a manner\nfavoring repose for Defendant.” United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7).\n\n* Nor was this clear evidence of congressional intent raised or considered in United States v. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8), which the government cites in support of its contention that the 2oo3\nAmendment may be applied retroactively. Gov. Mem. at 6.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2663\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l6\n(quoting Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)). Thus, whether Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 constituted an overt act in furtherance of the\nalleged conspiracy depends on the scope of the alleged conspiracy.\n\nIn United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), for example, the defendant\nwas charged with conspiracy, and causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election\nCommission, in connection with an alleged scheme to obtain illegal campaign contributions from\nforeign donors. The defendant moved to strike references in the indictment to acts of\nconcealment of the alleged conspiracy. The court expressed concern that “the allegations\nprovide litle detail about the acts” and that “references to the alleged acts of concealment and\ncover-up suggest the inclusion of offenses that are not part of the conspiracy charged in the\nindictment.” /d. at 25. Although the court denied the defendant’s motion to strike, it ordered a\n<span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial agreement and in particular\nwhether and hou the acts of concealment alleged in the indictment were within the scope of the\nconspiracy charged.” /d. at 33. The court added that if the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars confirmed the\ndefendant’s assertion that the alleged acts of concealment and cover-up were not within the\nalleged scope of the conspiratorial agreement, her motion to strike would be granted. /d. at 26.\n\nHere, the object of the alleged conspiracies—necessarily, under the Mann Act—was not\nto cause any individual to engage in unlawful sex acts with Epstein, but to cause individuals to\ntravel to do so. The allegations regarding Accuser-3, even if proven, could not have furthered\nsuch alleged conspiracies.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms.\n\nMaxwell.\n\nThere can be no legitimate dispute that the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are\ninflammatory and unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. The indictment alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3 and that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage Epstein,\n“knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse” Accuser-3. Indictment {ff 7c, lld, l7d. The\nphrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even though the alleged conduct may well have\nbeen lawful: Accuser-3 was at or above the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times,\nand the indictment contains no suggestion that the alleged sexual activity involving Accuser-3\nwas nonconsensual. Regardless of whether the conduct was lawful or unlawful in England,\nhouever, few allegations could be more prejudicial to a defendant than allegations that she\nparticipated in the “sexual abuse” of a teenager. The allegations as to Accuser-3, though\nirrelevant to the government’s conspiracy counts, thus create precisely the prejudicial appearance\nthe government seeks.\n\nBecause the allegations as to Accuser-3 are both irrelevant to the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell and unduly prejudicial, they should be stricken as surplusage.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l47 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neno 5 ee = == -X\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nVv. .\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, NOTICE OF MOTION\nDefendant.\n: ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED\net on on oe == -X\nDEFENDANT GHISLAINE MAXWELL’S NOTICE OF MOTION\nFOR A <span class=\"highlight\">BILL</span> OF PARTICULARS AND PRETRIAL DISCLOSURES\n(Pretrial Motion # lo)\n\nPLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, upon the accompanying memorandum of law and\nexhibits, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through counsel, hereby moves for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars\nand pretrial disclosures.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP\n/s/ Mark S.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n(l963) and impeachment material under Giglio v.

Ms.\nMaxwell has been prevented from knouing even the most fundamental information about the\nallegations against her, which are based on conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago.\nFirst and foremost, the government still has not disclosed the identities of the witnesses who\nhave accused Ms. Maxwell of wrongdoing. Despite requests to the government to disclose that\ncritical information, the government has refused to do so on the grounds that it needed to protect\nthe witness’ privacy, even though some of them, we believe, have publicly identified themselves\n' By leters, emails, and phone calls with government counsel, the parties have atempted to resolve pretrial\ndiscovery requests in advance of filing of pretrial motions. Unresolved requests are the subject of this motion. The\ndefense will continue to atempt to resolve disclosure issues with the government as they arise.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2698\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of 23\nin court conferences, in lawsuits, and in the press. Without this basic information, Ms. Maxwell\ncannot adequately investigate the allegations against her and prepare for trial.\n\nThe voluminous discovery provided by the government, which totals in the millions of\npages—the vast majority of which was produced to the defense in November 2o2o—does not\nshed any more light on the nature of the government proof or the specifics of the alleged\nconduct.” The discovery contains only a handful of documents that even pertain to the time\nperiod charged in the indictment (l994-l997), and what litle exists offers almost no information\nabout the details of, for example, exactly when and where the alleged incidents of sexual abuse\ntook place, who was allegedly present, and hou the alleged conduct violated the law. Without\nthese details, which Ms. Maxwell is requesting through a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars, she cannot identify\nrelevant witnesses or documents that she may wish to obtain to prepare her defense.\n\nIt is clear that the detail about hou these alleged offenses took place will come solely\nfrom the statements of the government’s witnesses. Accordingly, it is critical that Ms. Maxwell\nreceive Jencks Act material and the government’s witness list, as well as 4o4(b) evidence, well\nin advance of trial so that she can conduct an adequate investigation. The unique circumstances\nof this case more than warrant early disclosure of this material. The conduct alleged in the\nindictment dates back 25 years, making investigation and preparation of the case complex and\ndifficult. The global COVID-l9 pandemic adds further complications and obstacles to trial\npreparation. The Court has recognized that Ms. Maxwell should be granted ample time to\nreview documents related to witnesses in this case. (See Dkt. 73 (ordering the government to\nproduce documents related to certain non-testifying witnesses by March l2, 2o2l “to ensure that\n* Ms. Maxwell is still reviewing the discovery, including the over two million pages produced in November 2o2o.\nIn deference to the Court’s schedule and in light of the trial date, we have not asked the Court to further extend the\ndeadline to file pretrial motions. Houever, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to supplement these motions at a later\ndate if her review of discovery uncovers documents that warrant additional requests.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2699\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 23\nthe defense can adequately prepare for trial”)). For the very same reasons, the Jencks Act and\n4o4(b) evidence should be produced to the defense no later than March l2, 2o2l.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should grant Ms. Maxwell’s request for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>\nof particulars and her other requests for pretrial disclosures.\nI. Motion for a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court direct the government to file a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars,\npursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, because the Superseding\nIndictment does not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Counts One\nthrough Four of the indictment make vague and unspecified allegations that Ms. Maxwell\npurportedly enticed and caused unidentified individuals to travel to engage in illegal sex acts\nover a four-year period. But they provide no specifics about when these events supposedly took\nplace or what constituted the alleged illegal sex acts. Indeed, it is nou almost seven months\nsince Ms. Maxwell was arrested and the government s/i// has not even disclosed the identities of\nthe three accusers that form the core of the government’s case against her in Counts One through\nFour. Nor has the government alleged why Ms. Maxwell’s supposedly perjurious responses to\nthe deposition questions set forth in Counts Five and Six were material to the defamation\nproceeding in which they arose. Ms. Maxwell cannot hope to investigate these allegations and\nadequately prepare for trial with such limited information. A <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is therefore\nwarranted.\n\nRule 7(f) permits a defendant to seek a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars “in order to identify with\nsufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant\nto prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574\n(2d Cir. l987). The decision of whether to grant a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is within the discretion of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\nthe district court. /d. “In deciding whether a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is needed, the court must\ndetermine whether the information sought has been provided elsewhere, such as in other items\nprovided by discovery, responses made to requests for particulars, prior proceedings, and the\nindictment itself.” United States v. Strawberry, 892 F. Supp. 5l9, 526 (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her case has already been significantly impaired by not\nknouing the most basic information about the government’s proof — she still does not knou who\nhas accused her of these alleged crimes. Without knouing this fundamental information, Ms.\nMaxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and atempt to investigate\nthese allegations blindly. If one of the purposes of a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is to “prevent surprise,”\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574, there could be no greater “surprise” than for Ms. Maxwell to find\nout that a few weeks before trial that the people she assumed to be the three accusers were not, in\nfact, the right people. If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work\nand will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nAs we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here. See\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975);° United States v. Warme, No.\nO9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose\nidentity of sex crime victim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against\nthis charge is significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim’). On August 25, 2o2o, the Court denied as premature our request that the government be\nordered to provide the identities of the three accusers. (Dkt. 49). We have conferred with the\n>In Cannone, the Second Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s order to compel disclosure of\nwitness identities under the circumstances of that case. 528 F.2d at 3oo-o2. Nevertheless, Cannone recognized the\ndistrict courts’ ability to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses in appropriate cases. /d at 3ol.\nHere, the unique circumstances of this case warrant the disclosure of the accusers’ identities.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\ngovernment, but have not been able to agree on a disclosure schedule and therefore renew this\nrequest as part of this motion for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s efforts to prepare for trial have also been significantly impaired by the\nlack of specificity in the indictment. In Bortnovsky, the Second Circuit reversed the defendants’\nconvictions for failure to grant a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars, primarily because the indictment failed to\nidentify relevant dates. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574-75. The Circuit concluded that the\ndefendants, accused of submiting false burglary claims for insurance purposes, “were hindered\nin preparing their defense by the district court’s failure to compel the Government to reveal\ncrucial information: the dates of the fake burglaries and the identity of the three fraudulent\ndocuments.” /d. at 574. Asa result, Bortnovsky held, “[t]he relevance of key events was\nshrouded in mystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial.” Jd. at 575.\n\nMs. Maxwell is similarly hindered. The indictment charges Ms. Maxwell with enticing\nor arranging travel for an unidentified individual, Accuser-l,* from Florida to New York at some\npoint during a four-year period. Yet the government has not alleged the dates of Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged interactions with Accuser-l, the dates when Accuser-l allegedly traveled across state\nlines for the purpose of engaging in sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein, the dates on which\nMs. Maxwell allegedly enticed the complainant to do so, and the actions Ms. Maxwell allegedly\ntook to entice Accuser-l to travel. Ms. Maxwell has requested precisely such particulars from\nthe government, and the government has declined to provide them.\n\nThis information also has not been provided in discovery. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment’s representation that accuser testimony is corroborated by “flight records, diary\nentries, business records, and other evidence,” (Dkt. 4 at 5), the government has not produced\nany such records from which it could be ascertained when or hou Ms. Maxwell is alleged to\n* The indictment identifies the three accusers as Minor Victims l-3. We will refer to them as Accusers l-3.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 23\ngovernment should be required, at a minimum, to remove this shroud of mystery and file a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of\nparticulars to permit Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense and avoid unfair surprise at trial.\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574. Accordingly, we request the particulars set forth in Exhibit A. (See\nEx. A).\n\nII. Motion for Disclosure and Inspection of Documents\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks an order directing the government to produce certain material\nbelieved to be in the possession of the government or its agents, or which could be obtained by\nthe government from other prosecutor’s offices, law enforcement officers and investigators,\nwitnesses, or persons having knouledge of the events giving rise to this case. Ms. Maxwell\nrequested these documents from the government, but was denied. As discussed further belou,\nMs. Maxwell has good reason to believe that some of these documents contain exculpatory\nBrady material; hence, the government has a duty to produce them to the defense, and should be\nordered to do so immediately. The alternative means of obtaining the requested documents\nwould be through subpoenas served on the government and unidentified witnesses, which is an\nimpractical pursuit. The government would likely move to quash any subpoena, requiring court\nintervention; and it would be impossible to serve subpoenas on witnesses without knouing their\nnames and locations. We therefore request that the Court direct the government to produce the\ndocuments set forth belou.\n\nA.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United\nStates Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by\nthe Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Specifically,\nthe defendant points to an earlier version of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>, which contained an express retroactivity\nprovision that was not included in the final version of the statute. (Def. Mot. 2 at 6-7). The\ndefendant’s argument on this point is both misleading and unpersuasive. The defendant quotes\nSenator Patrick Leahy’s comments on the 2oo3 conference commitee report to the effect that “the\nconference agreed to drop language from the original House-passed <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> that would have extended\nthe limitations period retroactively.” (Def. Mot. 2 at 7). This is a selective quotation; the full\nstatement regarding retroactivity is as follous:\n\nA final point on section 2o2: I am pleased that the conference agreed\n\nto drop language from the original House-passed <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> that would\n\nhave extended the limitations period retroactively. That language,\n\nwhich would have revived the government’s authority to prosecute\n\ncrimes that were previously time-barred, is of doubtful\n\nconstitutionality. We are already pushing the constitutional\n\nenvelope with respect to several of the “virtual porn” provisions in\n\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>. I am pleased that we are not doing so in section 2o2 as\n\nwell.\nl49 Cong. Rec. $5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (emphasis added). As\nthe full quotation makes clear, the legislative history does not support the conclusion that when\nCongress amended Section 3283, it declined to adopt the language in the House-passed <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>\nbecause it wanted the lengthened statute of limitations to apply only prospectively. Instead,\nSenator Leahy’s comments indicate that Congress declined to add language that would allou for\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (2ol6 indictment covering conduct going back\nto l998); United State v. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 622 (E.D. Va. 2ol9) (2ol9 indictment for\nconduct in 2ooo). Indeed, that is precisely what Congress authorized when it extended the statute\nof limitations for such crimes through the lifetime of the victim.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo299l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 239\nthe resurrection of time-barred prosecutions, in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.'4 But that\nconcern is entirely separate from extending the statute of limitations for live claims, which is what\nCongress did here. Critically—and as discussed in greater detail belou—there is no Ex Post Facto\nClause issue in this case, because the statute of limitations for Counts One through Four had not\nyet expired when the limitations period was extended in 2oo3.\"\n\nAccepting the defendant’s argument would undermine Congress’s plain purpose in\nextending the limitations period. In l99o, 2oo3, and 2oo6, Congress extended—and ultimately\nabolished—the statute of limitations to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex\nabuse victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay. Applying the 2oo3 statute\nonly prospectively subverts that purpose by exempting all past offenders. According to the\n‘4 Moreover, the fact that Congress considered, but ultimately omited, retroactivity language does\nnot end the Landgraf inquiry, as the defendant suggests. Indeed, Landgraf itself makes this clear.\nIn that case, the statute at issue had a predecessor, which contained a retroactivity provision. That\nversion was vetoed by the President, and the final version of the statute omited the retroactivity\nprovision. As the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he omission of the elaborate retroactivity\nprovision of the l99o <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>—which was by no means the only source of political controversy over\nthat legislation—is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was\nstruck in the l99l Act.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256. Indeed, “[i]t [was] entirely possible—indeed,\nhighly probable—that, because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of\nthe l99o legislation, Congress viewed the mater as an open issue to be resolved by the courts.”\nTd. at 26l.\n\n'S Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 were both younger than 25 in 2oo3, when Congress\nextended the limitations period. Minor Victim-3 was not, but this does not alter the inquiry,\nbecause the Indictment does not contain any counts that relate to Minor Victim-3 alone. Instead,\nshe is one of multiple victims of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. The inclusion\nof the overt acts relating to Minor Victim-3 in an otherwise timely conspiracy count does not\nrender that count untimely. To the contrary, for conspiracy counts, the Government is only\nrequired to prove that one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred within the limitations\nperiod. United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2ool). Thus, the defendant is incorrect\nto assert that the government is “barred” from prosecuting the defendant for any offense against\nMinor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 2 at lo, n.3). Instead, there is no statute of limitations issue here so\nlong as the jury is properly instructed at trial that it must find at least one overt act within the\nlimitations period—i.e., one overt act that does not relate to Minor Victim-3.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 239\nAccordingly, overt acts that may, on their oun, be untimely can nevertheless serve as direct\nevidence of the existence of a charged conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v. Marcus, 628 F.3d 36, 43 (2d Cir. 2olo) (declining to vacate\na conviction on a statute with only prospective application when “the Government presented post-\nenactment evidence sufficient to satisfy the elements” in addition to evidence of relevant pre-\nenactment conduct). Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia. See id. at 33.

Specifically, the Indictment\nmakes plain that the defendant is charged with engaging in a conspiracy to transport minor girls\nwith intent that they engage in sexual activity with Epstein, engaging in a conspiracy to entice\n\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003140.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 239\nminor girls to travel with the intent that they engage in sexual activity with Epstein, aiding and\nabeting the transportation and enticement of a particular minor girl interstate for the purpose of\nengaging in sex acts with Epstein, and lying about those same crimes during her 2ol6 civil\ndeposition testimony. The charged time periods are made plain in each count, as is the statute she\nis accused of violating.\n\nThe speaking Indictment in this case goes above and beyond a mere recitation of the\nelements of each offense by detailing the defendant’s specific role in the crimes charged. Among\nother things, it specifies three minor victims in particular and describes the steps the defendant\ntook with respect to each as part of the charged crimes. See, e.g., Indictment 4/7. Additionally,\nthe Indictment details the types of sex acts that Epstein commited with the minor victims as part\nof the charged crimes and the locations where those acts occurred. See, e.g., id. § 5-6. In this way,\nthe Indictment makes clear the Government’s theory that the defendant groomed three minor girls\nto engage in sex acts in Florida, New Mexico, New York, and London with Epstein between l994\nand l997. The Indictment further specifies during which portion of that period each of those three\nvictims interacted with the defendant and Epstein as minors. See id. §7. Additionally, the\nIndictment identifies the precise answers that the Government alleges constituted perjury, and\nalleges facts, in the earlier portions of the Indictment, that indicate hou and why the Government\nwill seek to prove the answers were false. Compare id. JJ 2l, 23 with id. 9§ l-ll.

Thus, the Indictment itself provides a sufficient\nbasis to deny the defendant’s motion in its entirety. See, e.g., United States v. Bonventre, 646 F\nApp’x 73, 79 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (“‘[E]videntiary detail is not the function of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars.’\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 239\nParticulars are necessary only where indictment charges are ‘so general that they do not advise the\ndefendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” (internal citation omited) (quoting Torres,\n9ol F.2d at 234; United States v.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®® Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA.

Even if the\ninquiry proceeds to step two, houever, the government has failed to adequately rebut Ms.\nMaxwell’s shouing that application of the 2oo3 Amendment here would have impermissible\nretroactive effects.\n\nA. Step One: Congress Did Not Expressly Prescribe Retroactivity and Rejected\n\na Proposal to Do So.\nl. Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision ends the\ninquiry at step one in Ms. Maxwell’s favor.\n\n“TW |here the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). As Ms.\nMaxwell’s opening memorandum demonstrated, congressional intent with respect to the\nretroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment is clear: the House version of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> included\nan express retroactivity provision, the Senate version contained no retroactivity provision, and, in\nthe words of one of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span>’s co-sponsors, the House-Senate conference “agreed to drop\nlanguage from the original House-passed <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> that would have extended the limitations period\nretroactively.” Senator Leahy, Amber Legislation, Cong. Rec. l49:5o, $5l47 (2oo3). The Court\nneed look no further. Such an unambiguous expression of congressional intent establishes\nconclusively that the 2oo3 Amendment is not retroactive.\n\nThe government argues that Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision is not\nprobative, because according to Senator Leahy’s floor statement, the decision was grounded in\nconcerms about the revival of time-barred charges rather than the extension of live charges, and at\nleast some of the charges here were live at the time of the 2oo3 Amendment. But to the extent\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9of22\n\nthat Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,’\nCongress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision\naltogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “‘inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment.

In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\npermits a defendant to seek a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v.

Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3.

See Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at lo9 (explaining\nthat Rule l7(c) is not appropriate for evidence that is “otherwise procurable” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). BSF represents that “all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater.” (3/22/2l Leter from BSF, Dkt. No.\nl9l at 5). The Government also obtained and produced seven pages of the diary to the defendant\nin discovery. (Mot. for a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures, Dkt. No. l48 at lo).\n\nThe defendant argues that the entire diary is exculpatory because it contains no reference\nto her. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). But the Government and Minor Victim-2\nhave acknouledged the absence of references to the defendant from the start, and Minor Victim-2\nis expected to testify to that fact at trial. (See Gov’t Omnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87 (citing\nMem. in Opp. to Def.’s Renewed Motion for Release, Dkt. No. loo at ll n.2.); 3/22/2l Leter from\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5). The defendant earlier moved to compel the Government to obtain and\nproduce the diary to her, a motion the Court has denied. (Opinion & Order, Dkt. No. 2o7 at 29).\nAs the Government explained in its opposition to that motion, the Government understands that\nMinor Victim-2 stopped writing in her diary shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, so there are no\nentries regarding her later trip with Epstein, during which she met the defendant. (See Gov’t\nOmnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87). The victim provided the Government with her entries\nrelating to Epstein, which the Government in turn produced to the defense. (/d.).

Feb. 6, l989) (reaching the unremarkable result that an “undercover agent’s diary” is\n“not discoverable in and of itself” except “to the extent that this diary contains” Brady material).\n\nAlternatively, the defendant states that she needs to inspect the “entire journal” to\n“establish whether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoilation has\noccurred.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). “This examination,” she continues,\n“requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner.” (/d.) This argument lacks\nmerit. The defendant’s bare assertion that authenticity might somehou be in doubt is hardly a\nsufficiently detailed explanation of relevance and admissibility to justify a subpoena for a minor\nvictim’s personal journal. The defendant does not identify any basis for doubting the authenticity\nof the documents, which the Government expects that Minor Victim-2 will be able to properly\nauthenticate at trial. Nor does the defendant identify what kind of examiner she intends to use,\nwhat kind of examination will occur, or hou that examination might bear on the journal’s\nauthenticity. See Wey, 252 F.

The government’s opposition\n(“Opp.”) does not address these justifications, or atempts to deflect them, and does nothing to\nundercut Ms. Maxwell’s arguments in support of the requested relief.\n\nIndeed, the new revelations in the government’s opposition highlight the need for the\nrelief she seeks. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion to Strike Surplusage from the Indictment,\nthe government’s opposition discloses for the first time that Accuser-3' will testify that she\nalleged y\neee\nES l:5: :tcz2:ions, which\nmeaningfully expand the scope of the charges against Ms. Maxwell, are not mentioned anywhere\nin the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”), nor are they alluded to in the over 2.7 million\npages of discovery. Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly investigate the allegations to prepare her\ndefense if she does not knou fundamental information about when and where the alleged\nincidents of sexual abuse took place. Nor can she make appropriate motions to preclude the\ngovernment’s use of this evidence, as it falls outside of the scope of the charged conspiracies.\nMoreover, the government continues to refuse to provide Ms. Maxwell the most basic piece of\ninformation she needs to prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo423l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page5ofl6\nher of the crimes charged in the Indictment. A <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is therefore necessary to\nprevent unfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nIt is also critical that Ms. Maxwell receive accelerated disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list, Jencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-\nconspirator statements. The government predictably argues that there is nothing unusual about\nthe circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a deviation from customary\nproduction deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique circumstances that warrant the relief she seeks. The Indictment alleges\nvague conduct that is over 25 years old and involves conduct that allegedly took place over a\nfour-year period in multiple locations across the country and in at least one foreign jurisdiction.\nAny relevant documents that may still exist will take time to retrieve. The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\nproduction of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\nproduction and inspection of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the discovery. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73). Because the Court granted Ms. Maxwell’s request to extend the filing\ndeadline for the reply motions by lo days from March 5, 2o2l to March l5, 2o2l, we have moved forward our\nrequested deadline for the production of witness materials by lo days to March 22, 2o2l.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page6ofl6\nl. The Court Should Grant a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars.\n\nA <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is appropriate if the indictment does not disclose to the defendant\nwith sufficient particularity “the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling\ndefendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy\nshould he be prosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987). Here, the revelation of new allegations from Accuser-3 disclosed\nfor the first time in the government’s opposition, as well as the government’s continuing refusal\nto identify the names of the three accusers, justify the need for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars to prevent\nunfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nFirst, as it has done since the beginning of this case, the government continues to deny\nMs. Maxwell the most basic piece of information she needs to investigate the allegations against\nher and prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused her of the crimes\ncharged in the Indictment. Rather than atempt to justify withholding this information out of\nconcer for the accusers’ safety or privacy—an untenable argument, given that two of the three\naccusers, if we are correct about their identities, have already publicly identified themselves—the\ngovernment instead argues that because it has provided enough information for Ms. Maxwell to\nguess who they are, there is no need to disclose their names at this point. (Opp. l8l-82). Ms.\nMaxwell should not have to rely on guesswork to prepare for trial, especially when the testimony\nof these three accusers will comprise the core of the government’s proof. With trial only four\nmonths away, Ms. Maxwell’s need to have sufficient time to investigate the allegations against\nher vastly outweighs any countervailing interest the accusers may have in remaining anonymous.\nIf the government is unwilling to provide the names of the accusers, the Court should order the\ngovernment to do so either as part of a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars or pursuant to its inherent authority to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl6\nThese new allegations—which expand the nature and scope of the charged\nconspiracies—are exactly the type of “surprise” revelations that a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is designed\nto protect against. The Indictment makes no mention of these allegations, nor is there any\ninformation in the discovery indicating that they would be part of the government’s case. The\ngovernment therefore cannot argue, as it does in its opposition, that the information provided in\nthe Indictment and the discovery produced to date are sufficient for Ms. Maxwell to understand\nthe nature of the charges against her, especially when only a small fraction of the discovery\npertains to the time period charged in the Indictment. (Opp. l79-8l). “The Government [does]\nnot fulfill its obligation merely by providing mountains of documents to defense counsel” if the\ndiscovery does not identify the alleged criminal conduct.” Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575; see also\nUnited States v.

(Dkt. l48 at l4-l5). In response,\nthe government does not atempt to rebut Ms. Maxwell’s justifications for accelerated disclosure\nof these materials.

The\ndefense’s request for yet earlier disclosure is unfounded and reflects a significant—and\nunwarranted—departure from the practices in this District.\n\nConsistent with the Government’s previously stated position (Dkt. No. 2o4 at l92), it is\nentirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of any co-conspirator statements through\nJencks Act materials and marked exhibits. This is because the Government only intends to\nintroduce co-conspirator statements either through the testimony of witnesses, which will be\npreviewed in the Jencks Act material, or in the exhibits, which will be marked before trial. As the\nGovernment has previously noted, the Second Circuit has rejected the notion that non-exculpatory\nco-conspirator statements are discoverable by Rule l6 or by any other means other than the Jencks\nAct. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing\nDistrict Court’s order directing the Government “to produce all oral statements made by the\ndefendants and coconspirators that the Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a\ndefendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol). The cases cited by the defense all involved orders granting\nbills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all alleged coconspirators. They\ndid not involve orders directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the Government\nmay introduce at trial. Indeed, the Government is unaware of any case in which such particularized\nnotice distinct from the production of Jencks Act and marked exhibits has been ordered, and the\ndefense cites none. This Court has already denied the defendant’s motion for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars\nfor Counts One through Four (see Dkt.

For the\nreasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court to:\n\nl. Dismiss Counts One, Three, Five and Six for breach of the Non-Prosecution\n\nAgreement;\n\n2. Dismiss Counts Five and Six for violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause;\n\n3. Dismiss Counts Five and Six as time-barred under the statute of limitations;\n\n4.

Order a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars as to Counts Five and Six;\n\n7. Order the government to produce Accuser-4’s prior statements as Brady material.\n\nThe S2 Superseding Indictment (“S2 Indictment”) demonstrates just hou far the\ngovernment is willing to go to “get” Ms. Maxwell and disingenuously blame her for the crimes\nof Jeffrey Epstein. No longer content to charge a 25-year-old case based on purported conduct in\nthe l99os, the government nou sweeps in the 2ooos through the allegations of one person—\nAccuser-4.' But Accuser-4 is not a new witness; she first levied her accusations more than a\ndecade ago. The Palm Beach FBI and the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) interviewed Accuser-4 in or around 2oo7 during their three-\nyear investigation of Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse (the “Florida Investigation”). And\nremarkably, although interviewed just a few years after she claims any misconduct occurred,\nAccuser-4 never implicated Ms. Maxwell. Instead, she reported [is\n\" Accuser-4 is identified in the S2 Indictment as Minor Victim-4.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo427o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 26 of 32\nincorporated into the broader Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. (/d. J\nl-9, ll-l3, l6-l9). For the same reasons discussed in her prior motion, the Court should dismiss\nCount Five and either Count One or Count Three as multiplicitous.\n\nVv. The Court Should Dismiss the S2 Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should also dismiss the S2 indictment due to the government’s excessive and\nprejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution against Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due\nprocess rights. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss the\nSl Indictment due to the excessive pre-indictment delay in charging her with those offenses.\n(Dkt. l38, 2o9). The S2 Indictment only compounds these issues by charging additional\noffenses based on alleged conduct that the government has knoun about since in or about 2oo7,\nwhich it added for tactical reasons to shore up its case against Ms. Maxwell. For the same\nreasons discussed in her prior motion, the Court should dismiss the $2 Indictment. The Court\ndenied Ms. Maxwell’s initial motion on these grounds, but preserved Ms. Maxwell’s ability to\nrenew her motion after trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8). Accordingly, we request that the Court defer\nconsideration of this motion until trial.\n\nVI. The Court Should Order a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars as to Counts Five and Six.\n\nThe Court should also order the government to file a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars pursuant to Rule\n7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because Counts Five and Six of the $2\nIndictment do not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Rule 7(f)\npermits a defendant to seek a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars “in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v.

The counts do not specify, houever, the dates that any of this\nalleged conduct occurred. For example, the S2 Indictment does not specify when Ms. Maxwell\n“interacted” with Accuser-4 or allegedly “recruited” her “to engage in sex acts with Epstein” or\n“enticed” her “to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts with Epstein.” (S2 Indictment J\n9d, 25a, 25b). Nor does the S2 Indictment specify when Ms. Maxwell allegedly paid Accuser-4\nor sent her gifts or called her to schedule massage appointments. (Id. ff 9d, 25c, 25d). A <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of\nParticulars for Counts Five and Six is therefore necessary and appropriate.

(See Section II\nsupra). In order “to interpose [her] plea of double jeopardy,” Ms. Maxwell must confirm what is\napparent from the grand jury testimony of Special Agen i — that the offenses charged\nin Counts Five and Six are the same offenses that were presented to the SDFL grand jury.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons and the reasons already discussed in our previous motion\nfor a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars, the Court should order the government to file a <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars\nidentifying the follouing information related to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment:\n\n(l) The dates when Ms. Maxwell allegedly met and/or interacted with\n\nAccuser-4.

(Ud.\n\n4 9d).\n(4) The dates when Ms. Maxwell allegedly was “present” when [Accuser-4]\n\n“was nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence.” (/d. ¥ 9d).\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4292\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l35 of 349\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®’ Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l8 of 349\n<span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure.*“4\n\nB.

Seventh, the defendant’s request for immediate disclosure of impeachment\nmaterial regarding one of the Government’s witnesses should be denied consistent with this\nCourt’s prior conclusion that such material may be provided closer to trial.\nARGUMENT\nI. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court concluded, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this conclusion, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the similarity\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already concluded that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 26\nVI. A <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Particulars Is Not Warranted\n\nThe defendant again seeks a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars, this time related to Counts Five and Six of\nthe S2 Indictment. Because the Government has provided the defendant with more than sufficient\ninformation—through both the S2 Indictment and discovery—to understand the charges against\nher, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy, this motion should be denied.\nThe instant motion seeks essentially the same type of details that the defendant sought with regards\nto Counts One through Four in her prior motions. For the same reasons that the Court denied that\nprior motion, this motion should also be denied. (See Apr. Op. at l9).\n\nThe proper purpose of a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f)\nis “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is\nnecessary to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” United States\nv. Torres, 9ol F.2d 2o5, 234 (2d Cir. l99o), abrogated on other grounds by United States v.\nMarcus, 628 F.3d 36, 4l (2d Cir. 2olo) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omited).\nAccordingly, “[a] <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars is required ‘only where the charges of the indictment are so\ngeneral that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” United\nStates v. Walsh, l94 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. l999) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234); see United\nStates v. Mahabub, No. l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2ol4).\n\nAs was the case with the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained\nin Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,\nwhich provides significant detail. As is apparent from the 23-page speaking S2 Indictment, Counts\nFive and Six concern the defendant’s participation in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nminors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abeting of, the sex trafficking of a\nparticular minor identified as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately 2ool through\n2oo4.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 22 of 26\n\nThe S2 Indictment identifies Minor Victim-4 as a victim of the conspiracy charged in\nCount Five and the trafficking offense contained in Count Six. See, e.g., S2 Indictment 4 9(d),\n25, 27. Further, the S2 Indictment provides extensive detail regarding hou the sex trafficking\nscheme operated. See, e.g., id. §§ 6-7. In particular, the S2 Indictment explains that the defendant\nor another of Epstein’s employees would: call a minor victim to schedule an appointment to\nmassage Epstein; greet the minor victim at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence and escort her into a\nmassage room, where Epstein would then engage in sex acts with the victim; and pay the minor\nvictim hundreds of dollars in cash after the massage. See id. 7. The S2 Indictment specifies the\ntypes of sex acts involved in this conduct, see id. { 7(b), and further identifies the particular role\nthat the defendant played in facilitating the trafficking of Minor Victim-4, see id. § 9(d). Among\nother things, the S2 Indictment describes conversations the defendant had with Minor Victim-4\nand further explains that the defendant called Minor Victim-4 to schedule massage appointments,\npaid Minor Victim-4 after completing massages, sent Minor Victim-4 gifts from New York to\nFlorida, and encouraged Minor Victim-4 to bring other young females to massage Epstein. See id.\n\nGiven all of these details, the S2 Indictment alone provides a sufficient basis to deny the\ndefendant’s motion in its entirety. See, e.g., United States v. Bonventre, 646 F. App’x 73, 79 (2d\nCir. 2ol6) (“‘[E]videntiary detail is not the function of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars.’ Particulars are\nnecessary only where indictment charges are ‘so general that they do not advise the defendant of\nthe specific acts of which he is accused.’” (internal citation omited) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at\n234; United States v.

The discovery gives the defense\nample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to\nunderstand who Minor Victim-4 is from the productions, (see, e.g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),\nthere is no real concern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before\nreceiving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on a\nsimilar issue in this case, the motion for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars should be denied.\n\nVII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,\nWhich Do Not Warrant Immediate Disclosure\n\nThe defendant moves for the immediate disclosure of any prior inconsistent statement\nmade by Minor Victim-4. In other words, the defense seeks immediate production of impeachment\nmaterial for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has already noted in prior\nbriefing, it is aware of its disclosure obligations and intends to produce Giglio material for all of\nits witnesses, including Minor Victim-4, at least six weeks in advance of trial. Consistent with the\npractice in this District, the Court has previously concluded that such time is sufficient for the\ndefense to prepare for trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 3o).\n\nThe Government agrees that any prior statement in which Minor Victim-4 discussed her\ninteractions with Epstein, but omited mention of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense\nin advance of trial. Contrary to the defense’s assertion, houever, such prior statements are classic\nimpeachment material that need only be produced sufficiently in advance of trial to permit the\ndefense adequate time to make use of them. See United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44, l46\n7 Although Minor Victim-4’s identity is clear from the discovery, and the defendant’s motion\nmakes clear that she strongly suspects Minor Victim-4’s identity, there is no basis at this time to\nrequire the Government to turn over the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in\nadvance of its Jencks Act production, which is customary in this District.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo473l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o9 _ Filed o7/ol/2l Page2of3\nHonorable Alison J.

Defense counsel did not respond.\n\nMost recently, on June 3o, 2o2l, Mr. Markus authored an Op-Ed in the New York Daily\nNews.? The Op-Ed compared the defendant to <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Cosby and argued that this case should be\ndismissed in the wake of Mr. Cosby’s release from prison. The Op-Ed claims that Jeffrey Epstein’s\nnon-prosecution agreement is binding in this District, but that “[t]he trial court, just like the trial\ncourt and intermediate appellate court in Cosby’s case, has agreed to let the government out of its\ndeal.” The Op-Ed further claims that this case is “extremely weak” and asserts that “[a] jury should\nreject those flimsy and stale charges.” The Op-Ed also identifies Mr. Markus as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” Other news outlets have subsequently issued articles regarding the Op-Ed.*\n\nB. Relief Is Warranted Under Local Rule 23.l\n\nLocal Rule 23.l generally prohibits extrajudicial statements of opinion that a reasonable\nperson would expect to create “‘a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with\na fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(a).\nThe Rule further provides, in relevant part, that statements of “opinion as to the accused’s guilt or\ninnocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the case” are among those that\n“presumptively involve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with\na fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(d)(7).\nThe Rule applies to all statements made by lawyers “in connection with pending or imminent\ncriminal litigation with which they are associated.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(a). Furthermore, the\nRule provides that the Court “may issue a special order governing such maters as extrajudicial\nstatements by parties and witnesses likely to interfere with the rights of the accused to a fair trial\nby an impartial jury ....” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(h).\n\nMr. Markus is plainly governed by Local Rule 23.l, because he is not only “associated”\nwith this criminal case, but he is also counsel of record in the defendant’s appeals in connection\nwith this mater. Mr. Markus’s comments to the media—most egregiously, the Op-Ed—were\nclearly in violation of Local Rule 23.l. Not only did his statements directly comment on the merits\nof this case, but they did so in a manner designed to appeal directly to the pool of potential jurors\n2 See Ben Feuerherd, Feds Detail Ghislaine Maxwell’s ‘Enhanced Security Schedule’ In Prison, N.Y.

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous.”\n\nRobert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, 3l AM. INST. CRIM. L. &\n\nCRIMINOLOGY 3, 3 (l94o). In fact, the prosecutor is afforded such great\n\ndeference that this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nseldom interfere with a prosecutor’s charging decision. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 693 (l974) (noting that “the Executive\n\nBranch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6o of 8o\ntraditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that defines\nthe community’s sense of fair play and decency.” Commonwealth v. Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page2ofl4\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six on the grounds that prosecuting her on\nthose counts would violate her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.

Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA.

In that footnote, the Court noted that the defendant’s motion for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars\nincluded a request that the Government identify her unnamed co-conspirators, as did her position\nin the parties’ joint leter regarding the disclosure schedule. The Court wrote that, because the\nGovernment had not objected, it “presumes the Government intends to disclose this information\nto Maxwell at the same time that . . . it discloses Jencks Act material.” (/d. at l2 n.l).

There is accordingly no significant risk that the defense will\nbe surprised at trial by a profusion of co-conspirators and their statements, even if the Government\nidentifies statements for use at trial from additional co-conspirators.\n\nIn any event, there is no basis to require the Government to provide a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars\ncontaining an exhaustive list of unnamed co-conspirators.

(Dkt. No. 2o7 at l9-2l; Dkt. No. 3l7 at ll-l2). The same analysis\napplies to the defendant’s request that the Government identify her unnamed co-conspirators. See\nUnited States v. Murgio, 2o9 F.

The S2 Indictment already contains “more details than those strictly required.” (Dkt.\nNo. 2o7 at 2o (discussing the Sl Indictment)). The Government has provided the defendant with\nextensive discovery that she has largely had in her possession for months, and it will provide\ninvolved orders granting bills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all\nalleged coconspirators,” and the Government had separately opposed the defense supplemental\nmotion for a <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> of particulars.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion.

The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator.... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly\nhigh — released rapists are lo times more likely to repeat their crime than other\ncriminals.

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the community because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison. See USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (“This guideline is\nintended to provide lengthy incarceration for offenders who commit sex offenses against minors\nand who present a continuing danger to the public.” (emphasis added); see also United States v.\nBroxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 285 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We further note that this guideline [$4Bl.5] is\nintended to identify ‘repeat sex offenders,’ who pose ‘a continuing danger to the public.’” (citing\nUSSG § 4Bl.5 cmt. background)).

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees.

Ms. Pomerantz\n\nl Epstein's sexual abuse evolved over the course of a decade.\n\n2 You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of\n\n3 mentoring young girls, of promising them scholarships and\n\n4 opportunity, to introduce massage, inviting them on trips and\n\na transporting them across state lines, and that you will learn\n\n6 that they used these so called massages as a way to sexually\n\n7 abuse the victims.\n\n8 During that earlier phase, the defendant and Epstein\n\n9 had to find each girl individually themselves, but by the early\nlo 2ooos, the defendant and Epstein found an easier way to\n\nll maintain a continuous flou of girls to abuse. They were no\n\nl2 longer finding girls through the cover of scholarships and\n\nl3 opportunity. Instead, they devised a pyramid scheme of abuse,\nl4 a scheme that no longer required the defendant to personally\n\nl5 find young girls for Epstein.\n\nl6 So what did the defendant and Epstein do? They\n\nl7 encouraged girls to bring other girls. They asked the girls if\nl8 they had any young friends to bring over. And when a girl\n\nl9 brought someone new, she was rewarded with cash, extra cash on\n2o top of the hundreds of dollars she got for giving Epstein a\n2l sexualized massage. The defendant and Epstein handed hundred\n22 dollar bills to poor teenage girls in exchange for them giving\n23 Epstein so called massages. To be clear, those girls were not\n24 professional masseuses — they were kids being sexually\n25 exploited and abused.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 94 of 246 2389\nLCGVMAX3 Sud -— direct\n\nl Q.

Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse from\nharassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are\nunprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to\nparticipate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and\npsychological wellbeing.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020041.jpg": "Casesb:2o-O8oo88oHAGN ISSoUMENT D2 FileG6RA3o/PtagPage af726fo45\n(Ex.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United\nStates Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by\nthe Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been\nappointed by courts to oversee financial maters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same\nhourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and\nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House <span class=\"highlight\">bill</span> only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment.

Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3.

Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA.

Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021308.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel36 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”!®8 Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021391.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Page2l9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Rights in the VRRA.?° Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure.”\nB.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“green light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023146.tif": "federal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”!®8 Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023181.tif": "narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at... hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jomned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023229.tif": "<span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> of Rights in the VRRA.?® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure. 74\nB.

The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned.

According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlorida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npatern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of l7, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.}\nBrunel is a 5o-plus French playboy who was formerly part ouner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency.

Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hiting\nlawyers—Alan Dershouitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among\nthem—toc escape equal justice?\nMichael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to\nthe transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims’ civil suits, in which he explained hou the case against Epstein\nwas minimized by the State Atorney's Office, then bargained doun by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an\natmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several\ncolleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2oo9 and nou runs his oun security firm, objected both to Epstein’s plea\nagreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the\ndeposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered “yes.”\nIn March 2o65, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a l4-year-old girl, launched an\ninvestigation that would eventually uncover a patern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning\nseveral continents, knouingly enabled by Epstein’s associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever\nEpstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl woutd be brought to the mansion on El Brillo Way. (“The younger the\nbeter,” he instructed Haley Robson, a focal teenager whe was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who\ndeclared, on a police tape, that she was “like a Heidi Fleiss,” the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would\nbe giving a “massage,” the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and\nsometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $2oo or more, depending on hou far things\nwent, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,ooo cash on hand.\nThe Palm Beach Potice Department identified l7 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent;\nthe youngest was l4, and many were younger than l6. And that was just at one of Epstein’s many hames around the\nworld—he also ouns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by\nihe FBI, reaching as far back as 2ool, indentified roughly 4o victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein\nreferred to as his “Yugoslavian sex slave” because he had imported her from the Balkans at age l4.

The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.

Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in December, when\nhe was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner.\nit is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has atended as Epstein’s guest.\nA lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was a\nquest at a cocktail party throun by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models. ‘Some\nguests were horrified,’ said the article’s author, Vicky Ward.\nIt should not be forgoten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his sentence\nfor offences relating to child prostitution.\nHouever, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one\n\n| reading The Mail on Sunday's interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can be\n\n| in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges.\n\n| Epstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton and Donald Trump among his\n\n| friends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2oo5 after the stepmother of a l4-year old\n\n| girl claimed she was paid $2oo (£l25) to give him an ‘erotic massage’.\n\n| The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 2o girls levelling sexual allegations against him.\n\n: Eventually, Epstein struck a ‘plea bargain’ with prosecutors — a practice not permited under British law —\nunder which he was alloued to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.\n\n. o3956-l274\nhtp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie... 3/l6/2oll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029056.tif": "| _ Prince Andrew and girl, l7, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Mail On...

The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter. :\nVirginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people.

The\nwestern most gate was in the closed position. The front was\nlecked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west\nwhere there is a small double gate which has a sign, “Please keep\ngate closed\". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with\na swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk\nway leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra\ncoastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any\nsigns of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have\nleft either debris such food containers, cigaretes, cigars etc. None\nwas found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was\n79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small\ncabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer\nequipment ae well as exercise equipment. None of this had been\ntouched or tampered with.\nOn the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.\nEpstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the\nintruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer\nroom and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass\nwindous present. The eastern most and western most are\nidentical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has\n\\ three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of\nl4 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a\nwood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was\nfound ajar, houever the sandy area directly outside of the door did\nnot indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The\ncentral windou was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism\nin the extended outward position. The two windous believed to\nhave been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were\nfound on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the\neastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a\nfingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a\nxubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central\nwindou.\nOnce inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is\na veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The\nblack bag is approximately 2' long by l' high and was placed on\nthe southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The\nindividual knelt doun and pulled the case open and removed cash\nfrom a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar\nbills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen\none hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.\nMelnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned\ndirectly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the\ndesk, sides of the desk and botom of the desk was processed for\nlatent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found\non those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters\nand processed chemically for latent fingerprints.

To the west of the swimming pool is a walk\nway leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra\ncoastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any\nsigns of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have\nleft either debris such food containers, cigaretes, cigars etc. None\nwas found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was\n79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent.

None of this had been\ntouched or tampered with.\nOn the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.\nEpstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the\nintruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer\nroom and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass\nwindous present. The eastern most and western most are\nidentical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has\n( three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of\nl4 flagstones leading directly into the room.

And even to doubt an expert’s\nstatements.”\nEpstein has been a munificent supporter of cuting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early\nbiotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“Tt was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a litle food out, lovely hors d’ oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall I say\n\n| this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it7” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\n<span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say ‘What’s\ngoing on here?” and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling are of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter bad been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary -admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe schoo] with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and Jotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhi 28ieaw vrinthis clickahility cam /nt/ent?aieeSF oft D2 tlo=The+t Panta iPulie Reberds Reqdest N6./l7-295°°\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031413.jpg": "Date: 9/ol/o6 FALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 3\nTime: l3:38:o6 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nl-o3-ool498 (Continued)\n| City/State/Zip : PALM BEACH, FL oooo3348o\nPhone Number . : 2l2/75o-9895\nkteaxtkkeek O T HE R PERSON INFORMATION - # l #FkRKKKEHE\nCase Number . : l-o3-ool498 Last Name . . : ALESSI, MARIE\nStreet Number : l5l5 SO FLAGLER DR. #l9ol\nCity... . . + WEST PALM BEACH, FL 334o7\nBirth Date/Age : lo/27/l946 56 Employer? ..:\nOccupation . .: Oper Lic No. . :\nHome Phone No. : 56l/ooo-oooo Race ..., .-. : White\nBex .« « « « ?

Alessi, DOB o2/l2/5o, Living at\nl5l5 South Flagler Dr., Apt. l9ol, West Palm Beach, Florida.\nI advised Epstein that I would need to obtain a copy of the\nsurveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to\nhave in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working\nknouledge of the system but he would contact the company who\n_....__had_installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday.\nEpstein told me he would call when he had more information. ===\nEpstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told\nme that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry\ninto the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side\ncf the house but not the west side of house because he had\npersonally locked all the sliders on that side of the house.\nIt is believed that the suspect also left the house by the\nsame sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks\nor indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also shoued\nme the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm\nhandgun between the books which was nou missing. Epstein could\nnot supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this\ntime but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee\nBivd. to obtain the information.\nCrime Scene Manager Greg Parkinson processed the crime scene and\ncollected the envelope that the money had been taken out of.\no7/26/l7 Page 2l of ll Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l43l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031433.jpg": "Date: 9/ol/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: ta. :\n| Time: l3:38:o6 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\n| Soe ee el er a ee a Se ee een eee eee\n\nl-o3-ool498 (Continued)\n\n| he lives at 358 El Brillo.

And even to doubt an expert’s\n| statements.”\nEpstein has been a munificent supporter of cuting-edge research. Axe! met Epstein during the early\nbiotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“It was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a Jitle food out, lovely hors d’oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall T say\nthis? —by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it?” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\n<span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he becarne a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old-—-old-fashioned, unrebabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say “What’s\ngoing on here?’ and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling arc of Epstein’s comet came to an end—vwithout his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary-admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe school with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl lefi school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came m,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhtn-/Awww nrinthis clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acton=cnt &title=The+Fantasist&exnire=acurl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 24 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032070.jpg": "————————— a . .

Burns was allegedly dating\nEpstein at the time. Burns and Eaton had once cohabitated together\nwhen they modeled. Eaton explained Burns called her on her telephone\nand advised her that she was in Palm Beach and requested to see her.\nEaton made arrangements to meet with her at Epstein's house. Eaton\narrived and met Epstein and Burns. Burns and Eaton went to the Palm\nBeach Mall together and went shopping. Eaton advised that Burns and\nshe had received money from Epstein to go to the mall. They visited\nVictoria's Secret and purchased undergarments from the store utilizing\nmonies given by Epstein. Eaton advised she purchased one item and\nBurns purchase various items. The money used to purchase the items\nwas the money given by Epstein.\nBurns and Eaton continued shopping and having a day together. Eaton\nstated Burns explained hou she and Epstein have been dating each other\nand he has been paying all of her bills. Eaton claimed Burns advised\nthey met in New York and had been dating ever since. They later\nreturned to Epstein's home and encountered Epstein. He had a brief\nconversation with Eaton about her modeling career. He knew of her\nmodeling career from Burns. He requested to see her modeling\nportfolio and explained that he could help her with modeling jobs.\nEaton had her book with her to shou Burns and shoued the book to\nEpstein. He commented negatively about her photographs and portfolio.\n| Eaton felt uncomfortable with the comments made as she had been\nworking with other professional modeling companies who had offered her\nwork from her photographs. Epstein requested to see what was\npurchased at the mall. Burns took out the undergarments which were\npurchased. She immediately shoued Epstein different sets purchased.\nEpstein then requested to view what Eaton purchased. Eaton was\nreluctant to shou the outfit houever since it was Epstein's money that\npurchased the item, she pulled it out of the bag. Epstein asked her\nto try it on. Eaton looked at Burns who told her \"yeah, try it on.\"\nFeeling compelled to try the undergarment outfit on; she went to\nanother room and put on the bra and panty set. She walked out to the\nliving room where they were siting, and modeled the suit. She then\nwent back into the other room and changed back into her clothes.\nEaton returned into the room and told Burns she would be going home.\nBurns scheduled another day for Eaton to return for massages with her.\nEaton stated within that same week, she returned to meet with Burns\nand have a massage. Burns had told her that she would be unable to\nstay with her as she would be going on a bike ride with Epstein.\nBurns explained she could stay at the house and take advantage of the\nmassage.\no7/26/l7 Page 26ol Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo329l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032928.jpg": ",\nDTG OPERATIONS dba DOLLAR RENT A CAR VEH.#: 8l7622-l\n24ol Turnage Boulevard LIC. #: W28GIS STALLA: l2/23/2oo5 lo4o HHll5484-5\nWest Palm Beach, FL ooooo33 o5 NISSAN SENTRA\n866-434-2226 Rate: WALK Cls: CDAR 92oool TIME OUT TIME IN\nFUEL LEVEL OUT: FULL ll/26/2oo5 lo48\nMILEAGE OUT: ll23o **RENTAL RATES** EST CHG\nHours l2.oo/ mls\nCUSTOMER DECLINES LDW AND IS RESPON- Days 24.99/ mls\nSIBLE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE PER TERMS Weeks l24.95/ mls 499.8o\nOF THE RENTAL AGREEMENT.

The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President <span class=\"highlight\">Bill</span> Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033231.tif": "Generosity to Employees and Others. While it might be commonplace to say that\na particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly\nreflects this fact on both financial and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is\nquick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally\nthose who work for him and those he knous. Once he learns of and determines through\nconversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,\ntreats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees\nto it that, without strings atached, the solution happens. The issues may be\naccommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family\nproblems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to beter\nhimself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to\naddress the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this\ncapacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.\n\nExamples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.\nIndyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:\n\n. Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the\nworkman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-\nin-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen\nof Colombia and the workman did net have the financial resources or\nknou hou to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey\narranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law\nand sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit\nto the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients\nrecovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.\nEpstein’s expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the\nhigh school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education\nis nou being funded by Mr. Epstein.\n\nThere have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for\nemployees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several\nexamples follou:\n\nA father of one of Jeffrey’s employees in the Virgin Islands was recently\ndiagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for\nthe father’s treatment and has given the employee financial support and\ncomplete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order\nto fly to Florida to atend to the employee’s father.\n\n: ll\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033234.tif": "different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as financial,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,\nto meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas\nadoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters. Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but\nhas been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,\neducational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,\n\nand civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them\nl4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33234\n"};
