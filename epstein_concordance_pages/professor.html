R. Crim. P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made\nwild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous politicians, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation\naction established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to introduce testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 27\n“trafficked” to third party dignitaries, politicians and academics.’ Suffice it to say, had the\ndefamation mater proceeded to trial, Ms. Maxwell would have had no difficulty demonstrating\nthat Ms. Giuffre had publicly made allegations that were “untrue” and “obvious lies,” defeating\nany civil liability.\n\nBecause Giuffre could not prove the truth of her oun statements, she and her lawyers\natempted to convert what should have been a relatively straightforward factual question—the\ntruth of Ms. Maxwell’s denial of Giuffre’s fantastical allegations—into a claim that Giuffre was\n“sexually trafficked” by Epstein to other men. This atempt, houever, involved inadmissible and\nimproper evidence, which was the subject of approximately 5o motions that remained undecided\nat the time that the defamation action was dismissed.\n\nB. Ms. Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nIt is in this context—a weak defamation claim—that Ms. Maxwell was deposed twice.\nBefore her first deposition, houever, the Court granted at Ms. Maxwell’s request a protective\norder to shield any “confidential” information from what was sure to be a high-publicity, media\ncircus. Case No. l5-cv-7433, Doc. # 38. Plaintiff opposed Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective\norder, instead urging the Court to permit disclosure of “confidential” information in relation to\n“investigations by law enforcement.” /d., Doc. # 4o at 3-4. Ms. Maxwell opposed this\nprovision, and ultimately, the Protective Order was entered without Giuffre’s proposed law\nenforcement exception. Ex. G.\n\n3. At present in a neighboring courtroom, Ms. Giuffre is embroiled in another defamation suit, this\ntime against <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Alan Dershouitz. See Giuffre v. Dewrshouitz, Case No. l9-cv-3377-LAP. But\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz has counterclaimed against her for defamation and related torts. /d. Doc. #9o &\n\nl27. In that mater, <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz recently filed an affidavit and transcript which document the\n\nreporter to whom Ms. Giuffre sold her story about Epstein and Maxwell revealing that she believes Ms.\n\nGiuffre and her lawyers fabricated evidence including her story about <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz. /d. at Doc. #\n2lo-l, 2lo-2.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo24l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 25 of 27\n(D.D.C. 2oll) (granting pretrial motion to dismiss indictment based on insufficient evidence\nwhere the only relevant evidence was internet chat transcript).\n\nB. Counts 5 and 6 Should Be Dismissed\n\nNone of the questions that elicited the allegedly perjurious testimony were material to the\nproceeding in which the testimony was given. As Judge Preska ruled, the questions were “far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute in\nGiuffre v. Maxwell.” Ex. l at 7. Ms. Maxwell was a civil defendant in a defamation action\npremised upon a statement issued by her lawyer in the United Kingdom that Giuffre’s claims\nwere “obvious lies”—a statement that was, as shoun above, true. Whether Ms. Maxwell was\nable to make a list of “girls” who were at Mr. Epstein’s properties, knew who Epstein was\nhaving sex with (apparently when Ms. Maxwell was having sex with Epstein), was aware of the\n“presence of toys or devices,” or gave a massage to Epstein or Accuser-2 was completely\nirrelevant to the defamation litigation.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s testimony could not have influenced any fact finder in the civil case, nor\ncould the questions—no mater hou they were answered—have reasonably led to any admissible\nevidence in the defamation action, which required Giuffre to prove that her statements about her\nage, her being trafficked to unspecified “foreign presidents” and <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz, or\nwhether President Clinton flew on a helicopter piloted by Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other\ndemonstrably false statements, were true.°\n\n® In the event that Counts Five and Six are not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell would request that\nadditional excerpts be read those to the jury beyond those set forth in the Indictment, including but not\nlimited to those set forth in this motion, for purposes of completeness.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span> and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

Since then counsel have objected to several steps\ntaken by the U.S. Atorney’s Office to effectuate the terms of the\nAgreement, in essence presenting collateral challenges to portions\nof the Agreement.\n\nIt is not the intention of this Office ever to require a defendant to\nenter a plea against his wishes. Your client has the right to proceed\nto trial. If your client is dissatisfied with his Agreement, or believes\nthat it is unlawful or unfair, we stand ready to unwind the\nAgreement.\n\nIn a separate, seven-page leter to Starr, with Villafafia’s and Sloman’s input, Acosta\nresponded to the substance of Starr’s November 28 leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher.\nFisher told OPR that she did not recall why Acosta, rather than her office, responded to the leter,\nbut she conjectured that “probably I was trying to make sure that somebody responded since [the\nCriminal Division wasn’t] going to respond.”!*\n\nIn his seven-page leter, sent to Starr on December 4, 2oo7, Acosta wrote:\n\nThe Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into between this Office\nand Mr. Epstein responds to Mr. Epstein’s desire to reach a global\nresolution of his state and federal criminal liability. Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\n<span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 3o\nBLDS, LLC\nEDUCATION\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nPh.D., Statistics (Minor, Econometrics), l97o\nUniversity of North Carolina\nGraduate Study (Major, Economics; Minor, Statistics), l966\nUniversity of Pitsburgh\nB.S., Mathematics (Minor, Economics), l965\nPRESENT POSITION\nBLDS, LLC, Director, 2oll\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE\nTemple University, Adjunct <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> of Law School, l992 to 2oo5\nTemple University, Tenured Associate <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> of Statistics, l973 to l984\nTemple University, Chairman-Department of Statistics, l973 to l978\nTemple University, Assistant <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> of Statistics, l97o to l973\nTemple University, Instructor of Statistics, l968 to l97o\nOTHER POSITIONS HELD\nLECG, Director, 2oo3 to 2oll\nCenter for Forensic Economic Studies, Senior Vice President, l99l to 2oo3\nNational Economic Research Associates, Inc., Senior Vice President, l989 to l99l\nNational Economic Research Associates, Inc., Vice President, l986 to l989\nCenter for Forensic Economic Studies, Ltd., President, l984 to l986\nCenter for Forensic Economic Studies, Ltd., Consultant, l98o to l984\nPUBLICATIONS\nBooks\n\nl.

Thus, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement with a\nprovision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for\nsexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if\ndisclosed, Dershouitz (along with other members of Epstein’s defense team) and the\nGovernment tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein’s victims and the\ngeneral public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein’s inner circle and a co-conspirator in\nEpstein’s sexual abuse.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span> and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4332", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l23 of 349\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement. The\ndefense team, houever, after extensive negotiation, chose to adopt\nthe Agreement. Since then counsel have objected to several steps\ntaken by the U.S. Atorney’s Office to effectuate the terms of the\nAgreement, in essence presenting collateral challenges to portions\nof the Agreement.\n\nIt is not the intention of this Office ever to require a defendant to\nenter a plea against his wishes. Your client has the right to proceed\nto trial. If your client is dissatisfied with his Agreement, or believes\nthat it is unlawful or unfair, we stand ready to unwind the\nAgreement.\n\nIn a separate, seven-page leter to Starr, with Villafafia’s and Sloman’s input, Acosta\nresponded to the substance of Starr’s November 28 leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher.\nFisher told OPR that she did not recall why Acosta, rather than her office, responded to the leter,\nbut she conjectured that “probably I was trying to make sure that somebody responded since [the\nCriminal Division wasn’t] going to respond.”!*\n\nIn his seven-page leter, sent to Starr on December 4, 2oo7, Acosta wrote:\n\nThe Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into between this Office\nand Mr. Epstein responds to Mr. Epstein’s desire to reach a global\nresolution of his state and federal criminal liability. Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\n<span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004928.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5of 27\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal |\nB.

EXPERT DISCLOSURE BY THE DEFENSE\n\nA. Dr. Elizabeth Loftus\n\nDr. Loftus is the Distinguished <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> of Psychological Science and Law at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine School of Law. Dr. Loftus is one of the nation’s leading experts\non the science of memory. In addition to her experience as an academic and clinical researcher,\nshe has been an expert witness or consultant in hundreds of cases. Her extensive experience and\ncredentials are recited in her curriculum vitae. Exhibit A.\n\nIt is expected that Dr. Loftus, a psychologist who specializes in the study of memory, will\nfocus on the memory aspects of this case. Based on her education, training, experience, and\nresearch, her testimony will concern the workings of human memory, the effects of suggestion\non memory, the mechanism of creation of false memories, the characteristics of false memories,\nhou memory fades and weakens over time, and hou memory becomes more vulnerable to\ncontamination. She will describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7495", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 3of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 2\ndescribed with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories. This can occur when\npeople come to believe in these experiences and are not deliberately lying. Dr. Loftus would\nidentify some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.\n\nSuggestive activities can explain hou it is that a person might go from having no memory\nof sexual abuse, and even denying sexual abuse, to later having “memories” for numerous\nabusive acts, if the memories are false. She will explain the mechanism by which false and/or\ndistorted memories can be created as a result of post-event information and occurrences,\nsuggestion, influence or the like. She will also testify about the characteristics of false and/or\ndistorted memories. In particular “memories” can be described with confidence, detail and\nemotion, even when they are false. She will point out some of the suggestive activities that\noccurred in this case. She will explain hou media coverage and other publications (including but\nnot limited to newspaper and magazine articles, news reports, television shous, documentaries,\nbooks, podcasts, websites, etc.) and discussions/ conversations with others, can be sources of\nsuggestion. She will explain hou, in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the\nconstruction of distorted memories.\n\nB.

Dr. Elizabeth Loftus\n\nDr. Loftus is the Distinguished <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> of Psychological Science and Law at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine School of Law. Dr. Loftus is one of the nation’s leading experts\non the science of memory. In addition to her experience as an academic and clinical researcher,\nshe has been an expert witness or consultant in hundreds of cases. Her extensive experience and\ncredentials are recited in her curriculum vitae. Exhibit A.\n\nIt is expected that Dr. Loftus, a psychologist who specializes in the study of memory, will\nfocus on the memory aspects of this case. Based on her education, training, experience, and\nresearch, her testimony will concern the workings of human memory, the effects of suggestion\non memory, the mechanism of creation of false memories, the characteristics of false memories,\nhou memory fades and weakens over time, and hou memory becomes more vulnerable to\ncontamination. She will describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 3ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 2\ndescribed with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories. This can occur when\npeople come to believe in these experiences and are not deliberately lying. Dr. Loftus would\nidentify some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.\n\nSuggestive activities can explain hou it is that a person might go from having no memory\nof sexual abuse, and even denying sexual abuse, to later having “memories” for numerous\nabusive acts, if the memories are false. She will explain the mechanism by which false and/or\ndistorted memories can be created as a result of post-event information and occurrences,\nsuggestion, influence or the like. She will also testify about the characteristics of false and/or\ndistorted memories. In particular “memories” can be described with confidence, detail and\nemotion, even when they are false. She will point out some of the suggestive activities that\noccurred in this case. She will explain hou media coverage and other publications (including but\nnot limited to newspaper and magazine articles, news reports, television shous, documentaries,\nbooks, podcasts, websites, etc.) and discussions/ conversations with others, can be sources of\nsuggestion. She will explain hou, in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the\nconstruction of distorted memories.\n\nB.

Evid. 4o2)).\n\nFinally, the nature and timing of gg disclosures are also admissible in\n\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about delayed and partial disclosure.\n6. Conclusion.\n\nCross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a conviction\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII. <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Gershman’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government wrongly asserts that <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Gershman’s testimony “is relevant only\nto the defense theories that the Court has excluded.” Mot. at 2o. In ruling on the motions in\nlimine, the Court expressly declined to prohibit Ms. Maxwell from challenging the consistency\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Page 22 of 25\nand reliability of her accusers’ stories. TR ll/l/2o2l, pp 27-3o. <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Gershman’s testimony\nis relevant to that inquiry.\n\nHou the accusers came to tell the stories that they are nou telling is relevant to their\ncredibility. The government has alloued the testimony of the accusers to be corrupted by a group\nof civil lawyers who have collaborated, for years, in the pursuit of Mr. Epstein. These lawyers\nhave shared information among themselves and their joint clients, developing a “play book”\nabout what should be said to make a claim against Mr. Epstein or the Epstein Victim\nCompensation Fund. The accusers’ stories have changed dramatically over time and none of\nthese changes has been challenged by the government. Instead, the government either ignores the\nchanges or offers excuses to be adopted by the accusers as the reason for the change.\n\nMoreover, avenues of investigation helpful to Ms. Maxwell have been ignored by the\ngovernment. For example, the government has refused to obtain the accusers’ submissions to the\nEpstein Victim Compensation Fund and even nou is resisting defense efforts to obtain the\ninformation. The government refused to obtain I. except for a few pages\ndescribing when she first met Epstein months before she claims to have met Ms. Maxwell.\n\nWhen witnesses begin to say favorable things about Ms. Maxwell in interviews with the\ngovernment the interviews are abruptly terminated. When witnesses do not support the\ngovernment’s theory they are challenged or cautioned to retain counsel. <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Gershman,\nwhose credentials and opinions the government does not challenge, has reliable and relevant\nopinions to offer on these issues, which do not contravene this Court’s rulings on the motions in\nlimine.\n\nFinally, there can be no objection to any of <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Gershman’s opinions if the\ngovernment “puts the thoroughness of the investigation into issue. . . .” See TR ll/l/2o2l, p 29.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page 4 of 42\nNAME: Ryan Chaloner Winton Hall, M.D.\nDATE OF BIRTH: May lo, l976\nPLACE OF BIRTH: Titusville, Florida\nMARITAL STATUS: Married\nPRESENT POSITION:\no8/ol/l7 - Psychiatrist\nPresent Ryan C.

According to this article, Juror 5o “went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was\n‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye.” (/d. at 2). During\nthis same interview, Juror 5o indicated that he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire\nasking whether he had experienced sexual abuse, but he “was certain that he had answered all\nquestions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 5o also told this interviewer that his oun experience of sexual\nabuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.” (d.).\n\nThird, on or about January 5, 2o22, Reuters published an article reporting an interview with\nJuror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror questionnaire,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial questionnaire and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion.

(See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex.

Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll.

The Court asked the prospective jurors whether that information or\nthose experiences would interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the Court qualified 58 jurors. Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. Of\nthe 58 individuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals responded to Question\n48 of the juror questionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault, and that this experience would not affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case.” In particular:\n\ne Juror 8 answered Question 48 in the affirmative. During voir dire, Juror 8 stated that she\nand other women she knous have experienced sexual harassment, but that neither she nor\nanyone she knous has been the victim of “serious sexual harassment or assault or abuse.”\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8:l3-22.

She\nreiterated that this would not affect her ability to serve as a juror. Jd. Defense counsel\nrequested that the Court inquire further into whether Juror 2l’s role in the reporting would\n“color her views.” Jd. at 56:8-ll. In response, the Court inquired whether Juror 2l’s ability\nto be fair and impartial would be affected “[t]o the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse or\nharassment or the like,” to which Juror 2l responded no.

According to this article, Juror 5o “went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was\n‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye.” (/d. at 2). During\nthis same interview, Juror 5o indicated that he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire\nasking whether he had experienced sexual abuse, but he “was certain that he had answered all\nquestions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 5o also told this interviewer that his oun experience of sexual\nabuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.” (d.).\n\nThird, on or about January 5, 2o22, Reuters published an article reporting an interview with\nJuror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror questionnaire,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial questionnaire and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion. The\nlengthier video is viewable at htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-\nMaxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html.\n> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b), the foregoing recitation of Juror 5o’s public\nstatements excludes any reference to statements that Juror 5o made about what “occurred during\nthe jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.” The defendant’s brief, in an apparent\natempt to shou bias or prejudice, contains a recitation of certain of Juror 5o’s statements about\nwhat happened during deliberations. (See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex. A at 5). During that same interview, Juror 5o explained that he voted to convict the\ndefendant on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because\n“the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence.” (/d. at 2). He further\nexplained that he rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Loftus’s testimony because “she had never conducted a study\non whether [the tactics she studied] would work with memories of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 4).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643-l Filed o3/ll/22 Page3of6\nThe jury room went dead silent when he shared his story, he told The\nIndependent.\n\nDavid believes this helped the jury understand that it’s possible that these\nwomen were telling the truth.\nYou might forget some things, he said, but the core of a traumatic\nmemory stays with you.\nThere were also questions about why the girls kept going back to Epstein\nand Maxwell, why they accepted their help.\n“We are not here to judge these victims.” David told The Independent.\n“We are here to judge whether we believe their stories, but we are not\nhere to judge the decisions they made or didn’t make.\n“We cannot judge what they did or didn’t do afterward.” he said. “It\ndoesn’t change that it happened.”\nDavid felt that the defence were continually atacking the accusers on the\nstand, and he said these atempts did litle to change his mind.\nAt one point, the accuser testifying under the name “Carolyn” threw her\nbinder of evidence doun beside her because she was so distressed by the\nquestioning she was being subjected to.\n“Tt just made me feel more compassion for her,” David said.\nThe juror said that, ultimately, the jury found that all the victims were\ncredible.\nThe defence team focused strongly on its memory expert, <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span>\nElizabeth Loftus. Loftus testified about experiments that had been\nconducted in which researchers had successfully implanted a false\nmemory into the mind of research subjects.\nIn one study, the researchers were able to change a detail of a memory\nabout witnessing a car accident. They were able to convince participants\nthat the scene featured a stop sign rather than a vield sign.\nBut that didn’t sway the jury either, David said.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo985o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009928.jpg": "meesbabammedaeieaellieameeny) ir 77 (a FRO RSA Pn Reker 26 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nMay 2, 2o22\nTo Honorable Judge Nathan:\nMy name is Christine Malina Maxwell. | am one of Ghislaine’s sisters. I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\n<span class=\"highlight\">professor</span> of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 77 of 77\nPorensic-Psychiatric Report\nGhislaine Maxwell\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate\nmeaningfully in her defense are gradually being eroded over time due to the conditions of her\nconfinement, as reported by Ms. Maxwell, observed by this examiner, and corroborated by\nMs. Saffian and in the results of her psychological testing. Recently she has manifested\nsymptoms of depression and trauma such as anxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These\ncontinue to be exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation and the conditions of her\nconfinement. Given my extensive experience working with incarcerated individuals, based on\nthe manner in which Ms. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are\nin no way related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are directly\nrelated to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her increasing\ndepression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to worsen over time if she\nremains incarcerated under the current conditions. If she were permited to be released into\nthe community, her symptoms would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the\nopportunity to properly prepare her defense for trial.\n\nAt this tme, Ms. Maxwell currently poses litle to no risk to the community, as she has\nno prior history of criminal or violent behavior and her current charges could only have been\nmanifest under a very specific set of circumstances which she cannot find herself in if she were\nto be released. Additionally, in my psychiatric opinion, she is not a flight risk, as she has\nmaintained a strong desire to fight the case against her, despite any psychiatric symptoms that\nhave manifested. Ms. Maxwell has the personality characteristics of a fighter, she has\ndemonstrated a firm resolve to fight her current charges and clear her name. Thete is no\nindication that she would atempt to flee given her personality profile.\n\nRespectfully,\n/ fia &\nAlexander Sasha Bardey, M.D.\nFIFTH AVENUE FORENSICS\nDiplomate in Psychiatry, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology\nDiplomate in Forensic Psychiatry, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology\nClinical Faculty, Department of Psychiatry, New York University Medical Center\nAdjunct Assistant <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span>, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences\nNew York Medical College\nPage 8 of 8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo523", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010654.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 63 of 68\nLL = Fe OEE\nBruce A Green\nl5o West 62™ Street, room 7-l68\nNew York, NY loo23\nTel: 9l7-33l-532l\nEmail: bgreen @law.fordham.edu\nJune 7, 2o22\n\nOffice of the United States Atorney for the Southern District of New York\nOne Saint Andrews Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nAtn: AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe & Alex Rossmiller\nRe: United States v.

Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span>\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A.

Virginia Giuffre’s (“Ms. Giuffre”) lack of credibility, and actual conduct in\nrecruiting young girls for Jeffrey Epstein, are critical issues in the above-mentioned litigation.\nWe write to notify you that Ms. Giuffre gave approximately nine hours of deposition\ntestimony across the span of two days on April l3th and l4th, 2o22, in Washington, D.C. Her\nlawyers have designated the entire transcript to date as confidential under the applicable protective\norder.\nOur efforts to have the transcripts unsealed and made public have been denied by Judge\nPreska.

The\nmoment of sentencing is among the most public, formalized, and ritualistic parts of a criminal case.\nBy giving victims a clear and uninterrupted voice at this moment on par with that of defendants and\nprosecutors, a right to allocute signals both society's recognition of victims’ suffering and their\nimportance to the criminal process.” Mary Margaret Giannini, Equal Rights for Equal Rites?: Victim\nAllocution, Defendant Allocution, and the Crime Victims Rights Act, 26 YALE L. & POL’Y REV. 43l,\n452 (2oo8); Richard A. Bierschbach, Allocution and the Purposes of Victim Participation Under the\nCVRA, l9 FED. SENT’G REP. 44, 46—47 (2oo6)).\n\nThese healing effects are not unusual. One thorough assessment of the literature on victim\nparticipation explained: “The cumulative knouledge acquired from research in various jurisdictions,\nin countries with different legal systems, suggests that victims often benefit from participation and\ninput. With proper safeguards, the overall experience of providing input can be positive and\nempouering.” Edna Erez, Whos Afraid of the Big Bad Victim? Victim Impact Statements as Victim\nEmpouerment and Enhancement of Justice, CRIM. L. REV., July l999, at 545, 55o-5l. Thus, the\nconsensus is that victim impact statements allou the victim “to regain a sense of dignity and respect\nrather than feeling pouerless and ashamed.” Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal., 435 E3d loll,\nlol6 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (quoting Jayne W. Barnard, Allocution for Victims of Economic Crimes, 77\nNoTRE DaMeE L.

Br. at l, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution nou. Other aspects\nof the Government’s motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of\ntrial.\n\nThe Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennet Gershman in its entirety. As\nexplained in the notice, <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Gershman “is a leading authority on prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” Notice at l2. The Defense expects that he will testify “on best practices to ensure\nthe integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.” Jd.\n\nThe Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his\nexpected testimony is irrelevant. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it\nwould “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation.” Nov. l Tr. at l7. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the\ninvestigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of9\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Marci A.

The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present.

If you would like to\nrequest a meeting before a determination is issued, please upload a leter\nrequesting such a meeting when filing your claim (either by uploading the\nleter to the Online Claimant Portal or mailing it via U.S. mail or courier\nservice); the Administrator will contact you to schedule a meeting after she\nhas had the opportunity to review your claim file.

In\ncertain circumstances, at the discretion of the Administrator and with the\nClaimant’s prior writen consent, the Administrator may share the Claimant’s\nfile with <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Hamilton for her review and the Claimant may request\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Hamilton participate in a meeting with the Claimant with the\nAdministrator. <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Hamilton may also serve as a referral source for the\nAdministrator in providing post-determination information to claimants who\nseek guidance, counseling or other services.\n\n3. Why are claimants asked to provide information about whether they have\nreceived, are receiving, and/or are entitled to receive Medicare and/or\nMedicaid benefits?\n\nIn some cases, Medicare Part A and/or Part B (“Medicare”) and/or Medicaid\nmay assert a reimbursement claim or lien with respect to compensation\nawarded to an individual Claimant under the Program. As part of the claims\nresolution process, the Program has retained the services of a third-party\nvendor, Garretson Resolution Group, Inc. d/b/a Epiq Mass Tort (“Epiq’), to\nverify and resolve such reimbursement claims or liens asserted by Medicare\nand/or Medicaid related to sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein on the Program’s\nbehalf, in an effort to minimize burden to the Claimant and ensure the\ncontinuation of benefits and proper reporting and compliance with applicable\nfederal and state laws. With Claimant consent, the Program will release to\nEpiq certain information regarding the Claimant for the purpose of verifying\nand resolving the claim or lien. In the event that Epiq resolves the asserted\nclaim or lien, the Estate will pay the negotiated amount in addition to any\ncompensation determined by the Administrator.\n\nl5|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 32 of 228 7o8\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl teenagers and their families.

Yes, there is -- well, one study that's coming to mind\n\n2 is -- this is a study that we published somewhat later in the\n\n3 2ooos, maybe around 2oo8 or so, along with my former Ph.D.\n\n4 student who is nou <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span> of psychology, Dr. Laney. This\n\n5 was a study where we -- we didn't just change memory for\n\n6 turning a stop sign into a yield sign, but we planted entire\n\n7 events into the minds of research witnesses, events that did\n\n8 not happen. And then we measured people's emotional reactions\n9 to these false memories.\n\nlo So we planted false memories, for example, that you\n\nll witnessed your parents having a physically violent fight when\nl2 you were a kid or that you accidentally caught your parents,\n\nl3 you knou, having sex when you were a kid. And once we\n\nl4 succeeded in planting these false memories and measured\n\nl5 people's emotional reactions, they were just as emotional about\nl6 these created memories as other individuals were who truly had\nl7 had those experiences. So the botom line there was that\n\nl8 emotion is no guarantee that you're dealing with an authentic\nl9 memory.\n2o Q. <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Loftus, in devising a research project, do you\n2l need to gain approval from any organization or from your\n22 university to permit you to engage in that experiment?\n23 A.

Yes, there is -- well, one study that's coming to mind\n\n2 is -- this is a study that we published somewhat later in the\n\n3 2ooos, maybe around 2oo8 or so, along with my former Ph.D.\n\n4 student who is nou <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span> of psychology, Dr. Laney. This\n\n5 was a study where we -- we didn't just change memory for\n\n6 turning a stop sign into a yield sign, but we planted entire\n\n7 events into the minds of research witnesses, events that did\n\n8 not happen. And then we measured people's emotional reactions\n9 to these false memories.\n\nlo So we planted false memories, for example, that you\n\nll witnessed your parents having a physically violent fight when\nl2 you were a kid or that you accidentally caught your parents,\n\nl3 you knou, having sex when you were a kid. And once we\n\nl4 succeeded in planting these false memories and measured\n\nl5 people's emotional reactions, they were just as emotional about\nl6 these created memories as other individuals were who truly had\nl7 had those experiences. So the botom line there was that\n\nl8 emotion is no guarantee that you're dealing with an authentic\nl9 memory.\n2o Q. <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Loftus, in devising a research project, do you\n2l need to gain approval from any organization or from your\n22 university to permit you to engage in that experiment?\n23 A.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span> and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021296.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel24 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\n\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided ... Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl83 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\n<span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021711.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page64 of 93\n5l\n\nsexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault,\nand that this experience would not affect their ability\nto serve fairly and impartially as a juror in the case.\n(A.344-45; Voir Dire Tr.l8, 52, 2oo, 2o7, 259, 293, 532,\n538-39, 635).

Judge Nathan explained that she “need not\nimagine a wholly hypothetical universe” to reach that\nconclusion. (A.344).

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span> and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023134.jpg": "[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement. The\ndefense team, houever, after extensive negotiation, chose to adopt\nthe Agreement. Since then counsel have objected to several steps\ntaken by the U.S. Atorney’s Office to effectuate the terms of the\nAgreement, in essence presenting collateral challenges to portions\nof the Agreement.\n\nIt is not the intention of this Office ever to require a defendant to\nenter a plea against his wishes. Your client has the right to proceed\nto trial. If your client is dissatisfied with his Agreement, or believes\nthat it is unlawful or unfair, we stand ready to unwind the\nAgreement.\n\nIn a separate, seven-page leter to Starr, with Villafafia’s and Sloman’s input, Acosta\nresponded to the substance of Starr’s November 28 leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher.\nFisher told OPR that she did not recall why Acosta, rather than her office, responded to the leter,\nbut she conjectured that “probably I was trying to make sure that somebody responded since [the\nCriminal Division wasn’t] going to respond.”!*\n\nIn his seven-page leter, sent to Starr on December 4, 2oo7, Acosta wrote:\n\nThe Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into between this Office\nand Mr. Epstein responds to Mr. Epstein’s desire to reach a global\nresolution of his state and federal criminal liability. Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.jpg": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis.

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge pom is\nmen with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\n<span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge porn is\nmen with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\nHis claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like\nyoung women.’ ~ '\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\n<span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from l998 until 2oo3. In\n2oo3, Jeffrey donated $6,5oo,ooo to Harvard University, where I work as\nDirector of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> of\nMathematics and Biology.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span> and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023134.tif": "[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], <span class=\"highlight\">Professor</span> Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement. The\ndefense team, houever, after extensive negotiation, chose to adopt\nthe Agreement. Since then counsel have objected to several steps\ntaken by the U.S. Atorney’s Office to effectuate the terms of the\nAgreement, in essence presenting collateral challenges to portions\nof the Agreement.\n\nIt is not the intention of this Office ever to require a defendant to\nenter a plea against his wishes. Your client has the right to proceed\nto trial. If your client is dissatisfied with his Agreement, or believes\nthat it is unlawful or unfair, we stand ready to unwind the\nAgreement.\n\nIn a separate, seven-page leter to Starr, with Villafafia’s and Sloman’s input, Acosta\nresponded to the substance of Starr’s November 28 leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher.\nFisher told OPR that she did not recall why Acosta, rather than her office, responded to the leter,\nbut she conjectured that “probably I was trying to make sure that somebody responded since [the\nCriminal Division wasn’t] going to respond.”!\n\nIn his seven-page leter, sent to Starr on December 4, 2oo7, Acosta wrote:\n\nThe Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into between this Office\nand Mr. Epstein responds to Mr. Epstein’s desire to reach a global\nresolution of his state and federal criminal liability. Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.tif": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\n<span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting <span class=\"highlight\">professor</span>.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028900.tif": "4\n. at\n4B THE PALM BEACH POST =» TUESDAY, JULY 25, 2oo6 &\nIndic Billionaire solicited 3 ti :\n; * .\nndictment: billionaire solicited 3 times :\nco\n.
