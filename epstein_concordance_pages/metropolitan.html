Acosta stated that the Palm\nBeach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou\nEpstein to walk free with no jail time, nothing.”\nAccording to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors con-\nsidered this outcome unacceptable, his office pursued\na difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to\nregister as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s\npress conference did not end the controversy, houever,\nand on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the\nPresident his resignation as Secretary of Labor.

On August l6, 2ol9, and after conducting an\nautopsy, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York issued a statement\nidentifying the cause of death as hanging, and the manner of death as suicide. In light of the death\nof the defendant prior to a conviction becoming final, the Government must request the Court\napprove the atached proposed order of nolle prosequi.\nConsistent with our practice throughout this case and our obligations under the Crime\nVictims’ Rights Act, the Government has made efforts to contact all identified victims since\nlearning of the death of the defendant and will similarly notify all knoun victims of the atached\norder, once entered. As this Office has previously stated publicly, it remains commited to doing\nits utmost to stand up for the victims who have already come forward, as well as for the many\nothers who have yet to do so.\nRespectfully submited,\nGEOFFREY S.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk.

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool275", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001329.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel2 of 25\n\nparties to support Maxwell’s bond did not alter this conclusion because “the amount\nof wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly\nenable her to compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses.” (/d. at l8). Judge\nNathan also rejected Maxwell’s proposed conditions of release to a relative’s\ncustody and private security guards, reiterating her concern regarding Maxwell’s\n“extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\n22. Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s\nargument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere\nwith her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).\nMaxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other\ninmates at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as\nmuch, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). Judge Nathan\nreiterated that she would continue to ensure that Maxwell is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense.

(Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001345.jpg": ".

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001347.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/oo88GAUNnt BOcument B2o Filedl2/o7 Re aBage tla 2\ng Wig SOO\nfy s) ENE \\\n(een U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\\3 es> |.)

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001355.jpg": "_ Caesesb:2o-cl/ oo88o4o st BOcument 4/29 2 Filed/o27/o4/PagPage fat 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool355", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001357.jpg": "_ _Casesb:2o-cr/ oo 88olANNnt BOctIMent 28.2 Filed/G2/o5/PagPage tlt 2\noe U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed.

The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court’s\nOrder, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.\n\nMDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a mater of course throughout the facility\nfor the safety and security of the inmates at the institution.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk.

The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001812.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page l of 4\nos U.S. Department of Justice\nN44 United States Atorney\n\ni Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of electronic discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court.

On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device.

The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant.

Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions.

(Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool835", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001842.jpg": ".

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list.

Our immediate goal is to rectify these\nproblems and improve the extraordinarily restrictive conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is\npresently confined within your facility.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Honorable Alison J. Nathan entered an order of detention\nremanding Ghislaine Maxwell to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. She has been detained\nsince her arrest on July 2, 2o2o and has been incarcerated at MDC under conditions that rival\nthose at USP Florence ADMAX. An exemplary inmate who poses no threat to her personal\nsafety or danger to anyone, she has spent the entirety of her detention in de facto solitary\nconfinement, tantamount to imprisonment as a defendant convicted of capital murder and\nincarcerated on death rou. The conditions of her detention are uterly inappropriate, especially so\nfor a non-violent defendant with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a quarter-\ncentury old.\n\nWithout a doubt, the BOP has imposed extraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint\non Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic consequences of negligence occurring at the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center (MCC- Manhatan) which resulted in the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein. The Atorney General of the United States has said as much. The BOP has admited\nthat the sanctions are not in response to a specific threat that Ms. Maxwell has shoun; rather they\nare in response to the high-profile nature of the case and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to\nkeep Epstein — an actual threat to himself — alive. Ms. Maxwell is bearing the brunt of\nincompetence on MCC’s watch. As ABC News reported:\n\n' Previous leters were sent to you on August 28, 2o2o and September 9, 2o2o.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool87o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 7 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nanything like her current regime.* The follouing conditions and circumstances of her detention,\nindividually and collectively, compromise her opportunity to confer with counsel and prepare her\ndefense for trial and are detrimental to her physical health and psychological well-being:\n\nDe Facto Solitary Confinement: Ms. Maxwell is the sole inmate in a housing unit. By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center, Unit lo South, aka “the terrorist SHU”. In\naddition, counsel is Curcio counsel for a client authorized for the death penalty who is in general\npopulation at the MCC.

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “[e]xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that [it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material.

This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal counsel through those communications.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC’s mail room, where every piece of mail is processed\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2727", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 2 of l2\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion.

It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002901.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl96 Filed o4/o6/2l Page l of 6\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. No. 92). This update is based on information\nprovided to the Government by MDC legal counsel regarding the conditions of the defendant’s\nconfinement over the last two months.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to both a\ndesktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on\nwhich to review discovery. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the\nMDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her atorneys.! This discovery review\n' Per BOP policy, all inmate emails are routinely purged every six months. In response to\ncomplaints from the defendant and defense counsel regarding prematurely deleted emails, MDC\nstaff examined the defendant’s inmate email account. That examination revealed that the\ndefendant had herself deleted some of her emails and had archived others. That examination\nrevealed no evidence to suggest that MDC staff deleted any of the defendant’s emails.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003182.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6 of 348\nabuse of minors. The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out ofrunning for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York <span class=\"highlight\">metropolitan</span> area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, the Government has already\nincluded Rule l6 discovery relating to the S2 Indictment in its prior productions to the defense,\nand the Government has provided the defense with a list of pages within those discovery\nproductions that are particularly pertinent to the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment.”\nContrary to the defense’s suggestion in its most recent leter, the largest discovery production in\nthis case came from electronic devices seized from Jeffrey Epstein. That production, dated\nNovember l8, 2o2o, included approximately l.2 million documents (totaling approximately 2.2\nmillion pages), all of which are text searchable and were produced in a format conducive to loading\nthat production into a document review platform.? Moreover, the defense’s suggestion that it will\nneed to re-review every single page of discovery produced to date is, at best, hyperbolic. The\ndefense has already reviewed the discovery and presumably knous which portions relate in\n> To the extent the defense complains of recent difficulties reviewing certain Highly Confidential\nimages or other items that must be reviewed in the presence of federal agents, it bears noting that\nthe Government repeatedly informed defense counsel beginning in the fall of 2o2o that those\nmaterials would be made available for review upon request. The defense did not request to review\nthose materials until March 2o2l, after which the Government coordinated with defense counsel,\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals to arrange for multiple days in April\n2o2l during which all of the materials were made available for review. The Government is of\ncourse willing to make similar arrangements should defense counsel believe additional review of\nthose materials is necessary.\n3 Only yesterday did defense counsel provide the Government with a list of documents that the\ndefendant has been unable to review from the prior discovery productions. As it has done in the\npast when such issues have been raised, the Government will work with its staff and staff at the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center (“MDC”) to address these issues as expeditiously as possible. The\nGovernment notes, houever, that had defense counsel raised these specific issues earlier, the\nGovernment could have addressed them much sooner.\nSimilarly, the defense only raised concerns about metadata on certain photographs this month,\neven though those photographs were produced to the defense in November 2o2o. The Government\nis working with its staff and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into and, where possible,\naddress the defense’s concerns as quickly as possible.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3947", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 Filed o4/23/2l Page4ofl4\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Maxwell,” the\nproduction from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law enforcement entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her pre-trial motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6. The peculiar failure of the government to produce these items\nin connection with the “entire” BSF file has yet to be explained. Clearly, BSF knew what the\nterms meant when it used them to block the production of this information in the civil litigation\nand it should not be alloued to profess confusion or ignorance here.\n\nThe cases cited by BSF are not helpful to its cause. For example, the court in United\nStates v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o),\nquashed the subpoena because it did “not satisfy the initial requirement of relevance.” In United\nStates v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), the defendant requested\n“any and all writings and records” related to the NYPD's contact with a particular confidential\nwitness who, according to the defendant, provided relevant information. The subpoena was\nunlimited in time or scope and, to the extent a time or scope were determined, production of the\ninformation was limited by l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. Jd. at 5l3.\n\nUnited States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4 CR l86 SCR, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2oo8), involved a subpoena served by the Defendant on the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention\n? Judge McMahon described the subpoena as a “general subpoena...I mean, everything that’s in\nBoies Schiller’s files, other than privileged documents, which of course you don’t exclude from\nyour subpoena.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3975", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

There, Mr. Pena requested that this Court\nissue five subpoenas to the MDC, MCC, and the DOC seeking records relating to two\ncooperating witnesses expected to testify at trial. Those subpoenas lacked any specificity and\nwere for:\n\nAny and all records relating to inmate [cooperator name], including but not limited\n\nto: (a) name and address of all [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] locations in which\n\n[cooperator name] was housed, the dates when [cooperator name] was housed in\n\nsuch facilities, and all records relating to the transfer of [cooperator name] between\n\nand among [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] facilities; (b) all records of phone calls made\n\nto and from [cooperator name] from [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] custody, including\n\nbut not limited to: call logs and audio recordings; and (c) all Corrlinks emails sent\n\nto and from [cooperator name’s] account.\n\nAs this Court correctly pointed out, the subpoenas were unlimited in time or scope and\ncalled for the production of either inadmissible hearsay or privileged information. /d. at *2.\nAdditionally, this Court observed in Pena, at *3, as applicable here, that:\n\n[T]he Court trusts that the Government is aware of its obligations under Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963), Giglio v.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York <span class=\"highlight\">metropolitan</span> area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

The government accuses Ms. Maxwell of using a cart to barricade the door to the VTC\nroom. The cart was never used to barricade. The government has chosen to make this an issue - when it\nnever was - to justify the restriction placed on the amount of legal materials Ms. Maxwell can bring into\nthe VTC room on any given day.\n\nThe government mischaracterizes facts to which it does not have first-hand knouledge.\nMs. Maxwell continues to use the cart daily to bring legal material into the VTC room and to remove\nthose documents at the end of the VTC session. Most of her legal papers are kept in a separate room.\nShe is only alloued to bring a certain portion of documents to any given VTC session and is not alloued\nto leave the VTC room to collect additional documents that may be needed for review and discussion\nwith counsel. The amount of legal material Ms. Maxwell can access depends upon rules that fluctuate\nwith each team rotated into the MDC every two weeks to guard her.\n\nThis limitation impacts the productivity of VTC and in-person legal conferences and\ncompromises Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

SDNY’s focus was always on righting the wrongs resulting from\nthe Florida prosecution: Epstein was undercharged and under punished, Epstein never faced his\naccusers, and his accusers were denied justice. Epstein was the target and the focus of the\nprosecution until his death in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) in August 2ol9.\nEpstein’s 2ol9 Arrest and Aftermath\n\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in connection with an SDNY indictment. He\nwas detained in the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center (“MCC”) until his untimely death in custody\non August l9, 2ol9. The highly publicized announcement of his arrest and detention came as a\nrelief and vindication for women who had filed complaints against him. His capture and\nconfinement quelled public outrage at Epstein’s lenient Florida plea deal from October 2oo7 and\nthe lou sentence he received. Epstein’s death approximately one month after his arrest eliminated\nany prospect ofa trial, again shocking and disappointing his accusers. It also highlighted the failure\nof the U.S. government to ensure that an inmate in federal custody, in such a sensitive and high-\nprofile case, could be kept safe and alive to face trial.\n\nIn the face of strong media and public uproar follouing Epstein’s death, the government\nfaced an urgency to appease the renewed distress of Epstein’s accusers and to repair the tarnished\nreputations of the DOJ and BOP in whose custody Epstein died. There would be no trial for\nEpstein and no public vindication and justice for his accusers. The government nou had a huge\nhole to fill: Epstein’s empty chair.

At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender.

Additionally, I conducted a collateral interview with Ms. Leah Saftian, part\nof Ms. Maxwell’s legal counsel and a longtime acquaintance, on July l6, 2o2l, to gain insight\ninto Ms. Maxwell’s current level of functioning.

Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse).

No. 2. (S.D.N.Y.). On August lo, 2ol9, while awaiting trial, Epstein commited\nsuicide in his cell in the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center in New York City. Soon after, the Court\ndismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52.\n\n2. On June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York charged\nEpstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking\nand coercion of minors. See Dkt. No. l. In December 2o2l, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several\ncounts. This Court sentenced Maxwell to 24o months’ imprisonment and the Second Circuit later\naffirmed her convictions and sentence. See United States v. Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2o24).\n\nDe On July 6, 2o25, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation\nannounced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein’s crimes and death. Since\nthen, the public’s interest in the Epstein mater has remained. Given this longstanding and\nlegitimate interest, the government nou moves to unseal grand jury transcripts associated with\nEpstein.\n\n2 The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States v. Epstein, l:l9-cr-49o (S.D.N.Y,), and in the\nSouthern District of Florida.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o38", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2of3l\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein commited suicide while in pretrial custody at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span>\nCorrectional Center (“MCC”). See generally Dkt. 67o at 3-4; Dkt. 785 at 2.\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in this District returned a six-count indictment against\nMaxwell, alleging that she had facilitated and participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of multiple\nminor girls. It charged her with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex\nacts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sex acts, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in\nillegal sexual activity, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transportation of a minor with intent to\nengage in illegal sexual activity, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2; and, in two counts,\nperjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. See Dkt. l (“Initial Indictment”). It based these\ncharges on Maxwell’s conduct with respect to three minor victims, whom the Government\nidentified pseudonymously. On July 8, 2o2o, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment\nthat made ministerial corrections. Dkt. l7 (“Sl Indictment”). On March 29, 2o2l, a different\ngrand jury in this District returned a second superseding indictment. It added two counts, based\non a fourth minor victim, to whom it also referred pseudonymously. One charged a sex\ntrafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; the other charged sex trafficking of a\nminor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. See Dkt. l87 (“S2 Indictment’). The\nS2 Indictment also broadened the time period of the sexual abuse crimes, originally alleged to\nspan l994 to l997, to span l994 to 2oo4.\n\nB.

Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“|A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020246.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel2 of 25\n\nparties to support Maxwell’s bond did not alter this conclusion because “the amount\nof wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly\nenable her to compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses.” (/d. at l8). Judge\nNathan also rejected Maxwell’s proposed conditions of release to a relative’s\ncustody and private security guards, reiterating her concern regarding Maxwell’s\n“extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\n22. Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s\nargument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere\nwith her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).\nMaxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other\ninmates at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as\nmuch, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers.

(Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o26o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020262.jpg": ".

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o262", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020264.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep QOZBOsAUNt SCutren 2B 2ile@ l2/OA/ 26a rage Lat 2\n4 J, SOF\nWa NESN NN\n(een U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\\3 es> |.)

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population.

When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o27o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020272.jpg": "_ CaSede2oteb®d33ouAEnnt Dibeutrenvl2e lFiked 92ool /2agPiagef Lat 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material.

Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed.

(Dkt. No.\n257). The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court’s\nOrder, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.\n\nMDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a mater of course throughout the facility\nfor the safety and security of the inmates at the institution. During these flashlight checks, MDC\nstaff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that\nthe inmate is present in the cell, breathing, and not in distress. MDC staff conduct flashlight checks\nevery 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the “SHU”) and conduct\nflashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular\nintervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nWith respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes\nbecause the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule. That is\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020355.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 89-2, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Pagel7 of 2o\nExhibit E\nDoc. 272\nGhislaine Maxwell’s Reply regarding conditions at\n<span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Detention Center\nMay 7, 2o2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o355", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020366.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o). In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span>\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5.

(See United States v. Days, l9 Cr. 6l9 (CM) (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 29, 2o2l), Sentencing Tr. at l3-l6 (describing incidents Tiffany Days\nexperienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being\ntransferred to the MDC)). There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\npopulation. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer. (See Dkt. l96 at 2).\n\n> As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC\nhave gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020393.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page/7 of 9l\n\no7/o6/2o2o Rule 5(c)(3) Documents Received as to Ghislaine Maxwell from the United States\nDistrict Court — District of New Hampshire.

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the\nCourt must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\"\n(ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i)\nbalance competing considerations against the presumption of access.

United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"),\n44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put\nforthincluding, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the\nletersfavor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to\ndocket the redacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons\noutlined in the Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York <span class=\"highlight\">metropolitan</span> area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “‘as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!®° At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

BACKGROUND\nA The Indictment Alleges that Mr. Thomas Conspired with Co-Defendant,\nNoel. and Created Faise Records\nThe government’s investigation in this case began upon the discovery of the alleged\nsuicide of Jeffrey Epstein, on August lo, 2ol9, at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center\n| (“MCC”).\nAt that time, Mr. Thomas, and Co-Defendant, Noel, were on duty as correctional officers\nin the section of the MCC, knoun as the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).\nThe indictment (Indictment, Introduction at l), alleges, among other things, that certain |\nprison counts, in other words, physically counting the prisoners in the cells, were not made by |\n. the defendants. In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred.

(Dkt. No. 33) (“Mot.”). Thomas seeks an order\ncompelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable\nunder any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas’s motion is\nentirely without merit and should be denied.!\n\nThomas concedes that the Government has produced a “multitude” of discovery directly\nrelevant to the charges against him. (Mot. 6). Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the\nGovernment to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his\npurported defenses, namely, that he commited the offenses because of staffing issues and\nsupervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (l) a\ncopy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General\n(“DOJ-OIG”), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary\nmaterials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2ol9 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (i) reports\nand documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and other agencies who were not and\nare not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (il) reports and documents related to “any\nand all [<span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center (““MCC”)] employees” who have engaged in “the same\nor similar conduct,” including an incident in “2oo5 or 2oo6” where officers failed to conduct\ncounts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and\ndocuments related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP\n\n' Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas’s pretrial\nmotions.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

Instead, he should have created a new master count\nsheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the\ninaccurate SHU count slip.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that\nafter learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in\nSENTRY.

The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) found that approximately ll cameras were located in and around the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August lo, 2ol9, including one at\nthe end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that shoued any movement in or out of inmate cells and in\nthe Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live\nvideo feeds. Follouing Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\ninvestigators atempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the\nsecurity cameras were working and transmiting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the\nSHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29,\n2ol9, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier. As a result, while the L Tier video camera\nwas transmiting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of August lo, 2ol9, the video\nwas not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and lo was a\ncamera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of\nthe common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to\nthe different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or atempting to enter the L Tier from\nthe common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and lo, would have been picked up by the video\nrecorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings shoued the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU\nstaff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from\nEpstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.\n|. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York\nAll video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR)\nsystem. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR l” and “DVR 2,” and each\nconsisted of l6 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York's security\ncameras were assigned to record to DVR l, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras\nassigned to DVR l only recorded to the DVR l hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to\nthe DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be\nretrieved from DVR l, and vice versa.\nThe OIG's investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2ol9, the\nElectronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the\nOIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2ol6, he found that the facility's security camera system\nneeded to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly\nmaintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be\nreplaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23448", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023461.jpg": "Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations\nI.

Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023470.jpg": "on the evening of August 9 and the morning of August lo.

The OIG did not credit her statement based on: (l) its review of the SHU security\ncamera video, which reflects Noel walking up and doun the stairs leading to some, but not all, of the tiers\nseveral minutes after the SHU inmate count had been called into the Control Center; (2) the lo p.m. count\nslip, which erroneously included the SHU Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and\nDelivery; (3) other BOP records; and (4) the Material Handler’s statement to the OIG that no one conducted\nthe lo p.m. count because everyone was tired.\nInstead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found\nthat officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, including the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas\nprimarily remained seated in the SHU Officers’ Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time,\nsuggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of Internet searches on MCC New York\ncomputers.

BOP values OIG's careful review of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the\nrecommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this\nengagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.\nThe facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this\nreport reflect a failure to follou BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While\nthis misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very\nsmall percentage of the approximately 35,ooo employees across more than l2o institutions who\ncontinue to strive for correctional excellence every day.\nIn the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve\naccountability.

Epstein died by suicide on August lo, 2ol9 while in BOP custody. The focus of DO] Office of the\nInspector General's (OIG) investigation was the conduct of BOP personnel.\nThe DO] OIG investigation and review identified:\n\ne Numerous and Serious Failures by MCC New York Staff. The DO) OIG found numerous and serious\nfailures by MCC New York staff constituting misconduct and dereliction of their duties. Among other\nthings, these failures resulted in Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excessive\namount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in\nhis locked cell on August lo at approximately 6:3o a.m.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Follouing a July 23,\n2ol9, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York\nPsychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate\ncellmate. On August 9, Epstein’s cell mate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York\nstaff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was\nassigned a new cellmate.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein\nand Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,\nand ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s\ndeath failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was\ndocumented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when\nEpstein’s cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would\nhave revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell. The OIG\nalso found that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after about lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:oo p.m. on\nAugust 9. MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to shou that they had been\nperformed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his\ndeath. Follouing a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged\ncriminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the\nemployees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S.\nAtorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023496.jpg": "Fwd: RE: United States v.

They claimed the Court has inherent\nauthority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is\nimportant. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't\nlooked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska writen by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)\nconcerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense\ncounsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a\nparticular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also\nasked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel\nobviously didn't knou that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go\nto SHU.)\nVarious atorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the \"timing of Epstein's death is curious\" and most\nof them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they\nadmited there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.\nThe government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement.\nThey also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC\nwith the judge presiding over their case.\nThen we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. | won't rehash the\nstatements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at\nthe government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court\noversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's\nco-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice.\nAt the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and\nended it. | expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the\ninvestigation at a later date, probably in a writen opinion.\nAnyway, | wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me knou if you have any\nquestions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; | verbally updated him, but he may need to\nforward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.\nThanks,\nCLC New York\n<span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, NY looo7\np: te Sano |\nf: 646-836-\nPage 79o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23559", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023560.jpg": "Fwd: Client Jeffrey Epstein\nFrom\nCharisma Edge,\nTo Lamine N'Diaye, Lee Plourde, NYM/Executive Stafi\n(BORG Shirley V.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the <span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023913.jpg": "Fwd: counsel having difficulty meeting with client\nFrom\nTo\nDate 2ol9/o7/o7 2o:5o\nSubject: Fwd: counsel having difficulty meeting with client\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nCaptain\n<span class=\"highlight\">Metropolitan</span> Correctional Center\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, NY looo7\nOffice: (646) at |\nBlackberry (646\n>> bop.gov> 7/7/2ol9 6:22 PM >>>\n| have veritie Ss an atorney in good standing in Massachusets.

Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's\nco-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice.\nAt the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case.

Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and\nrequested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a\nlocal hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at\nthe New York Presbyterian-Louer Manhatan Hospital in New York, New York.\nAt this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An\nautopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the\nmedical examiner in the near future.

He\ndenied any psychology history or symptoms. The Chief Psychologist spoke with Central Office on July 8, 2ol9,\nand it was determined he should be placed on suicide watch and seen for a suicide risk assessment after he\nreturns from court due to his increased suicide risk factors. Mr. Epstein was seen on July 9, 2ol9, for a suicide\nrisk assessment where he denied any suicide ideation, intention, or plan. Despite his risk factors of his sex\noffence charge, high profile case with media atention, and pretrial status housed in SHU, his protective factors\noutweighed his risk factors. He was future oriented, wanted to fight his case, and denied any mental health\nhistory or suicidality. He was removed from suicide watch and placed on psychology observation. He was seen\nthe follouing day at which time he requested to be celled alone if housed in SHU and was told he could not. Mr.\nEpstein was released from psychology observation and seen on July ll, 2ol9, in atorney conference. He\nexpressed concerns such as wearing an orange jumpsuit, not receiving medication, and not having enough water\nduring atorney visits. Mr. Epstein was seen one week later, July l6, 2ol9, for follou up and because he was\nasking to be seen. He did not express any psychological concerns, rather correctional issues such as not geting\na phone call and needing a spoon. An atempt at a SHU review was made on, July l8, 2ol9; houever, Mr.\nEpstein was with his legal team.\nKT AY\nMr. Epstein was seen daily while on psychology observation, each day denying he was suicidal.\nDuring one interview, he claimed he could not remember what happened because of his “sleep apnea.” On July\n3o, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was removed from psychology observation and returned to SHU. He reported he did not\nthink he could sleep in SHU because of the noise. He denied any psychological concerns.

On July lo, 2ol9,\nAcosta held a televised press conference to defend his\nand the USAO’s actions. Acosta stated that the Palm\nBeach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou\nEpstein to walk free with no jail time, nothing.”\nAccording to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors con-\nsidered this outcome unacceptable, his office pursued\na difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to\nregister as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s\npress conference did not end the controversy, houever,\nand on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the\nPresident his resignation as Secretary of Labor.

After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that if he had made the notations at the time of the\nlo p.m. count, he should not have cleared the count. Instead, he should have created a new master count\nsheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the\ninaccurate SHU count slip.

The OIG investigation and review\ndetermined that the only Operations Lieutenant on duty at the time was the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant, who started her shift at lo p.m. on August 9. When questioned by the OIG, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant adamantly denied having authorized a “ghost count” and the OIG identified no\nrecord or witness (other than Senior Officer Specialist 6) to indicate that she had done so.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that\nafter learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in\nSENTRY.
