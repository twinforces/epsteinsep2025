Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 8\n4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape atempt while in the community and involving\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000535.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36_ Filed o7/24/l9 Page 25 of 74 zd\n\nl heartland of federal jurisprudence or the federal statutes that\n2 were targeted for Mr. Epstein.\n\n3 THE COURT: They actually said that and then endorsed\n4 the agreement -—-\n\n5 MR.

Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured\nprofound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the\nyears follouing. To nou compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—\nespecially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the leter and the spirit of\nthe CVRA.\nThe CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point touard narrou tailoring, maximal\nprivacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight.\nWe respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.\nRespectfully submited,\nBradley Edwards\nBritany Henderson\nEDWARDS HENDERSON\n425 North Andrews Avenue, Suite 2\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 333ol\nTelephone: (954) 524-282o\nEmail: brad@cvlf.com\n\nbritany@cvlf.com\nPaul G.

Co—counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed\nof the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in\nadvance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public\ninterest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for\nviewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nCourthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000849.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC\nlegal counsel's December 4, 2o2o leter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to\nsummon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.\nNo. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government\nshall continue to submit writen status updates detailing any material changes to the\nconditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to\nlegal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with\ndefense counsel.

In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y.

All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000887.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 348\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span>” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of l5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page l3 of l4\nCONCLUSION\n\nJane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 should be alloued to join this action, pursuant to Rule 2l\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Today, November l5, Ms. Maxwell received\ndisclosures from the government under cover leter dated November 6. This is an excessively\nlong delay, especially since trial commences in two weeks.

At the November l, 2o2l conference, the defendant sought to preclude\nthe Government from arguing that the Minor Victims’ setlements with the EVCP reflects an\n<span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> of their claims, which “would be confusing to the jury” and “open the door to an\nexplanation from the defense about what really happened in those proceedings,” a request to which\nthe Court and Government agreed. (ll/ol/2l Tr. at 43:7-46:3). It remains the Government’s\nposition that cross-examination highlighting the fact that the Minor Victims received large\nsetlements for their claims would not open the door to a broader discussion of the Epstein Victims\nCompensation Program.\n\nIf, houever, the defendant engages in significant cross-examination about what Minor\nVictims did and did not say to the EVCP, and the reasons for those statements, it would create just\nthat confusion and open just that door. If the defendant argues that a Minor Victim should have,\nbut did not, make statements about the defendant to the EVCP, the Government will have to\nexplain to the jury the purpose of the EVCP and its adjudicative process in order to contextualize\nthat omission. Similarly, if the defendant argues that the Minor Victims’ testimony was biased by\nsome interrelationship between the EVCP and this case, the Government will have to explain to\nthe jury the absence of such an interrelationship, including the timeline of the Minor Victims’\nstatements relative to the timeline of the EVCP. Indeed, it appears that the defendant anticipates\narguing that some Minor Victims’ bias is shoun by the fact that their counsel was involved in\nstructuring the EVCP, which would require further response from the Government about the\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o4 _ Filed ll/24/2l Pagelofl\nSmith Villazer LLP\n25o West 55th Street, 3oth Floor\nSM IT H | V | LLAZOR New York, NY lool9\nwww.smithy llazorcom\nUSDCSDN¥ = ——~™N PATRICK J.

The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v.

The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo <span class=\"highlight\">Endorsement</span>, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll9 of 262 l824\nLC8VMAX4 Rodgers - direct\n\nl took for Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n2 Q.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019703.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagelo of l9\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC\nlegal counsel's December 4, 2o2o leter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to\nsummon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019726.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 3-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll69l, Pagell of 2o\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC\nlegal counsel's December 4, 2o2o leter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to\nsummon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions.

See Dkt. No. 7.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019755.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2o-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC\nlegal counsel's December 4, 2o2o leter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to\nsummon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions\nto Exhibit ll of the Government's submission by March 22, 2o2l (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool978o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019781.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019805.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC\nlegal counsel's December 4, 2o2o leter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to\nsummon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial.

In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l. The Court will\naccept only a joint leter with a joint proposal or with each sides views briefly stated.\nThe leter must atest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed leters will be struck.\nSO ORDERED. (Time excluded from 5/ll/2o2l until ll/29/2o2l) (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court concludes that these are\njudicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of\naccess atach. Id. at ll92o. In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put\nforward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties\nand alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.

The Court is still considering the logistics of when\nperemptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will\nbe exercised on November 29.

Once the Government confirms in that leter that it no longer seeks redaction\nof the name, then the Defense may file the temporarily sealed leter on the docket\nwithout redaction of the name.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

See Dkt. Nos. 6o5, 6o6. The Court\nhas reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with\nits prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 6o5. The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page82 of 9l\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

This conclusion is guided\nby the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the specific arguments the\nGovernment has put forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy\ninterests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.\nSee United States v.

The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial.

SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court is still considering the logistics of when\nperemptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will\nbe exercised on November 29.

The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the\nDefense indicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted. The\nGovernment is accordingly ORDERED to docket a leter on ECF on or before January\n28, 2o22, indicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this\nwitness. Once the Government confirms in that leter that it no longer seeks redaction\nof the name, then the Defense may file the temporarily sealed leter on the docket\nwithout redaction of the name.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22.

See Dkt. Nos. 6o5, 6o6. The Court\nhas reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with\nits prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 6o5. The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020569.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page83 of 92\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non-party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for his\nclient in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on behalf\nof the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the leter, the Court\nforwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to counsel, which it\nhas done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 2l, 2o2l leter but will\nfile it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non-party asserting that interest.\nThe Government is requested to forward this order to counsel for the non-party.

Nathan on 5/3/2l)(Gbo) (Entered: o5/o3/2o2l)\n\no5/o3/2o2l 265 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has received an exchange of leters that\npertain to an incident that took place on April 24, 2o2l. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers categorically deny\nthe allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff based on the incident\nand the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no views as to whether some\nother action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either sides allegations. This\nCourts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an\nopportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-client\ncommunications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to\ntake further action at this time. After recetving the defenses first leter motion, the Court\nordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why the Court should not grant the requested\nrelief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in part defense counsels original request and\nordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain questions about the April 24, 2o2l\nincident and the procedures in place to ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells\nlawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense counsels current application is that\nthis Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of the in-person atorney-client\nvisit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels\npreservation leter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to\nview or receive copies of those materials as a mater of law, they should be provided. To\nthe extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that\napplication is denied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell has the opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in\nlight of all relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained\ninmates in BOP custody.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office as\nthe trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent\nwith the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury.\nHouever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur\nduring the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the\nGovernment's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the\nCourt can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial\ncommencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in\nadvance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall\nmeet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The\nparties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone\nregarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4,\n2o2l. The Court will accept only a joint leter with a joint proposal or with each sides\nviews briefly stated. The leter must atest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed\nleters will be struck.

No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

No. 272, describes generalized grievances but makes\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 43/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020666.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page48 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nno additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges\nthe MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be reduced. The\nCourt also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell\nis subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her\nsafety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with the\ntreatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will\nenter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing\ndate remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for\nsentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599.\nSO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court received statements from Annie Farmer,\nKate, Virginia Giuffre, Maria Farmer, Sarah Ransome, Teresa Helm, Juliete Bryant, and\nElizabeth Stein. As indicated in its prior order, the Court will exercise its discretion to\npermit all of these individuals to be heard in writing. Dkt. No. 682. The Court also denied\nthe Defendants redaction requests. Id. All unredacted statements are nou part of the\nrecord. Dkt. Nos. 674, 675-l. Also as previously indicated in its order, the Court will\npermit Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre to make an oral statement at sentencing\nif they wish to do so. Dkt. No. 682. Further, having nou reviewed the full set of requests,\nand having heard from the Government that it does not object, Dkt. No. 678, the Court\ndeems it feasible to exercise its discretion to permit the remaining individuals who seek\nto themselves make an oral statement at sentencing to do so. They are: Teresa Helm,\nSarah Ransome, and Elizabeth Stein. In order to feasibly accomplish this in light of the\nanticipated length of the sentencing proceeding, while ensuring fairness and avoiding\ndelay of sentencing, each individual speaking orally may read a shortened version of their\npreviously submited writen statement. The Court deems counsel for the individuals to\nbe responsible for ensuring that anticipated statements conform to this requirement.

As a post-trial house-keeping mater, the Court has\ndetermined that a few miscellaneous court orders failed to be docketed during trial: -\nNovember l9, 2o2l Memorandum Opinion & Order re Witness-3 (Kate); - November 22,\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l lo2/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021247.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, hae 3536o38, Page/5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 73 of 348\nequipment.”* After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n4 Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\na The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021307.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel35 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 348\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span>” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021482.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o6 3536o39, Paged2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.**°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021534.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO 358 3536o39, Pagelo4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page lo of 2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o.

The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49-\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo <span class=\"highlight\">Endorsement</span>, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l534\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021953.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl3 Filed l2/l6/l9 Pagelofl\n& ~~ U.S. Department of Justice\n% = we , United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\n\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”\n\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\n\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\n\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\n\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\n\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\n\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\n\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\n\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\n\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\n\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\n\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\n\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\n\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\n\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n™ Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nl% The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023145.tif": "In another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span>” of the\ncase;!*’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023318.tif": "intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an <span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024008.jpg": "(ever teyey\nStaff Atorney\nCLC New York\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, NY looo7\np: 646-836\nf: 646-836-7665\n> >> PROMO barclaydamon.com> 7/23/2ol9 l2:34 PM >>>\nGood afternoon.\nIn follou up to my voice mail message earlier today, we understand that inmate [aie fs still\nhoused in your facility.\nAtached is Judge Smith’s leter order/<span class=\"highlight\">endorsement</span> scheduling a status conference in this mater\nfor August 9, 2ol9 at ll:oo a.m.\nIt is my understanding that Judge Smith’s Chambers will be initiating the call I noua\nbe made available to atend this status conference call.\nPlease let me knou if you need any other information in order to have PEG pvailable for\nthis telephone conference.\nThank you.\nBARCLAY DAMON“\n2ooo Five St Plaza * loo Chestnut Street » Rochester, NY l46o4\nD: (585) 295 F: (585) 295-84l7 »* E: NPENN@barclaydamon.com\nbarclaydamon.com +» vCard\nThis electronic mail transmission is intended only for the use of the individual or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential\ninformation belonging to the sender which is protected by the atorney-client privilege.
