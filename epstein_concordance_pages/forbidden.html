As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\n“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons <span class=\"highlight\">forbidden</span> by\nthe Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022095.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 33 of 34\nprosecutors not “objective evidence” warranting discovery); Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l23o (“to engage\nin a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or\nsurmise”). Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons <span class=\"highlight\">forbidden</span> by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984)\n(criticizing admission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o95\n"};
