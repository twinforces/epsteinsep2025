Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult.

Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of <span class=\"highlight\">consensus</span> regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming\n\nReceived 23 May 2ol3; revised 28 January 2ol4; accepted lo April 2ol4.\nAddress correspondence to William O’Donohue, Department of Psychology, University\nof Nevada, Reno, Mail Stop 298, Reno, NV 89557.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no <span class=\"highlight\">consensus</span> regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost.

Houever, there is a lack of <span class=\"highlight\">consensus</span> regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions.

Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no <span class=\"highlight\">consensus</span> regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5).

Bierschbach, Allocution and the Purposes of Victim Participation Under the\nCVRA, l9 FED. SENT’G REP. 44, 46—47 (2oo6)).\n\nThese healing effects are not unusual. One thorough assessment of the literature on victim\nparticipation explained: “The cumulative knouledge acquired from research in various jurisdictions,\nin countries with different legal systems, suggests that victims often benefit from participation and\ninput. With proper safeguards, the overall experience of providing input can be positive and\nempouering.” Edna Erez, Whos Afraid of the Big Bad Victim? Victim Impact Statements as Victim\nEmpouerment and Enhancement of Justice, CRIM. L. REV., July l999, at 545, 55o-5l. Thus, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">consensus</span> is that victim impact statements allou the victim “to regain a sense of dignity and respect\nrather than feeling pouerless and ashamed.” Kenna v.

During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general <span class=\"highlight\">consensus</span>\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.

The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021699.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page52 of 93\n39\n\nthe charges against Maxwell did not expire before the\nstatute of limitations was extended.
