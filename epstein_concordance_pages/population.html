The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison <span class=\"highlight\">Population</span>. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2.

Nevertheless, the Court noted that “inmates may be at a heightened risk of\ncontracting COVID-l9 should an outbreak develop,” and, based in part on this changed\ncircumstance, ordered the defendant released. /d.\n\nSince the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-l9 risks to inmates have\nincreased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-l9 in correctional\nfacilities. In the last month alone, the number of prison inmates knoun to have COVID-l9 has\ndoubled to 68,ooo, and prison deaths tied to COVID-l9 have increased by 73 percent.! Indeed,\nas of July 2, 2o2o, nine of the ten largest knoun clusters of the coronavirus in the United States\nare in federal prisons and county jails.” As this Court noted last month, “the ‘inability [of]\nindividuals to socially distance, shared communal spaces, and limited access to hygiene\nproducts’ [in correctional facilities] make community spread all but unavoidable.” United States\nv.

The risks are further enhanced by the possibility\nof a second wave of coronavirus cases.\n\nIn particular, COVID-l9 has begun to spread through the Metropolitan Detention Center\n(MDC), where Ms. Maxwell has been housed since the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred her\nthere on July 6, 2o2o.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'!

On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001230.jpg": "CaSade2ter MW I3oca one n Lee Gmeh'ol o4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a GeaGec? l Gb 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC.

If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE.

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001413.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 7o-l, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Page/7 of l4\n\n2.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> or degree of segregation.

But\nthat decision does not justify the degree to which the MDC overmanages Ms. Maxwell’s\ndetention and its detrimental effect on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for trial.\n\nWe have repeatedly expressed our concern for Ms. Maxwell’s health and the impact her\nconditions of confinement are having on her health and well-being, her ability to prepare for\ntrial, and the overall impact the severe conditions will have on her stamina to withstand trial,\nwhich we moved to the fall.

That same day, Judge Nathan directed\nthe Government to confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the District Court\nwith an explanation of what flashlight surveillance the MDC conducts on Maxwell\nat night, the basis for such surveillance, and the availability of an appropriate eye\ncovering for Maxwell’s use at night. (Dkt. 257).\n\nl9. On May 5, 2o2l, the Government submited a leter to Judge\nNathan conveying MDC legal counsel’s answers to the District Court’s questions.\n(Mot. Ex. D). First, the Government confirmed that all inmates at the MDC are\nsubject to some form of flashlight checks throughout the night for their safety and\nsecurity. In particular, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell in\norder to illuminate the cell enough to confirm that each inmate “is present in the cell,\nbreathing, and not in distress.” (/d. at l). MDC staff conduct such checks every\n3o minutes in the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), and approximately once per hour\nfor inmates housed in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. (/d.). Because Maxwell is on an\nenhanced security schedule, MDC staff conduct these nightime checks on her every\nl5 minutes. (d.). Second, the Government conveyed that the MDC has\ndetermined that, although Maxwell is not on suicide watch, increased frequency of\nnightime monitoring is warranted in her case due to several factors that “raise\nheightened safety and security concerns,” including the charges she faces, the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool45o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001461.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2l of 24\n\ninto Maxwell’s unit.t Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as\ncorroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding\ndescribed in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the\n“MCC”), not the MDC. (See United States v. Days, l9 Cr. 6l9 (CM) (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 29, 2o2l), Sentencing Tr. at l3-l6 (describing incidents Tiffany Days\nexperienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being\ntransferred to the MDC)). There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer. (See Dkt. l96 at 2).\n\n> As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC\nhave gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooool46l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 9 of 26\ninnocence.”). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter motion\nseeking the Court’s assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell’s ability\nto receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the protective\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old. Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ Disclosure of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment.

For these reasons, we\nrespectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order.\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nWe also seek the Court’s assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\nat the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), and her access to the discovery in this case, so\nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein’s body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to\nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom\ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms.\nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense\ncounsel.

In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s access to the standard prison\nresources available to other pretrial detainees in the general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> has been extensively\ncurtailed or eliminated altogether.\n\nThis treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to participate in her\ndefense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms.\nMaxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes\non them, and to discuss them with her atorneys. But there currently is no such structure in\nplace. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard\ndrive containing the discovery in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing\nthe first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDefense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a\nprocedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review discovery\nmaterials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are\ntwo significant flaws in this proposal:\n\ne The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms.\nMaxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including\nshouers. The BOP should not be permited to force Ms. Maxwell to\nchoose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and\nparticipating in her oun defense.\n\ne Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three\nhours a day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing\ndocuments in a complex case with voluminous document discovery, such\nas this one.

Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page5of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The defendant\nidentifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that,\nas detailed belou, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery\nin this case.\n\nRegarding the defendant’s request in connection with access to discovery, the Government\nunderstands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government’s\nfirst discovery production at the time the Defense Leter was filed—she received the materials on\nTuesday, August ll. While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day\nof access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including\nthose with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2o2l—as of earlier this week, and given\nthe volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity\nto access to her discovery from 7:oo a.m. to 8:oo p.m. every day of the week. Although this\narrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and\nis subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on\nan ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this\napplication should be denied as moot.\n\nC.

And until recently, Ms. Maxwell was denied access to the prison\ncommissary for no apparent reason.\n\nWe respect that the BOP needs to ensure the orderly operation of the MDC. But Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are unique to her and seem punitive rather than anything\nnecessary to ensure that the MDC as a whole is running smoothly. Accordingly, we respectfully\nrequest that, going forward, Ms. Maxwell be monitored in the same manner as other pretrial\ndetainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the same privileges given to\nother detainees.*\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully submit that the Court should grant Ms.\n\nMaxwell’s motion.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\n__/s/ Christian R.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August lo, 2o2o, the Defendant filed a leter motion related to two issues. Dkt. No.\n38. First, the Defendant seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense counsel\nimmediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Second, the\nDefendant seeks an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release the Defendant into\nthe general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> and to provide her with increased access to the discovery materials. For\nthe reasons that follou, Defendant’s requests are DENIED without prejudice.\nl. The Disclosure of Alleged Victims’ Identities\nThe Defendant first seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense\ncounsel immediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Dkt.\nNo. 38 at l. Her request is premature. Production of discovery, which may itself identify\nalleged victims and relevant witnesses to the defense, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nnot yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding witness lists and § 35oo material. The Court is mindful of the factors pointed to by the\nDefendant—in particular the fact that charges in this mater relate to conduct that allegedly took\nplace many years ago—and anticipates that such a schedule would require the disclosure of\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool743\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 2 of 4\nalleged victims and witnesses substantially in advance of trial. But that alone does not justify\nsuch relief at this very early stage. Follouing the close of discovery, the parties should meet and\nconfer on an appropriate schedule in light of all relevant factors. If the parties are unable to\nreach agreement as to a pretrial disclosure schedule, the Defendant may renew her request. The\ndenial is therefore without prejudice.\nI. The Defendant’s Conditions of Confinement\n\nIn her August lo, 2o2o leter motion, the Defendant also sought “an order directing\n[BOP] to release Ms. Maxwell into the general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> and provide Ms. Maxwell with\nincreased access to the discovery materials while she is detained so that she can meaningfully\nparticipate in the preparation of her defense.” Dkt. No. 38 at l. The Government responded that\nthe BOP has modified the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement so that she has access to\ndiscovery materials thirteen hours a day, seven days a week. Dkt. No. 4l at 5. The Defendant’s\nreply credited the BOP’s change in policy but nonetheless asked the Court to “confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP” and “that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the\nsame privileges given to other detainees.” Dkt. No. 42 at 4-5.\n\nThe Court denies this request. The BOP is providing the Defendant with conditions that\nallou her access to discovery materials so that she can meaningfully participate in the\npreparation of her defense. Further action by the Court as this juncture is therefore unnecessary.\nShould facts on the ground change such that the Defendant is not being provided sufficient\naccess to her legal materials, defense counsel may seek intervention by the Court.\n\nThe Defendant also requests that the Court order BOP that Ms. Maxwell “be monitored\nin the same manner as other pretrial detainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooool744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 3 of 4\nMaxwell the same privileges given to other detainees.” Dkt. No. 42 at 5. In a footnote, the\ndefense clarifies that “[a]s long as Ms. Maxwell is monitored in the same manner, and receives\nthe same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is not necessary to move her to the general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.” Dkt. No. 42 at 5 n.4.\n\nThe Court sees no basis for granting the Defendant’s request for an order directed to\nBOP. First, the Government has assured the Court that “[a]s with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff,” thereby ensuring that Ms. Maxwell’s ability to communicate with her counsel is in\nno way interfered. Dkt. No. 4l at 4n.5. And as to the more general implementation of\nsurveillance procedures, the Court credits BOP’s duty to ensure the safety and security of the\nDefendant as justifying the measures BOP has adopted. See Bell v. Wolfish, 44l U.S. 52o, 547\n(l979) (‘Prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption\nand execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\norder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”). Nor does the Defendant provide\nany basis for the Court to conclude that the level of surveillance is punitive. Dkt. No. 42 at 5.\nThough pretrial detainees “may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance\nwith due process of law,” Wolfish, 44l U.S. at 535, it does not follou that surveillance measures\nare punitive just because the Defendant deems them “onerous.” Dkt. No. 42 at 4. The\nDefendant has provided the Court with no evidence, and no reason to believe, that the\nsurveillance measures are motivated by improper purposes.\n\nAs aresult, Defendant’s request is denied. To ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to\ncontinue to adequately participate in her defense, houever, the Court hereby ORDERS the\nGovernment to provide writen status updates every 9o days detailing any material changes to the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool745\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 75 Filed ll/24/2o Page 2 of 2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\nMDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure\nDOJ-OGR-ooool859\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page l of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAs counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we write in response to the leter from Sophia\nPapapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff atorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The leter fails to address a\nnumber of concerns raised in our October 29\" leter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised with\nthe Court. The MDC’s leter also contains inaccuracies and omissions and raises more questions\nthan it atempts to answer. Rather than paraphrase our leter, we are providing it for the Court’s\nconsideration. (See Exhibit A.) We renew our request that Warden Tellez respond directly to\nthe Court and counsel and explain why Ms. Maxwell must be detained under such harsh and\nrestrictive conditions.\n\nUsing the term “[iJn her current assignment,” the leter atempts to present a picture of\ncompliance with total disregard of the deficiencies of Ms. Maxwell’s treatment up to this point.\nWhile her meals may currently be in accordance with BOP policy, until September they were\nnot. While her weight may currently be fairly consistent, she had lost over l5 pounds, and she is\nsustaining hair loss. It took approximately six weeks follouing arrival to the MDC for Ms.\nMaxwell to be permited personal calls on par with other inmates; previously she was given two\ncalls per month unless authorized by the warden. While generally permited to be out of her\nisolation cell and confined to the day room from 7:oo am to 8:oo pm with one hour of recreation\ntime, general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> inmates are permited to be out of their cells until 9:3o pm and given\nmore extensive recreation time. While flashlight checks may be performed during regular\nrounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to such checks every l5 minutes. Further, because Ms. Maxwell\nis kept in isolation, she in not permited to participate in activities accorded inmates in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>, such as programming (educational, leisure and wellness), movies, religious services,\njob assignment.\n\nTouting that Ms. Maxwell is not in contact with “a number of inmates who have tested\npositive for COVID-l9,” the MDC’s leter totally ignores that she was in contact with a member\nof her revolving security team who tested positive, necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be\nquarantined for l4 days. This further diminished her ability to prepare her defense and resulted in\ncancelled legal visits. While the leter accurately states that one video teleconference (VTC) was\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 2 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nscheduled for August l7\", it fails to report that the VTC was unsuccessful because the audio\nconnection failed; and, despite constant ongoing requests, no subsequent VTCs have been\nscheduled.\n\nThe leter ignores the fact that there is an outbreak of COVID in the MDC, with some 8o\ninmates testing positive, far in excess of the number of positive cases reported from March to\nDecember. See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/BOP (reported l2/7/2o). While Ms. Maxwell is\nisolated from general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> inmates, the crew of security guards who monitor her 24/7 are\nnot subject to mandatory testing, with some guards assigned to her detail rotating in from BOP\nfacilities where inmates and staff have tested positive. And while Ms. Maxwell may not be\nexposed to other inmates, she is exposed to individuals while escorted to a common area for\nbody scanning, further risking her exposure to COVID.\n\nWhile reciting BOP policy, the leter fails to address:\n\n= why as an isolated inmate, Ms. Maxwell is subject to repeated searching;\n\n=» why Ms. Maxwell is under 24/7 surveillance by a cadre of officers who are\nrequired to report her status every l5 minutes;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell is constantly surveilled by a hand-held camera, even during\natorney-client conferences;\n\n= why all of Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails were erased from the CorrLinks system;\n\n=\" why immediately after receiving two nasal swab COVID tests, Ms. Maxwell was\nrequired to remove her mask for an in-mouth inspection, heightening her exposure\nto COVID as she was placed in quarantine;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell’s legal papers are repeatedly inspected.\n\nWarden Tellez has failed to respond to our assertion that the MDC has imposed\nextraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint on Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic\nconsequences of negligence occurring at the MCC that resulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Atorney General of the United States has said as much. Beyond the decision to not place\nMs. Maxwell in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>, to which we have no objection, the leter virtually concedes\nthat other restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are not in response to any concern specific to her\nand tacitly suggests the heightened restrictions are in response to the high-profile nature of the\ncase and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to keep Epstein — an actual threat to himself —\nalive. As ABC News reported:\n\nAtorney General William Barr told ABC News on Wednesday that he is keeping a close\n\nwatch to make sure that Maxwell makes it to trial after Epstein died by suicide in a\n\nManhatan jail while awaiting trial last year. Barr said he was \"/ivid \" Epstein died while\n\nin custody last August. The investigation into Epstein has continued even after his death.\n\nI believe very strongly in that case,\" Barr told ABC News on Wednesday. .. . “And as\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 7 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nanything like her current regime.* The follouing conditions and circumstances of her detention,\nindividually and collectively, compromise her opportunity to confer with counsel and prepare her\ndefense for trial and are detrimental to her physical health and psychological well-being:\n\nDe Facto Solitary Confinement: Ms. Maxwell is the sole inmate in a housing unit. By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Unit lo South, aka “the terrorist SHU”. In\naddition, counsel is Curcio counsel for a client authorized for the death penalty who is in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> at the MCC. Having visited BOP facilities during the past 35 years and representing clients\ncharged with the most heinous and violent crimes of murder, counsel had never had a client subjected to\nsuch punitive conditions of pretrial (or post-conviction) incarceration as in the present case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 34 of 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2l of 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID.

See Declaration of Jeffrey Martin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v.\nBalde, No. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF, Dkt. No. 6l-l (filed Nov. 9, 2o2o), Exhibit A (“Martin Decl.”).\nBecause the jury wheels are emptied and refilled only every four years, follouing a presidential\nelection, and the defendant in Balde, like Ms. Maxwell, was indicted in June 2o2o, Ms.\nMaxwell’s grand jury was presumably drawn from the same wheels Mr. Martin analyzed.\n\nMr. Martin found significant underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons within\nthe White Plains qualified jury wheel—not only when compared to the eligible juror <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>\nin the Manhatan counties (Martin Decl. {] 6l-62, 69-7o), but also when compared to the eligible\njuror <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the District as a whole (id. {| 59-6o, 67-68).\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a grand jury selected from a fair\ncross-section of the community.

The only geographic nexus in this case to this\nDistrict—Epstein’s New York residence—is in the Manhatan Division, and the case will be\ntried within the Manhatan Division. The appropriate comparison here is therefore between the\nManhatan Division and the qualified wheel for White Plains.\n\nMr. Martin’s analysis found significant underrepresentation of both Black and Hispanic\npersons in the White Plains qualified wheel when compared to the eligible juror <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of\nthe Manhatan Division. Mr. Martin found that the eligible juror <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the Manhatan\nDivision is 2o.92% Black and 28.o6% Hispanic (Martin Decl. § 2o), while the White Plans\nqualified wheel refilled in February 2ol7 (and thus in effect in 2o2o) was 8.76% Black and\nlo.48% Hispanic (id. § 55). Thus, Mr. Martin found an “Absolute Disparity” of l2.l6%\nunderrepresentation for Black jurors (2o.92% minus 8.76%) and an “Absolute Disparity” of\nl7.58% for Hispanic jurors (28.o6% minus lo.48%).

For the whole District, the eligible juror <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> is l8.o9%\nBlack and 23.4l% Hispanic. /d. § l9.

Regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nis compared to the eligible jury <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the Manhatan Division or to that of the entire\nSouthern District of New York, the primary reason for the significant underrepresentation of\nBlack and Hispanic jurors on the White Plains wheel is the choice to pursue an indictment from a\ngrand jury drawn from the White Plains Division, as opposed to the Manhatan Division or the\nDistrict as a whole. This decision resulted in the systematic exclusion of eligible jurors residing\nin the southern counties of this District.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Martin’s standard deviation analysis found that regardless of whether the\nManhatan Division or the entire District is used as the point of comparison, the percent of both\nBlack and Hispanic jurors in the White Plains jury wheel differs from that in the comparison\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> by more than three standard deviations.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nBy leter to the Court, dated January 25, 2o2l (Dkt.ll7 at 2-3), the MDC raised objection\nto the Court’s order, unopposed by the government, directing the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to\nuse on a laptop computer on weekends and holidays. (Dkt. ll6 at 2). The MDC has failed to\nstate a valid or compelling reason for opposing the Court’s directive.\n\nThe MDC does not identify any valid reason why Ms. Maxwell cannot have access to the\nlaptop computer on weekends and holidays. The MDC does not argue, for example, that access\nto the laptop cannot be provided because of issues related to safety or security, staffing, or (to\nquote the government) the need to “manag[e] its inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.” Instead, in opposition to\nthe Court’s order, the MDC repeats its stock response: Ms. Maxwell has received significant\namount of time to review her discovery and has more contact with counsel than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted. The MDC’s fixation on the relative time Ms. Maxwell has been given to\nreview discovery is totally misguided. The government has produced millions of pages of\ndiscovery. Ms. Maxwell has the right to review all of them in order to prepare her defense for\ntrial. To do that, she needs access to the laptop for as much time as possible, including the\nweekends and holidays because the prison computers are incapable of reading the millions of\ndiscovery documents. Ms. Maxwell loses lo or more hours per week due to delay in receiving\nthe laptop, problems caused by the MDC computer, and inability to access the computer during\nmorning and afternoon counts on the weekends. Comparing Ms. Maxwell to other inmates does\nnot justify restricting her use of the laptop to review discovery.\n\nThe MDC’s proposed solution—that Ms. Maxwell can simply use the prison computer on\nthe weekends and holidays to review discovery—is uterly inadequate. As Ms. Maxwell has\npointed out on many occasions, the prison computer is incapable of reading a significant portion\nof the discovery, including but not limited to native files, Excel files, some video and audio files,\nand anything requiring Cellebrite software. The MDC concedes this fact in their leter—Ms.\nMaxwell cannot review all of her discovery on the prison computer. And using it causes a\ncolossal waste of time. For example, if Ms. Maxwell locates a document on the prison computer\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl85 Filed o3/26/2l Page 2of2\nPage 2\nIn particular, in assessing the defendant’s Sixth Amendment claim, Judge Croty found\n\nthat: (l) the relevant jury pool is the White Plains Master Wheel (Schulte Op. 8-9); (2) the relevant\n“community” is the White Plains voting age <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> (Schulte Op. 9-ll); (3) it was entirely\nproper for the Government to seek an indictment in White Plains, despite the fact that the trial is\nlikely to occur in Manhatan (Schulte Op. ll-l3); and (4) the appropriate method of statistical\ncomparison is the “absolute disparity” method (Schulte Op. l3-l4).

See id. On June 8, 2o2o, houever, the Government sought and obtained a |\nthird superseding Indictment from a grand jury siting in the District’s White Plains courthouse. |\n(Schulte Br, at 2; Gov’t Opp. Br. at 2.) The Indictment charges Schulte with nine criminal\ncounts relating to his alleged transmission of national defense information to WikiLeaks. (ECF |\n4o5.) According to the Government, the White Plains grand jury that returned the superseding |\nIndictment was the sole grand jury empaneled at the time. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l4.) :\nIl. Motion to Dismiss\nSchulte nou moves to dismiss the Indictment on the grounds that it was unlawfully |\nobtained in violation of (l) the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause; (2) the Sixth\nAmendment’s fair cross-section requirement; and (3) the ISSA. (ECF 435.) He primarily |\ncontends that the White Plains grand jury venire—from which the Indictment was obtained—did\nnot reflect a fair cross-section of the African American and Hispanic American populations in :\nthe community. And he contends that these effects are symptomatic of the exclusionary\nprocesses that are inherent in the District’s jury selection system. Relatedly, Schulte argues that\nthe Government’s decision to seek the Indictment from White Plains was improperly made.\nIll. The District’s Jury Plan\nTo understand Schulte’s claims, it is necessary to orient ourselves to some background\nknouledge of the District’s jury selection process. Under the JSSA, each federal district court\nmust “devise and place in operation a writen plan for random selection of grand and petit\njurors.” 28 U.S.C, § l863(a). The District’s jury selection plan (“Jury Plan”), which has been in\nexistence since 2oo9, provides the blueprint for the random selection of grand and petit jurors\nthroughout the District. See Amended Plan for the Random Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (hereinafter “Jury\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002835.jpg": "CaGade2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafade bf BO 2o\n*8 (“The absolute disparity method, on the other hand, appears to be the preferred method for :\nanalyzing jury underrepresentation under the Sixth Amendment in the Second Circuit.”). The\nCourt will therefore analyze the underrepresentation inquiry using the absolute disparity method. |\nThe absolute disparity method measures the difference between the groups’ !\nrepresentation in the relevant community and their representation in the jury venire. See Rioux, :\n97 F.3d at 655—56. For example, if African Americans compose lo% of the community but only\n5% of the jury venire, the absolute disparity is 5%. See id. Under Second Circuit precedents, |\nabsolute disparities nearly as high as 5% have not been found to satisfy the underrepresentation\nelement under Duren. See United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677-78 (2d Cir. l99o) (holding |\nabsolute disparities of 3.6% and 4.7% were insufficient to satisfy Duren’s second element); see :\nalso Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658 (l.58% and 2.l4% were insufficient); Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *8 |\n(3.69% and 3.64% were insufficient); Barnes, 52o F. Supp. 2d at 5l5 (2.8% and 2.3% were\ninsufficient).\nThe Court holds that the absolute disparities here fall comfortably within the outer limits :\nprovided by these past decisions. The partics do not dispute that African Americans make up )\nll.2o% and Hispanic Americans make up l2.97% of the White Plains master wheel. (Gov’t\nOpp. Br. at 2o.) In the relevant community, African Americans make up l2.45% and Hispanic\nAmericans l4.l2% of the jury eligible <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. (Schulte Reply at 6-7, Gov’t Opp. Br. at l8.)\nAccordingly, the absolute disparities are l.25% for African Americans (l2.45% - ll.2o%) and\nl.l5% for Hispanic Americans (l4.l2% - l2.97%).

Discussion\n\nThe Government’s decision to seek an indictment of the defendant from a grand jury siting\nin White Plains was entirely appropriate and consistent with the Constitution, the JSSA, and the\nSDNY local rules. The defendant’s claims to the contrary rest on a faulty premise: That a\ndefendant who is likely to be tried in the Manhatan courthouse must be indicted by a grand jury\nsiting in that same courthouse. That is not the law. See Section XI.C.l, infra.\n\nThat foundational error is fatal to the defendant’s fair cross-section claim. When the proper\ncomparators are considered—the White Plains Master (or Qualified) Wheels to the voting age\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the counties from which juries in White Plains are drawn, rather than the defendant’s\napples-to-oranges comparison of the White Plains Qualified Jury Wheel to the <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the\nManhatan “Division”’—the defendant fails to establish unfair underrepresentation under the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. Moreover, the defendant has not established that any disparity\nresulted from systemic exclusion of a particular group. Accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nl. The Defendant Was Properly Indicted by a Grand Jury Siting in\nWhite Plains\n\nAt the heart of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim is her contention that the\n\nGovernment seeking an indictment from a grand jury siting in White Plains—which was the only\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 239\nspecific than the District where the offense was allegedly commited.”). Rather, “[c]ourts have\nbroad latitude in defining the geographic area from which juries will be selected.” United States\nv. Yonkers Contracting Co., Inc., 682 F. Supp. 757, 768 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Consistent with the\nforegoing, the SDNY Jury Plan creates two separate Master Wheels—one for the White Plains\ncourthouse and one for the Manhatan courthouse, each of which draws from certain counties, with\nsome overlapping counties. SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o. Under the\nrelevant jury plan, jurors for trials held in Brooklyn were drawn from the entire Eastern District,\nwhile jurors for trials held in the “Long Island Division,” which included the Uniondale\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 239\n\nit is inapposite as well: both cases appear to concern instances in which the grand jury and trial\njury sat in the same courthouse, and thus there was no cause to consider whether the same\n“community” was relevant to separate challenges to the grand and petit juries. See United States\nv. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. l998); United States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp.\n869, 874-75 (E.D.N.Y. l995). As such, neither case supports the proposition that where a\ndefendant is challenging the selection of the grand jury, the relevant “community” is the\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the location in which her trial will be held. Such a comparison is unjustified, as\nBahna makes clear: That case appears to involve conduct that occurred in Brooklyn, appears to\nhave been indicted in Brooklyn, was originally tried in Brooklyn, and was later transferred to\nUniondale, where it was tried with a jury drawn from the “Long Island Division.” Yet the Second\nCircuit rejected the defendant’s claimed entitlement to a jury drawn from Kings, Queens and\nRichmond counties, or the entire Eastern District, because that argument—like the defendant’s\nhere—was based on a flawed premise.\n\nThe defendant’s proposed rule—comparing the composition of the grand jury venire to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the expected trial location—makes litle legal or practical sense. Where, as here,\nthe defendant’s challenge is to the indictment, the proceeding for which the defendant is entitled\nto expect a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community is not the trial, but the grand\njury proceeding itself. Indeed, that must be the case, as it is not yet determined where the trial in\nthis mater will in fact occur. The defendant assumes that her trial will ultimately be held at the\nManhatan courthouse. While that is /ikely to be the case, it is not necessarily so. Bahna again\nillustrates the point, as a case originally tried in Brooklyn was reassigned to Uniondale for the\nretrial “to accommodate trial congestion in the court’s calendar during a period of judicial\nemergency... .” United States v.

The Defendant Has Not Established that Blacks or Hispanics\nAre Unfairly Represented\n\nThe second prong of the Duren test requires the Court to determine whether representation\nof either or both of the “distinctive” groups in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and\nreasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community. Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nThis requires determining the relevant comparators—i.e., what is the “relevant jury pool” and what\nis the community “<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>” against which it is compared—as well as the appropriate method\nof statistical comparison. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 656.\n\nHere, the defendant contends that the relevant jury pool is the White Plains Qualified\nWheel. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5-6). The Government believes that the relevant jury pool is the White\nPlains Master Wheel, but, as set forth belou, the defendant’s claim fails even using the White\nPlains Qualified Wheel.\n\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995). Ina\ndetailed survey of the case law, the district court in Rioux found that cases have examined different\nrelevant pools, including the master wheel, the qualified wheel over a period of time, the venires\n\n2o5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 239\nhou the particular Master Wheel is selected. It says nothing about the process by which a Master\nWheel is reduced to the subset of qualified jurors contained in the Qualified Wheel. Because the\n“systematic defect” alleged by the defendant relates to the Master Jury Wheel, the White Plains\nMaster Jury Wheel is the appropriate “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 93o F. Supp. at l566-68.\n\nAlthough the Master Jury Wheel does not include reliable information regarding the race\nand ethnicity of the individuals selected from voter registration lists, the racial and ethnic makeup\nof the White Plains Master Jury Wheel can be estimated using geocoding and Bayesian Improved\nSurname Geocoding (“BISG”).© Taking into account those estimates, the White Plains Master\nWheel is ll.2o% Black or African-American and l2.97% Hispanic or Latino. (Siskin Aff. at §\n28). By contrast, the White Plains Qualified Wheel is 8.76% Black or African-American and\nlo.48% Hispanic or Latino. (/d. at § l7).\n\nThe community <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> for purposes of assessing representativeness is the <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>\neligible for jury service in the community. See, e.g., Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 524 (l975)\n(focusing on <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> eligible for jury service); Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657 (“We conclude that the\nappropriate measure in this case is the eighteen and older subset of the <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> ....”). But hou\nshould the relevant “community” be defined? The defendant contends that it is the jury eligible\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the “Manhatan Division,” because that is where the offense occurred and where she\nassumes she will be tried.

(See Siskin Aff. at § l9; see also Martin Aff. at § 2l).\n\nOnce the relevant comparators are defined, an additional threshold question is the statistical\nmethod by which to compare them. Courts have applied different approaches over time, such as\nthe statistical decision theory, the comparative disparity theory, and the absolute disparity theory.\nSee Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655. Although no method is perfect, see Berghuis v. Smith, 559 U.S. 3l4,\n329 (2olo), the Second Circuit has made clear that the comparative disparity theory is disfavored\nand strongly suggested that the absolute disparity theory is generally appropriate, see Rioux, 97\nF.3d at 655-56; see also United States v. Barnes, 52o F. Supp. 2d 5lo, 5l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“[T]he\nabsolute disparity approach is the primary approach used in this Circuit.”’).\n\nThe “absolute disparity” approach measures the absolute numerical difference between the\ndistinctive group’s representation in the community <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> and the group’s representation in\nthe relevant jury pool. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655; United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l, 3o-\n3l (E.D.N.Y. 2olo), affd 479 F. App’x 372, 373 (2d Cir. 2ol2). For example, if Blacks\nrepresented lo% of the community <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> but only 2% of the relevant jury pool, the “absolute\ndisparity” would be 8%.\n\nThere is no specific numerical threshold that constitutes unacceptable disparity under the\n“absolute disparity” method. “[P]erfectly proportional representation is not required, since no\nThe American Community Survey gathers demographic information in between the decennial\ncensus, and is published by the United States Census Bureau.

Guzman, 337 F.\nSupp. l4o, l43 (S.D.N.Y. l972); see also Taylor, 4l9 U.S. at 538. The mere fact that a jury\nselection system is imperfect does not make it invalid. Swain v. Alabama, 38o U.S. 2o2, 2o9\n(l965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute\ndisparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation. See,\ne.g., Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States v.\nRamnath, l3l F.3d l32, l32 (2d Cir. l997) (3.45% for African-Americans and 4.87% for\nHispanics); see also Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 34-35 (collecting out-of-circuit cases rejecting\nclaims presenting similar and even higher disparities).”!\n\nProperly calculated, the “absolute disparity” in this case falls comfortably within the range\ndeemed acceptable by the Second Circuit and other courts. As noted, the “relevant jury pool” is\nthe White Plains Master Wheel, which is comprised of ll.2o% Black or African-American persons\nand l2.97% Latino or Hispanic persons. (Siskin Aff. at § 28). The “community <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>” is the\njury eligible <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> for the five counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn,\nwhich was comprised of l2.45% Black or African-American persons and l4.l2% Hispanic or\nLatino persons in 2ol8. (Ud. at § l9). This yields an “absolute disparity” of l.25% for Black or\nAfrican-American persons and l.l5% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at 28). That disparity\ndoes not rise to the level of satisfying the second prong of the Duren test.\n| In United States v. Jackman, the Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity of 2.5% for Black\nor African-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient to satisfy the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. 46 F.3d l24o (2d Cir. l995). The unique facts of Jackman make\nit readily distinguishable. The jury clerk in Jackman relied on a qualified jury wheel that was\nmostly drawn from a master jury wheel that completely excluded potential jurors from two cities\nin the Division—cities that accounted for 62.93% of the voting-age Black <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> and 68.o9%\nof the voting-age Hispanic <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> in the division. See id. at l242-44. This resulted in a venire\ncomprised of no Black or African-American persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. /d. at\nl244. See also id. at l252 (Walker, J., dissenting) (stating that the majority’s decision was “at\nodds with every decision in every circuit applying the Duren test’).\n\n2o9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 239\n\nThe result is the same even if the defendant’s preferred relevant jury pool is used. The\nWhite Plains Qualified Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American persons and\nlo.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § l7; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in\nabsolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within\nthe range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren\ntest. Moreover, as discussed belou, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains\nQualified Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>,\nare not the result of systematic exclusion.\n\nIt is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhatan Division” or the entire Southern\nDistrict that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second\nprong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the\nsecond prong.\n\nb. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic\nExclusion\n\nEven assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she\nhas not—she most certainly has not demonstrated that any underrepresentation is “due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis\nadded). That is, she cannot establish that the exclusion is the product of “the system of jury\nselection itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot\nsatisfy the third prong of Duren.\n\nAs then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic exclusion does not occur simply\nbecause a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”\nBarlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 4o; see also United States v. Barlou, 479 F. App’x 372, 373 (2d Cir.\n\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 239\n2ol2) (affirming Judge Bianco’s “thorough and well-reasoned” opinion). Indeed, “‘[a] selection\nprocess that is facially neutral is unlikely to demonstrate systematic exclusion.’” United States v.\nSavage, 97o F.3d 2l7, 259 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (brackets in original) (quoting Houell v. Superintendent\nRockview SCI, 939 F.3d 26o, 269 (2d Cir. 2ol9)). Moreover, a defendant cannot “make out a\nprima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, might\ncontribute to a group’s underrepresentation.” Berghuis, 559 U.S. at 332 (emphasis in original).\n\nInsofar as the underrepresentation here is measured by a comparison of the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the “Manhatan Division” or entire Southern\nDistrict, the defendant’s argument rests entirely on the prosecution’s decision to pursue an\nindictment in White Plains rather than Manhatan. (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). That decision was entirely\nproper, as set forth above. See Section XI.C.l, supra. And even if it were the case that this decision\nresulted in substantial underrepresentation, it nevertheless does not amount to “systematic\nexclusion . . . in the jury-selection process.” The prosecution’s decision as to where to seek an\nindictment was based entirely on the availability of grand juries during a pandemic, which has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected. The defendant points to no\nother source of any supposed systemic exclusion of any identified group. Accordingly, the\ndefendant’s claim also fails at the third prong of Duren.\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys.

I also was asked to comment\non the appropriateness and accuracy of the defendant’s expert Jeffery Martin’s assessment of the\ndifference between the qualified jury wheel and the community.\n\nWW. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n3. The African American percentage of the White Plains qualified jury wheel was 3.69\npercentage points louer than that in the White Plains community (8.76% versus l2.45%,\nrespectively) and the Hispanic percentage was 3.64 percentage points louer than that in the\nWhite Plains community (lo.48% versus l4.l2%, respectively). This is consistent with what\nDefendant’s expert Mr. Martin reports in his declaration.\n\n4. The disparities were almost exclusively due to the patern of African Americans and\nHispanics having been sent a juror questionnaire, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused at a significantly louer rate than other races or ethnicities after returning the\nquestionnaire. Of the 3.69 percentage point difference by race (African American), 2.58 (or\n69.9% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor. Of the 3.64 percentage point difference\nby ethnicity (Hispanic), 2.59% (or 7l.2% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor.\n\n5.

Mr. Martin also compared the qualified jury wheel for White Plains with the\nManhatan community and for the overall Southern District community. The White Plains\nmaster jury wheel is designed to be representative of the White Plains community, not the\nManhatan or Southern District community. The Manhatan and the Southern District\ncommunities are significantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains\ncommunity. Thus, since the White Plains master jury wheel is designed to be representative of\nthe White Plains community, by design it will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District community with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.\n\nIV. DATA RELIED UPON\n\nl2. The data I received and relied upon is listed in Appendix B of this declaration.\nV. FINDINGS\nA. Overview of Qualified Jury Wheel Selection Process.\n\nl3. The master jury wheel which forms the basis for the qualified jury wheel for the\nWhite Plains community of the Southern District of New York is supposed to be drawn via a\nsimple? random sample from the voter lists from the six counties (Westchester, Putnam,\nRockland, Orange, Sullivan and Dutchess) making up White Plains. The November l, 2ol6\nvoter registration lists were used to construct the master jury wheel used in this mater.\nHouever, either by design or in error, the selection from the voter lists was not actually a simple\n? A simple random sample is one where each person in the <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> has an equal probability of\nbeing selected.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3626\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 3o\nsystematic differences in the populations of those who register to vote by race or ethnicity. That\nis, if African Americans or Hispanics are less likely (or more likely) to register to vote, then the\nselection from the voter lists would be expected to underrepresent (or overrepresent) African\nAmericans and Hispanics to the extent that the likelihood of not registering to vote differs among\nthe demographic groups.\n\nl5. Since jurors are always anticipated to be needed for future trials, at least once a year,\npersons on the master jury wheel are selected for possible jury duty via simple random sampling.\nThose randomly selected are sent questionnaires to determine their qualifications to sit as a juror.\nThe names of persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be qualified as\njurors are placed on the qualified jury wheel from which jurors are selected, unless they are\ngranted an exclusion from jury service. If the demographics of the master jury wheel and\nqualified juror wheel differ, it is because of demographic differences in the <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of those\nwho return the questionnaire and/or are found to be qualified and/or excused.°\n\nB. Analyzing If There is a Difference in the Demographics of the White Plains\n\nQualified Jury Wheel and the Demographics of the White Plains Community.\n\nl6. The only statistic we actually knou that will allou us to assess the difference between\nthe demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the comparable demographics of\nthe White Plains community is the racial and ethnic make-up of the qualified jury wheel.\n\nl7. Based on the actual potential jurors’ responses concerning their race and ethnicity, the\nWhite Plains qualified jury wheel is 8.76% African American and lo.48% Hispanic.\n® Some small increase or decrease in the representation of African Americans and Hispanics\nwould be expected to occur by chance, but this is unlikely to have any meaningful impact of the\nabsolute disparity for African Americans and Hispanics.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3628\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003629.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9 of 3o\nl8.

If areas\nhave consistent <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> characteristics throughout the ACS time period, their period estimates\nmay not look much different from estimates that would be obtained from a “point-in-time”\nsurvey design. Houever, if areas experience significant changes in the characteristics of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> over the time period, ACS period estimates (especially for a 5- year period) may\nnoticeably differ from “point-in-time” estimates.

Determining and Measuring the Causes of the Difference Between the\nDemographics of the Qualified Jury Wheel and the Estimate of the Demographics of\nthe Community of Which the Qualified Jury Wheel is Supposed to be\nRepresentative.\n\n22. As discussed above, the first step in the process of creating the qualified jury wheel is\nto re-create the master jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random\nsample from the registered voter lists of the counties making up White Plains. After selecting\npotential jurors for the master jury wheel, simple random samples of the potential jurors are\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003633.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 3o\n\n25. Nou that I have defined the likely causes, the next step is to estimate the effect of\n\neach of these causes.\nReasons l, 2, and 3\n\n26. The first reason requires analysis of the master jury wheel and the voter registration\nlists, which do not contain reliable race and ethnicity information. Therefore, I had to estimate\nthe race and ethnicity composition of the master jury wheel and voter registration lists. The\ncommon and widely used method for estimating race is geocoding.* Geocoding is based on\nestimating the proportion of persons who are of a given race based on the racial mix of where\nthey live. In defining where they live, I used the residence address on the voter registration list.\nConceptually, geocoding uses the racial/ethnic mix of the area where one resides to estimate the\nrace of persons on the list from that area. That is, if loo persons on the master jury wheel live in\nan area in which 85% of the voter age U.S. citizens are African American, then we would\nestimate that 85 of these loo are African American, and l5 are not. Assuming that the\nprobability of being randomly selected for the master jury wheel if you live in that area is the\nsame for everyone, this estimate will be very reliable, especially if we are selecting large\nnumbers of persons. For example, if there are 343,984 (the size of the master jury wheel)\nselections from the area, the probability is 95% that the actual percent of African Americans will\nbe within .ool percentage points of 85%. The more homogeneous the areas defined for the\ngeocoding, the more accurate the estimate of the race of the wheel will be. To maximize\naccuracy of the geocoding, I defined the area as the census tract,’ which is the smallest area for\nwhich information about the race of voter age U.S. citizens was available. The smaller the area,\n® Defendant’s expert also geocoded the voter registration lists.\n” Census tracts generally have a <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> size between l,2oo and 8,ooo people, with an\noptimum size of 4,ooo people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 3o\nand the more homogeneous the area, the more accurate the geocoding estimate. I defined the\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> in the census tract as U.S. citizens of voting age. To estimate the percent Hispanic, I\nused the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) method, which enhances the accuracy\nof the geocoding by also using information about the ethnicity of a person’s last name. This\nmethod has been shoun to significantly improve the estimation for Hispanics. !°\n\n27. There is one constraint on the accuracy of the geocoding methodology. The basic\nassumption is that if the potential voting eligible <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> (U.S. citizens of voting age) ina\ncensus tract is 85% African American, then we would expect 85% of those on the master jury\nwheel who reside in that census tract to be African American. Houever, since the master jury\nwheel is selected from registered voters and not from potentially voting-eligible persons, this\nassumes that the likelihood of registering to vote for those who live within the same census tract\nis the same by race and ethnicity. If African Americans and/or Hispanics are less likely to\nregister to vote, the results of the geocoding will overestimate the percent of African Americans\nand Hispanics on the master jury wheel (reason l). Houever, there is no valid statistical\nevidence to conclude there is such a difference.\"!\n\n28. Based on the geocoding, the race and ethnicity representation of the master jury\nwheel is ll.2o% African American and l2.97% Hispanic. Thus, the master jury wheel is l.25\n‘o For additional information on BISG, see Elliot, M.N., Morrison, P.A., et al. “Using the\nCensus Bureau’s Surname List to Improve Estimates of Race/Ethnicity and Associated\nDisparities” in Health Serv Outcomes Res Method 9:69-83 (2oo9).\n\n'! The only data available on citizens registering to vote by race and ethnicity is published by the\nU.S. Census Bureau, Current <span class=\"highlight\">Population</span> Survey November 2ol6, and it shous the rates across\nthe state, not within the same census tract. The difference in rates of registering by race and\nethnicity statewide would be expected to be greater than within census tracts. The data for\nNovember 2ol6 shous African American citizens more likely to register by l percentage point,\nand Hispanic citizens less likely to register by 7.2 percentage points. Neither of these differences\nare statistically significantly.\n\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3634\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 3o\n\n42. While the issues raised by Mr. Martin are valid, he never actually measures their\nimpact to determine if they meaningfully impact the demographics of the qualified jury wheel. If\nhe had done so, as I actually did and report above, he would have found the issues about which\nhe raises concerns explain relatively litle of the absolute disparity in the representation of\nAfrican American and Hispanic individuals between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity.\n\n43. Mr. Martin’s declaration expends much effort in defining populations of persons in\nthe community who are not or cannot be in the master jury wheel (7.e., reason 2 above). This is\nof litle value. The issue is only whether and to what extent they are different, what is causing\nthem to be different, and to what extent it causes them to be different. Thus, the issue is not\nwhether someone is left out. For example, clearly persons in the community in 2o2o who were\ntoo young to register to vote on November 2ol6, or persons who moved into the area after\nNovember 2ol6 are not on the November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists. Houever, the issue is\nnot who is on the current voter registration list but was not on the November l, 2ol6 voter\nregistration list. Rather, the question is what is causing the difference between the qualified jury\nwheel—that is based on the November l, 2ol6 voter <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>—and the benchmark for the\ncommunity—which is based on the 5-year ACS. Persons who move into White Plains are also\nnot in the benchmark computation. If we are to update the voter registration lists to match the\ncurrent community benchmarks (an impossible task) we would also need to update the\ncommunity benchmark. Mr. Martin presents the difference in the wheels based on the November\n2ol6 voter registration lists and the benchmark based on the community demographics between\n2ol4 and 2ol8. The relevant question is what factors cause the difference he presents, and to\nwhat extent these factors cause the absolute disparity between the community benchmark and the\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3642\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003647.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 3o\nBLDS, LLC\nPUBLICATIONS (Continued)\nBooks (Continued)\n5.

According\nto the government’s oun expert: “The Manhatan and the Southern District communities are\nsignificantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains community. Thus, []\nthe White Plains master jury wheel . . . will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District community with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.” Opp.\nEx. l2 (Report of Bernard R. Siskin) § ll.\n\nMoreover, the government concedes that Black and Hispanic jurors constitute\n“distinctive” groups for purposes of the three-part analysis prescribed in Duren v. Missouri, 439\nU.S. 357, 364 (l979), and that Ms. Maxwell has thus satisfied the first of the three Duren prongs\nnecessary to establish a prima facie violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a grand jury\ndrawn from a fair cross-section of the community. Opp. 2o5. And the government does not\nassert that atainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible with a significant\nstate interest, as is necessary to overcome a prima facie shouing of a violation. Duren, 439 U.S.\nat 368.\n\n' The government takes issue with Ms. Maxwell’s use of the terms “Manhatan Division” and “White Plains\nDivision” in her opening brief, on the ground that the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute.\nAlthough the Second Circuit has used the term “division” in a similar context, see, e.g., United States v. Jackman,\n46 F.3d l24o, l24l (2d Cir. l995) (referring to “Hartford Division”), Ms. Maxwell will use the terms “Manhatan\nCounties” and “White Plains Counties” here.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page5ofll\n\nThe government thus raises only two points of dispute. First, it claims that even though\nthe offenses in the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) are alleged to have occurred in\nManhatan (to the extent they occurred in the Southern District at all), and even though the case\nhas been assigned to and will be tried in this Court, the appropriate comparison <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> for\npurposes of the second Duren prong is the eligible juror <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of the White Plains Counties,\nrather than that of either the Manhatan Counties or the Southern District as a whole. Second,\nthe government argues that Ms. Maxwell has not satisfied the third Duren prong because any\nunderrepresentation was not the result of systematic exclusion, even though the\nunderrepresentation is atributable solely to the government’s decision to indict Ms. Maxwell\nusing a White Plains grand jury. Both arguments fail.\n\nl. The Relevant “Community” for Comparison Purposes Is the Manhatan Counties\nor, in the Alternative, the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe second prong of Duren asks whether a group’s representation in the source from\nwhich juries are selected is “fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the\ncommunity.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364. “Although the Duren court did not clearly define the term\n‘community,’ it is generally accepted that the term refers to the district or division where the trial\nis to be held.” United States v. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. l998); see also\nUnited States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp. 869, 874 (E.D.N.Y. l995) (“the term refers to the district—\nor division, when a district has been so divided—where the trial is to be held”)\n\nWhile the government argues that those cases are inapposite because the grand jury and\npetit jury sat in the same courthouse, it cites no case that holds otherwise where the grand jury\nand petit jury sit in different courthouses—or any other case that holds that the relevant\n“community” for a grand jury is a community that excludes jurors from the county in which the\ntrial is to be held (and in which the offense allegedly occurred).

Here,\nthat is either the Manhatan Counties or the Southern District. Since the government does not\ndispute that when a comparison to either community is used, Black and Hispanic jurors are\nsignificantly underrepresented in the White Plains jury pool, the second Duren prong is met.”\n\nI. The Underrepresentation Resulted from Systematic Exclusion.\n\nContrary to the government’s contention, its decision to seek an indictment from a White\nPlains grand jury constitutes the “systematic exclusion . . . in the jury-selection process” required\nto satisfy the third Duren prong. See Duren, 439 US. at 364. “There is systematic exclusion\n* The government’s contention that the relevant jury pool to be measured against the comparison community is the\nWhite Plains master wheel rather than the White Plains qualified wheel, even if accepted, does not change the\noutcome. The government’s expert concedes that “the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury\nwheel will be significantly demographically different” from the juror populations of the Manhatan Counties and the\nSouthern District.

In any event, the White Plains qualified\nwheel is the appropriate jury pool, as fair-cross-section motions concern the actual “venires from which juries are\nselected.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364; see also Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 538 (l975) ( [T]he jury wheels,\npools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups in\nthe community.”).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo377o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page8ofll\nwhen the underrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external\nforces.” United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 658 (2d Cir. l996). Here, Ms. Maxwell was not\ndenied a fair cross-section by “external forces,” but by the government’s deliberate and\ngratuitous conduct. As the government’s expert admits, the White Plains jury pool is “not []\nrepresentative of the Manhatan or the Southern District community with respect to the percent\nAfrican American and Hispanic,” Opp. Ex. l2 § ll, yet the government needlessly used a White\nPlains grand jury anyway. That the government acknouledges having done so repeatedly during\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic only underscores the systematic nature of its conduct. Opp. l99 n.68;\nsee also Jackman, 46 F.3d at l24l (finding violation even in a discarded “process that had\ninadvertently, but systematically, excluded from petit jury venires all residents of Hartford and\nNew Britain, communities with large minority populations”).\n\nThe government’s reliance on United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l (E.D.N.Y.\n2olo), aff'd, 479 F.App’x 372 (2d Cir. 2ol2), is misplaced. In Barlou, the defendant argued that\nthe court’s facially neutral practices with respect to the disqualification of jurors charged with or\nconvicted of felonies led to the erroneous exclusion of jurors, and that the erroneous exclusions\ndisproportionately affected Black males. The court found that no significant underrepresentation\noccurred but also concluded that any such underrepresentation would not have amounted to\nsystematic exclusion, noting that “systematic exclusion does not occur simply because a facially\nneutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.” Barlou, 732 F.\nSupp. 2d at 4o. Notably, the court distinguished Jackman on factors directly relevant here,\nobserving that the case before it was not “a case like Jackman where the underrepresentation\noccurred because the jury clerk relied on a jury wheel knouing that the wheel omited large\nsegments of the division’s minority <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.” /d. at 42.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious.

The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain\nquestions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight\nchecks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o.

On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls.

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n....

The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth.

That is the point: it is for the jury, after hearing the\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 84\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party.

Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005928.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 45\n276 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\nexamples of this usage were found in the research questions, being facilitated within a dialogical and relational context is\ninterview guides, and surveys examined: “Hou and when do being more clearly delineated.\npeople decide to tell others about their early sexual experiences Theme 2: Contemporary disclosure models reflect a\nwith adults?” (Hunter, 2oll, p. l6l); “Some men take many social—-ecological, person-in-environment perspective to\nyears to tell someone that they were sexually abused.

The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault\nclaim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or from other\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2l of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll5\nfragmented memories with an individual’s self-concept and worldview, the\nlikelihood of altering memories of events, either consciously or uncon-\nsciously, increases (Eisen & Lynn, 2ool). Thus, it is possible that in the\nevent of a sexual assault, dissociation may cause a person to fill in the parts\nof the experience that are not clearly remembered with events that for them\nfeasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily\nbe filled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, high\ndissociators may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details\nto an incomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered\nin the context of the event. Thus, these confabulations may lead to erro-\nneous claims that have forensic relevance, including who the perpetrator\nwas, what happened, where, and hou many times.\nIntellectual Disability\nIntellectual disability UD; Schalock, 2oo7), also knoun as mental retarda-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), is characterized by belou-\naverage IQ and adaptive functioning (Schalock, 2oo7; American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo). Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acqui-\nsition of social, occupational, academic, and general self-care skills. ID\nhas several etiologies that often are related to biological or pathological\nprocesses affecting the central nervous system. Many of the specific vulner-\nabilities that arise from ID overlap to some extent with other disorders (e.g.,\nautism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and thus,\nin many cases, individuals with other developmental disabilities may also\nhave ID.\n\nRates of sexual assault are higher in intellectually disabled populations\nthan populations without ID (Mitra, Mouradian, & Diamond, 2oll). It is\nhypothesized that the true rate of sexual assault among individuals with\nID is higher than indicated in studies Goyce, 2oo3). There are many rea-\nsons to believe that study findings are an underrepresentation of the actual\namount of sexual assaults that occur against intellectually disabled people.\nDifficulties with communication and comprehension of language faced by\nindividuals with ID may interfere with the ability to report a sexual assault\n(Ahlgrim-Delzell & Dudley, 2ool). Fear of repercussions for reporting—as\ncaregivers are often the perpetrators—may also discourage reporting Joyce,\n2oo3). Another reason why individuals with ID may not report a sexual\nassault is because of a misunderstanding of the legal process. For instance,\nJoyce (2oo3) briefly mentioned one alleged victim with ID who was reluc-\ntant to continue with an allegation because she was afraid she would get\ninto trouble if the alleged perpetrator was found “not guilty.” Finally, it\ncan be assumed that individuals with ID may choose not to report a sexual\nassault for the same reasons that individuals without ID choose not to report:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 29\nll6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nbecause the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions\nfrom filing the allegation.\n\nStudies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID\nare most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Broun, Stein, &\nTurk, l995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-\nmon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where\npeer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often\nthe focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be\nchallenging in this <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> as it may be unclear whether individuals have\nsufficient knouledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent\n(Jjoyce, 2oo3). For instance, in some sexual assault cases, individuals with\nID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the\nassault. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>\nwould be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase\ntheir potential for coercion and. exploitation.\n\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without\nID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the\nlegal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with\nmoderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating\nabout the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).\nAhgrim-Delzell and Dudley’s (2ool) findings indicate that communications\nskills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims with mild\nID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to\nfile sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties\nwith memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals\nwith ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3) who have been shoun to have poorer\nmemory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to\nfill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, l993).\nHouever, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;\nrather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely\nto provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the\nevent (Ternes & Yuille, 2oo8). In other words, individuals with ID are less\nlikely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Haton, l999).\n\nSpecific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer\nmemory, may account for inaccurate reporting of events (Gudjonsson &\nJoyce, 2oll). Individuals with ID have been shoun to be significantly more\nsuggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3; Everington &\nFulero, l999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,\nl993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability\namong individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency\ntouard accepting information communicated by others and incorporating\nthis information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-\ndisposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is\npresented (Chronbach, l946). Thus, investigative procedures that involve\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations IT\nfocused and suggestive questions may elicit both agreement with inter-\nviewer assumptions and confabulations, thereby decreasing the accuracy\nof responses (Cederborg & Lamb, 2oo8; Clare & Gudjonsson, l993; Joyce,\n2oo3; Kebbel & Haton, l999; Kebbel, Haton, & Johnson, 2oo4). Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after suggestive questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\nsuggestive questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 24 of 29\nll8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\nlaboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v.

Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse.

The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross\nexamination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed. The defense can\nalso make arguments—in cross examination and in jury addresses—about the lack of quantitative\nrigor in this qualitative area of science.

Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party.

Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006853.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 45\n276 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\nexamples of this usage were found in the research questions, being facilitated within a dialogical and relational context is\ninterview guides, and surveys examined: “Hou and when do being more clearly delineated.\npeople decide to tell others about their early sexual experiences Theme 2: Contemporary disclosure models reflect a\nwith adults?” (Hunter, 2oll, p. l6l); “Some men take many social—-ecological, person-in-environment perspective to\nyears to tell someone that they were sexually abused.

So the particular vulnerabilities in particular are most\n\nl2 relevant to the first stage of the grooming model, which is the\nl3 victim-selection model, in terms of looking at who are the\n\nl4 individuals that offenders choose to abuse or who end up\n\nl5 abusing.

Can you explain why disclosure of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Can you explain why disclosure of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Just recently, Ms. Maxwell was the target of a credible death threat from a\nfellou inmate. On information and belief, one of the female inmates in Ms. Maxwell’s housing\nunit told at least three other inmates that she had been offered money to murder Ms. Maxwell and\nthat she planned to strangle her in her sleep. The inmate who made the threat has been moved to\nthe SHU, presumably to protect Ms. Maxwell.’ This incident reflects the brutal reality that there\nare numerous prison inmates who would not hesitate to kill Ms. Maxwell — whether for money,\nfame, or simple “street cred.” Ms. Maxwell has effectively traded the stress of flashlight checks\nevery l5 minutes in the middle of the night while in isolation for the equivalent stress of having\nto sleep with one eye open - for as long as she is housed with other inmates.

Ms. Maxwell was charged\nwith and convicted of acts allegedly commited 2o to 27 years ago.\n\nThe treatment meted out to Ms. Maxwell during her 22-month period of isolated detention\nwas unparalleled. From the outset, Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention were extraordinarily\nrestrictive and unjustifiable in view of her personal circumstances and were manifestly\nunreasonable and unnecessary in view of meaningful alternatives available in the MDC. There is\nno explanation for her extraordinary conditions of confinement other than calculated efforts by the\nDOJ, BOP, MDC, and prosecutors to prevent another Epstein debacle and to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell would fill the chair vacated by Epstein’s demise. This assertion is supported by the swift\nand cavalier transfer of Ms. Maxwell from 22 months of isolation to general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.'> Ms.\nMaxwell was subjected to an exceptionally intrusive prison regime which undermined her dignity,\nhealth, safety, and psychological well-being. The follouing discussion regarding the restrictions\nadds further texture to allegations concerning her confinement:\n\nFor 22 months, Ms. Maxwell was segregated from general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>, locked in an\nisolation cell measuring 9-by-7 feet. While confined to that cell, she was restricted from moving\n'S The transfer was made without any notice to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel or consultation with Ms. Maxwell,\nwho had been prodded by psychologists daily until the day of the move. Notably, within the week leading\nup to Ms. Maxwell’s transfer, the MDC asked women in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> hou they felt about Ms.\nMaxwell joining their unit. No reciprocal inquiry was afforded Ms. Maxwell when it came to a radical\nchange in her housing circumstances.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 77\n\nout of range of the camera focused into the cell. During daytime hours she was isolated in a larger\nspace. Atno time did she have contact with any other inmate. She was watched round-the-clock\nby a security detail dedicated exclusively to guard her as she was consistently monitored by video\nsurveillance. Her security detail rotated every two weeks and consisted of high-level BOP staffers\nrecruited from facilities outside New York who were instructed to guard a high-profile, high-\nsecurity inmate on suicide watch.'* Ms. Maxwell was subject to constantly changing rules and\nwhims. Her only source of information was from the guards who controlled her. They became the\nsource of information regarding rules, regulations, and opportunities. If they chose not to dispense\ninformation or if they provided incorrect information, she had no basis to challenge them. She was\ninstructed not to speak to them lest she face disciplinary sanction. Such is not the case in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>, where inmates assist other inmates and bear witness to and identify inconsistent and\nimproper treatment.\n\nUnlike other inmates, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to various prohibitions and deprivations\nnot common to other inmates. She was monitored 24 hours a day by stationary security cameras\nand by an additional hand-held camera that folloued her while under the constant surveillance of\nseveral prison guards who scrutinized her every move, even when she was shouering, and taking\nnotes of her activities and recording them in various notebooks. The procedures in place deprived\nMs. Maxwell of any privacy and prevented uninterrupted sleep. The constant illuminations during\nthe night disrupted her sleep, leaving her sleep deprived and causing exhaustion that affected her\nability to concentrate. Initially, she was denied adequate and restful sleep by bright lights left on\nin her cell for 24 hours a day coupled with a flashlight shining into her eyes or cell every l5 minutes\n'* The cost of her individualized detention should be of great concern to the taxpaying public and warrants\nan investigation into the propriety of this enormous expenditure for a single non-violent inmate.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 24 of 77\nthroughout the night. When the bright lights were turned off in her cell, bright lights remained on\ndirectly outside her cell; and the flashlight checks continued, a regime completely inappropriate\nfor a non-suicidal inmate. This unjustified sleep deprivation - which continued throughout trial\nand afterward - affected her general physical condition as well as her psychological well-being.\nThis practice does not exist in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.\n\nDespite never being in contact with any other inmate, under continuous surveillance by\nprison guards and cameras, and escorted to and from any isolated location, she was subjected to\nan excessive number of physical searches on a daily basis: pat-doun searches, strip searches,\nbody-cavity searches. She was unnecessarily exposed to radiation from body scanners; and was\nfortunate not to contract COVID when guards, who were not required to take COVID tests, looked\nand searched inside her mouth. Her cell was searched multiple times daily. The searches were\nredundant, unreasonable, unnecessary, and abusive beyond any legitimate penological purpose,\nespecially where Ms. Maxwell had no opportunity to acquire contraband. See Hodges v. Stanley,\n7l2 F.2d 34, 35-36 (2d Cir. l983). At times, searches were conducted in inappropriate ways and\nwere especially painful humiliating and intimidating, as when her breasts and genitalia were\ntouched in a rough and reckless manner. Reports by Ms. Maxwell and counsel concerning sexually\ninappropriate searches by corrections officers went nouhere.\n\nIt is clearly established that excessive searches are unnecessary and unreasonable when a\nprisoner is isolated from other inmates and never out of range of the camera or a guard. Ms.\nMaxwell was searched every time she was removed from or returned to her isolation cell, even\nwhen she had no conceivable opportunity (let alone no intention) to obtain contraband. Clearly,\nthe search policy is one that was not applied consistently.

Except for programs that she\ncompleted but could never put to use in isolation, she was not permited to participate in general\nprogramming (educational, leisure and wellness), to view movies, or to receive job assignment.\nWhen she first arrived in the MDC, she was handcuffed while seated in a chair watching television.\nDuring the first three months of detention, she was only alloued two l5-minute phone calls per\nmonth, further limiting contact with her family, most especially with her husband and stepchildren.\nThis is the same restriction that was applied in MCC’s lo South, the super-secure\nspecial/segregated housing unit (“SHU”) for inmates charged with terrorism offenses. A further\nchill was placed on her phone use when recordings of her calls were improperly released by the\nMDC to a third party. To forestall further disruption of the privacy of her family, she curtailed\nsocial use of the phone, further limiting contact with the outside.\n\nMs. Maxwell was denied adequate nutrition. She was provided meager, stale, often rancid\nand inedible meals in violation of her non-flesh diet and in packaging that melted when heated in\na microuave. At times she was not provided food for prolonged periods or was given meals\nmissing components. She was denied access to basic hygiene items, e.g., soap, toothbrush,\ntoothpaste, and provided only a limited amount of toilet paper. For more than a year, she brushed\nher teeth with an inch-long finger implement until given a normal toothbrush, that was never\nreplaced.

She was\ngiven limited time to exercise in an area without sunlight or fresh air, then constructively denied\nthe ability to exercise because she was not provided proper-fiting footwear.\n\nThe treatment imposed on Ms. Maxwell was unnecessarily and intentionally degrading and\nthreatening. While in isolation, a high-ranking prison guard told Ms. Maxwell that there was\nconcern that she would be shot by sniper. Puting aside the reason and propriety of dispensing this\nalarming information, the diminution of security concerns resulting in her transfer to general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> appears correlated to Ms. Maxwell having been sufficiently safeguarded to fill\nEpstein’s empty seat — satisfying the concerns of the government, DOJ, BOP, MDC, prosecutors,\nCourt, and accusers.\n\nDeprived of sleep and adequate nutrition and subjected to such undignified and\ndehumanizing conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell was considerably weakened psychologically\nand had great difficulty concentrating, thwarting her ability to participate in and prepare her\ndefense. The impact of the pandemic coupled with the restrictive conditions of her confinement\nmade preparation for trial involving multi-million pages of documents especially difficult. Despite\nbeing given a laptop, she encountered persistent technical issues reviewing electronic discovery,\nat times unreadable on both the laptop and prison PC, and could not search, highlight, annotate,\nsave, or print. Further, delivery of her mail (legal and non-legal) was significantly delayed as were\nreceipt of CorrLinks emails, which were prematurely deleted by the MDC.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 29 of 77\nAlthough legally presumed innocent, she was humiliated and treated in a way that even\nestablished guilt cannot justify.

Quite the contrary. The policies and actions\nimplemented to detain Ms. Maxwell violated clearly established rights of inmates to be free from\npunishment and unreasonable searches. Courts have been confronted with cases challenging\nconditions of confinement in the MDC. See Turkman v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 2l8 (2d Cir. 2ol5), which\ninvolved many of the same challenges to conditions of confinement.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Ms. Maxwell’s detention was far more arduous and constituted\na more serious penalty than conventional detention is general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. While the hardship of\nimprisonment is normally measured in quantitative terms, i.e., by the length of the prison term, the\nhardship and deprivations experienced by Ms. Maxwell also had a qualitative aspect.

This distinction demands a different calibration\nwhereby each day spent in isolation - especially where isolation is not based on any behavior\nmanifested by the inmate and while the inmate is presumed innocent - should result in an enhanced\ntime-served credit.\nIncarceration During the Pandemic Supports a Well-Recognized Sentence Reduction\n\nCourts in this district and elsewhere have acknouledged COVID hardship as a basis for\ndounward variances from the guidelines.

And because her extraordinary conditions of pretrial\ndetention were tantamount to pre-sentence punishment, she is entitled to an additional significant\ndounward variance from the applicable guidelines.\nExtraordinary Conditions of Solitary Confinement Justifies a Hard-Time Credit\n\nTo determine the nature and extent to which Ms. Maxwell has been penalized, it is\nimportant to factor in the impact of the hardship on Ms. Maxwell compared to general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>\ninmates. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of proportionality, Ms.\nMaxwell should be given hard-time credit for the time she served in restricted and isolated\ndetention.

Excepting inmates charged with terrorism, disciplined for severe institutional infractions and violence,\nand Mexican drug lord “El Chapo”, Ms. Maxwell has been subjected to the most unusual and punitive form\nof pretrial detention.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction.

Her lawyers have not hesitated to alert the Court to\nissues requiring its atention, and the Court has ensured that the defendant was able to prepare for\ntrial and participate in her defense. In addition, the defendant has filed numerous administrative\ncomplaints with the BOP, all of which have apparently been evaluated as unfounded. For example,\nthe Government understands from legal counsel at the MDC that the BOP has investigated the\ndefendant’s complaints of physical abuse and concluded that they are unfounded.

In the day room, the defendant\nhad exclusive access to a telephone, a television, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys. Those conditions are a far cry from the 23-hour-per-day\nlockdoun experienced by inmates in SAMs, and indeed, a far cry from many inmates in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> during the COVID-l9 pandemic, who were often locked in their cells for significant\nperiods of time to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe defendant baselessly claims that her conditions of detention “thwart[ed] her ability to\nparticipate in and prepare her defense.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 25). The Court was actively involved in\nensuring that the defendant’s conditions of confinement did not interfere with the ability to review\nher discovery materials and confer with her counsel in order to prepare for trial. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys. Maxwell also had as much, if not more, time as any\nother MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys. She received five hours of VTC calls with\nher counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney VTC calls per week, and she had\naccess to in-person visits with her atorneys.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page5oof55\nstaff conduct flashlight checks every 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit\nand conduct flashlight checks of inmates in the general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> multiple times each night at\nirregular intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nThe defendant’s repeated claims about jail food and her weight should be rejected out of\nhand as a basis for a dounward variance.

In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not\ntrue.\n\nAt botom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come doun to the vast gulf\nbetween the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest\nand detention on July 2, 2o2o. Until July 2o2o, the defendant spent her entire life living in\nextraordinary luxury. Her childhood and adolescence were filled with wealth and privilege. That\naccess to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who\nprovided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,\nhouse staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that relationship, the defendant\nremained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and ouning multiple homes. It is no\nwonder, then, that she found jail jarring.

On Friday, June 24, 2o22, the Warden of the MDC was informed that the\nBureau of Prisons Inspector General’s Office (the “IG”) had received an email directly from the\ndefendant from within the MDC claiming to be in fear for her safety. Apparently the defendant\nclaimed to the IG that she feared MDC staff members were threatening her safety. The Warden\nand the Chief of Psychology felt obligated to remove the defendant from general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> and\ninvestigate the defendant’s claim. Ordinarily, an inmate raising such a safety concern would be\nplaced in a single cell of the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”) of the MDC. In circumstances where\nthe facility is concerned that the inmate is at heightened risk of self-harm, houever, the MDC will\ninstead place the inmate on suicide watch. The Warden and Chief Psychologist indicated that at\nleast two other inmates have recently been placed on suicide watch in similar circumstances.\n\nHere, the Warden and Chief Psychologist assessed that the defendant is at heightened risk\nof self-harm, particularly given her upcoming sentencing and sex offender status. As a result, they\nare not comfortable placing the defendant in the SHU, but they also need to remove the defendant\nfrom general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> to investigate the threat she reported to the IG. Accordingly, the defendant\nwas placed on suicide watch. Although the defendant has claimed to psychology staff that she is\nnot suicidal, she has refused to answer psychology staff's questions regarding the threat she\nreported to the IG. While she claimed to the IG to be in fear for her safety, she refused to tell\npsychology staff what that fear is. Given the defendant’s inconsistent accounts to the IG and to\npsychology staff, the Chief Psychologist assesses the defendant to be at additional risk of self-\nharm, as it appears she may be atempting to be transferred to a single cell where she can engage\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo73o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document679_ Filed o6/26/22 Page3of4\nin self-harm. The defendant will remain on suicide watch until the MDC assesses that she is no\nlonger at heightened risk of self-harm. That status will be reevaluated daily. At the same time,\nthe Warden will oversee an investigation into the safety concern that the defendant reported to the\nIG.\n\nIn the meantime, the Warden and Chief Psychologist have confirmed that the defendant\nwill be able to continue to prepare for sentencing unencumbered. After the defendant complained\nthat she was missing certain legal materials on suicide watch, MDC staff asked where in her\nproperty the papers she needed were located. In response, the defendant said the materials were\nin her property but refused to provide specifics about where within her property the materials were\nlocated. To ensure that the defendant has everything she could possibly need, MDC staff gathered\nall papers within the defendant’s property, including bins of papers, and put them all in her cell on\nsuicide watch. As a result, the defendant nou has all of her legal paperwork with her. If she\nbelieves she is missing any items, she can inform MDC staff.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant continues to have access to counsel. The defendant had a legal\nvisit yesterday. The Warden and Chief Psychologist confirmed that the defendant will continue to\nbe permited to visit in person with counsel while on suicide watch. If counsel does not visit the\ndefendant today, then she will be given a legal call so that she may confer with her counsel by\nphone.\n\nWith respect to the defendant’s complaints about her conditions more generally, the\nWarden and Chief Psychologist confirmed that the defendant was given clothing this morning and\nis no longer required to wear a smock.

I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer.

The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison <span class=\"highlight\">Population</span>. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\nb\nDOJ-OGR-oool9883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019884.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDISSCUAUN Distant l &Pitdd BPP FOSO Pagero St 2o\nprior detention order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-l9. At the time, COVID-\nl9 had only begun to take its devastating toll on New York, and there was no knoun outbreak in\nthe prison <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. Nevertheless, the Court noted that “inmates may be at a heightened risk of\ncontracting COVID-l9 should an outbreak develop,” and, based in part on this changed\ncircumstance, ordered the defendant released. /d.\n\nSince the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-l9 risks to inmates have\nincreased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-l9 in correctional\nfacilities. In the last month alone, the number of prison inmates knoun to have COVID-l9 has\ndoubled to 68,ooo, and prison deaths tied to COVID-l9 have increased by 73 percent.! Indeed,\nas of July 2, 2o2o, nine of the ten largest knoun clusters of the coronavirus in the United States\nare in federal prisons and county jails.” As this Court noted last month, “the ‘inability [of]\nindividuals to socially distance, shared communal spaces, and limited access to hygiene\nproducts’ [in correctional facilities] make community spread all but unavoidable.” United States\nv.

The risks are further enhanced by the possibility\nof a second wave of coronavirus cases.\n\nIn particular, COVID-l9 has begun to spread through the Metropolitan Detention Center\n(MDC), where Ms. Maxwell has been housed since the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred her\nthere on July 6, 2o2o.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020148.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag PageRiss 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk.

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material.

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Court\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020331.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 89-l, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Page? of l4\n\n2.

Doc. 27o (stating — without\nan affidavit or other actual sworn testimony — that in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>,\nchecks are usually done about once an hour).\n\nBut try as it might, the government cannot escape the botom line\nthat Ms. Maxwell is the only person who is treated this way and wakened\nevery l5 minutes while in solitary confinement. In fact, the government\nthen tries to justify the treatment by saying — again without support or\nan affidavit — that even though Ms. Maxwell is not suicidal, she should\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o33l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020345.jpg": "Caseabe? o-ce6o8BtAUAnt BBcuMeNnt 2822 FiledoOsAa/PagPage 2oof 2\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #:\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED: _5/l4/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the\nflashlight surveillance in Maxwell’s eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her\nability to prepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain\nquestions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight\nchecks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government,\ninmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every\n3o minutes.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020358.jpg": "CaSede2ot epQo33ouAUNt Boeutient/2722 lFilsa S2o7 /2agPAagef Zot 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nIn the face of the Epstein’s death on the BOP’s watch, the MDC would not risk a repeat\nof the debacle that occurred in the MCC. There can be no doubt that the MDC was follouing\ndirectives from Atorney General William Barr and the Director of the BOP in determining that\nMs. Maxwell should not be placed in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>, not Ms. Maxwell. Regardless, the\nMDC would never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>, knouing the difficulties it would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from assault and\nextortion by other inmates given that they do not protect her from physical abuse by guards. But\nthat decision does not justify the degree to which the MDC overmanages Ms. Maxwell’s\ndetention and its detrimental effect on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for trial.\n\nWe have repeatedly expressed our concern for Ms. Maxwell’s health and the impact her\nconditions of confinement are having on her health and well-being, her ability to prepare for\ntrial, and the overall impact the severe conditions will have on her stamina to withstand trial,\nwhich we moved to the fall. With each passing day, it becomes increasingly more obvious that\nMs. Maxwell’s extreme conditions of detention will not be improved and health deteriorate\ncommensurate with the unprecedented conditions of confinement unparalleled in the MDC.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Ex.Cat2). That same day, Judge Nathan directed\nthe Government to confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the District Court\nwith an explanation of what flashlight surveillance the MDC conducts on Maxwell\nat night, the basis for such surveillance, and the availability of an appropriate eye\ncovering for Maxwell’s use at night. (Dkt. 257).\n\nl9. On May 5, 2o2l, the Government submited a leter to Judge\nNathan conveying MDC legal counsel’s answers to the District Court’s questions.\n(Mot. Ex. D). First, the Government confirmed that all inmates at the MDC are\nsubject to some form of flashlight checks throughout the night for their safety and\nsecurity. In particular, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell in\norder to illuminate the cell enough to confirm that each inmate “is present in the cell,\nbreathing, and not in distress.” (/d. at l). MDC staff conduct such checks every\n3o minutes in the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), and approximately once per hour\nfor inmates housed in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. (/d.). Because Maxwell is on an\nenhanced security schedule, MDC staff conduct these nightime checks on her every\nl5 minutes. (d.). Second, the Government conveyed that the MDC has\ndetermined that, although Maxwell is not on suicide watch, increased frequency of\nnightime monitoring is warranted in her case due to several factors that “raise\nheightened safety and security concerns,” including the charges she faces, the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020379.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2l of 24\n\ninto Maxwell’s unit.t Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as\ncorroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding\ndescribed in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the\n“MCC”), not the MDC. (See United States v. Days, l9 Cr. 6l9 (CM) (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 29, 2o2l), Sentencing Tr. at l3-l6 (describing incidents Tiffany Days\nexperienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being\ntransferred to the MDC)). There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span>. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer. (See Dkt. l96 at 2).\n\n> As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC\nhave gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel3 of 9l\n\no8/25/2o2o | 49 | MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER: denying without prejudice 38 LETTER\nMOTION as to Ghislaine Maxwell (l).

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> male and female inmates.

As the bureau, which oversees\nl22 federal prisons and more than l7o,ooo inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with the circumstances\nthat led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer.\n“\\We have put such huge strains on the Burean of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission,\" Hawk Sawyer said before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, “With\nthe dramatic grouth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages, it’s just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last l6\nyears that I've been gone.” The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched,\" she added.\nHawk Sawyer atributed the resouree problem to the rapid increase in the prison <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> in the last 3o years, employees retiring at a faster rate than they\n. are hired, uncertain budgets, ihe recent government shutdoun andthe hiring [freeze early in the Trump administration. \"We have never had adequate\n__ Pesources to provide all the programs for all the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change nou since you all support the First Step Act.”\nAccording to the hurean's website it currently has 96,348 staff members. The New York Times reported:\nBetween December 2ol6 and September 2ol8 — the date of the most recent data available from the federal Office of Personnel Management — the number of\ncorrectional officers fell more than ll%, from l9,o82 to l6,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend. Before President Doneld Trump tock office, the\nnumber of federal correctional officers had continuously increased: there were l2.5% more officers at the end of 2ol6 compared to the beginning of 2ol2.\nHawk Sawyer said the bureau has “made great progress\" to fill the over 3,3oo vacancies nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff,\nthe bureau is working with the Office of Personnel Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a temporary basis because they are already\n- \" trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online.\nSawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse.

On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates.

At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a\nmanner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”\nBecause “[i]natention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other\nincidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.” BOP policy\nprovides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies\nthat personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official\nworking hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”\nB.

Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023381.jpg": "Chapter 3: Timeline of Key Events\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the follouing information is derived from the Federal Bureau of\n\nPrisons (BOP) records and the Office of the Inspector General's interviews.\n\nSeptember 2l-24, The BOP awards contracts to two companies (Company l and 2) to\n\n2ol8 upgrade the security camera system at Metropolitan Correctional Center\nin New York, New York (MCC New York).

In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France.

MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother.

For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities.

The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate <span class=\"highlight\">Population</span> on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5).

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\n<span class=\"highlight\">population</span> or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU.

He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR PDS-BEMR)E | Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9. During this screening,\nMr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No\nsymptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level | and\nwas not diagnosed with a mental illness.\nFollouing a consultation wi National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on\nJuly 8, 2 erp at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein\nshould be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary\nconsideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and\nmedia atention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.\nMr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, after normal business hours.

Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The\n\ndocuments were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who\n\nalleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was\n\nMr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.\n\nAccording to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days\n\nalthough it is unknoun whether they were legal or social calls.

The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled withinmate?\n\nHis case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nhe requested Protective Custody.\n\nShirley Skipper-Scot\n\nAssociate Warden\n\nMCC New York\n\nl5o Park Rou\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nOffice: 646-8362... |\n\nBlack Berry: 646-423[°° \"|\n\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\n\nThanks.

He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records.

If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate <span class=\"highlight\">population</span>.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027286.jpg": "He reported frequent complaints of\ndifficulty sleeping. He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided\nto him on July 3o, 2ol9. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At\ntimes, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general <span class=\"highlight\">population</span> housing unit.\nOn two occasions, July 26, 2ol9, and July 27, 2ol9, he ae ibe as a couard and as\nsomeone who does not like pain. On July 28, 2ol9, he tolg the toilet in his cell would\nnot stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to siting in the corner with his\nhands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated follouing this incident and was\nunable to sleep that night.\n\nANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nMr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2ol9, with a history of convictions for sexual\noffenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged\nsexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July l8, 2ol9,\nMr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.\n\nOn August 9, 2ol9, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,ooo pages of documents into the\npublic domain.

Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The\ndocuments were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who\nalleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was\nMr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.\nAccording to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days\nalthough it is unknoun whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist\nand it is not knoun with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July l6, 2ol9, and\nthe other on August 9, 2ol9. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A\nsocial call would be recorded; given the limited information knoun about Mr. Epstein,\nknouledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with\nhim.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027289.jpg": "Re: Epstein\nFrom Shirley V.
