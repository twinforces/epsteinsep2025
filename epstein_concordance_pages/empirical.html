Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions.

Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 8 of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\n<span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5875", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page4ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span>\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished.

The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations.

At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page5ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J.

Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span>\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span>\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6 of 29\n\nloo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo3\n\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations\nas either knouingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information\nprocessing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that\na coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally,\nsome psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to\nfabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be\nbelieved are the positive consequences of a false report.\n\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> inves-\ntigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo5\nIn this situation, the controversy is not whether sexual content occurred but\nwhether consent for this sexual content occurred.\n\nThe final level of complexity regarding this pathway occurs in the\natempt of professionals involved in the case to accurately understand after\nthe fact the details of whatever consent process did or did not take place.\nBy its nature, this will generally be a “he said, she said” mater in which it is\nvery difficult to resolve conflicting claims. Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2o of 29\n\nll4 J. Engle and W. O’Donohbue\n\nbetween reports of childhood trauma and high levels of dissociation (e.g.\nSanders & Giolas, l99l). Dissociation can occur either during the trau-\nmatic experience (peritraumatic dissociation) or afterward (postraumatic\ndissociation). Peritraumatic dissociation is characterized by numbness,\ndetachment, derealization, depersonalization, and reduced responsiveness\nduring the traumatic event (Tichenor, Marmar, Weiss, Metzler, & Ronfeldt,\nl996). A meta-analysis comparing the results of 35 <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> studies on the\nrelationship between levels of peritraumatic dissociation and postraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) found that peritraumatic dissociation was a moderate\npredictor of PTSD (Breh & Seidler, 2oo9).\n\nSome psychologists have conceptualized dissociation as a coping mech-\nanism in response to trauma-related stress (Gershuny & Thayer, l999).\nHouever, others have argued that dissociation is a trait that precedes a trau-\nmatic experience and may contribute to psychological responses in trauma\nsurvivors (Tichenor et al., l996). Whatever the case may be, dissociation\nhas been shoun in multiple studies to be related to memory fragmentation\n(Kindt, Van den Hout, & Buck, 2oo5; van der Kolk & Fisler, l995) and to two\nprominent correlates: fantasy proneness (Merckelbach, Campo, Hardy, &\nGeisbrecht, 2oo5) and absentmindedness (Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &\nHorselenberg, 2ooo).\n\nIn one study (Candel et al., 2oo3), lou and high dissociators were read\nstories of a traumatic nature and asked to freely recall the story. Even after\ncontrolling for fantasy proneness, high dissociators provided more errors of\ncommission—that is, added false content—than lou dissociators, though\nthe two groups did not differ on errors of omission. In another study\nby Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt,\n2oo2), participants were read a story and asked to recall the content of\nthe story. They were then asked several misleading questions meant to\ntest suggestibility. As hypothesized, participants who were high dissocia-\ntors were more likely to endorse story elements that were fabricated than\nlou dissociators. Also, participants who were high dissociators were also\nmore likely to have trait absentmindedness but were not more likely to have\nfantasy proneness. Similar studies have shoun a small trend touard a rela-\ntionship between fantasy proneness and memory commissions (Giesbrecht,\nGeraerts, & Merckelbach, 2oo7). The results of these studies indicate that\ndissociators are capable of “remembering” events that did not happen and\nthat absentmindedness may be a mediator in the relationship between trau-\nmatic events and commission errors of memory. The results of these studies\nsuggest that it may be important to consider the possibility that the mem-\nory of the event may include false details if the claimant has high levels of\ndissociation.\n\nA review of the literature on dissociation and memory (Giesbrecht,\nLynn, Lillienfild, & Merckelbach, 2oo8) cited evidence that trait dissociation\nis likely to be associated with memory distortions.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions.

Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6796", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\n<span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 43oofl58 43\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A.

Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span>\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true.

Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true.

Dr. Dietz may\ntestify that Dr. Rocchio’s definition runs the risk of suggesting that innocent conduct is grooming\nand that the label “grooming” carries within it a subjective judgment of an alleged perpetrator’s\nintent. These opinions, when limited to a criticism of Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming,\nbolster Dr. Dietz’s opinion that grooming does not have a setled definition and is hard to\nmeasure. They are therefore relevant and admissible opinions.\n\nBut the Court will preclude any opinion testimony that there is inadequate evidence of an\nintent to groom as applied to Ms. Maxwell. In particular, Dr. Dietz’s disclosed opinions that\nthere is not “adequate evidence of either’ motive or intent, that grooming imputes intent “to the\nDefendant,” and that “there is considerable risk of misleading the fact finder” into finding intent,\nall suggest that Dr. Dietz would testify that there is inadequate evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s intent.\nNotice at 3 (emphasis added). Testimony to that effect would plainly violate Rule 7o4(b). The\nCourt therefore precludes these three aspects of Dr. Dietz’s opinion as well as any other\ntestimony that would similarly go beyond criticizing Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming and\ninstead suggest that there is inadequate evidence of intent in this case.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that there is not <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> data on whether minors with particular\nvulnerabilities are more likely to be targeted by perpetrators of sexual abuse. /d. at 4.

It therefore admits this opinion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l76", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagellofl7\ntestimony for a permissible purpose, the Court finds a substantial risk that jurors will instead use\nDr. Dietz’s testimony to evaluate the credibility of witnesses before them. This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible relevance that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\nsubstance abuse that “can affect memory and recall.” Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defense’s case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defense’s position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56—57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as irrelevant, as\nneedlessly cumulative with Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about substance abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietz’s last opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists\neleven “pathways to false sexual assault allegations,” which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and intellectual disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Gov’t Br., Ex. C (“Pathways Article”). The Government argues that this\ntestimony should be excluded because it is not based on reliable methods, it involves lay topics\nwithin the ken of the jury, and it does not fit the facts of the case. Gov’t Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietz’s opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but\nprovides no <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span> basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel2ofl7\n(“Further research is needed into the frequency of these pathways ....”). Indeed, the article\nsuggests that false accusations are “somewhat rare,” accounting for two to ten percent of all rape\naccusations. /d. at lol. By contrast, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are drawn both from <span class=\"highlight\">empirical</span>\nstudies and from her forensic and clinical experience. She stated, for example, that the\n“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at 87, l5l. In its response\nbrief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false\nallegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at l2. But that assertion is “merely the statement\nof counsel . . . unaccompanied by any citation.” Tchatat, 3l5 F.R.D. at 446. Dr. Dietz’s lengthy\nsummary of his expected pathways testimony makes no reference to his oun experience. And\neven if he did reference his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain hou that experience\nprovides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false\naccusations. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4).\nBecause the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its\nburden of proof under Rule 7o2. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 592 n.lo.\n\nSecond, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false accusations falls within “the ken\nof the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d\n57, 72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse accusations. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:l6-CV-oo2o6, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at\n*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2ol8) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in child abuse cases\nhave a motive to lie”).\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point. When cross-\nexamined by Defense counsel, Dr. Rocchio agreed that “many reasons,” including “outright\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010705.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Pagel4of2l\n\nIt is well knoun that being a crime victim inflicts numerous immediate psychological\ntraumas on victims as well as those close to them.

See Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels, THE USE OF VICTIM\nIMPACT STATEMENTS IN SENTENCING OF SEXUAL OFFENSES: STORIES OF STRENGTH (2o2l).
