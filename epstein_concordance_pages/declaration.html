The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss\nthe perjury counts stemming from her answers to\nquestions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends\nthat these charges are legally deficient because the\nquestions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and\nthe questions were not material to the subject of the\ndeposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately\nleft to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal\npenalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court ... knouingly makes any false\nmaterial <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony\nis perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is\nmaterial to the proceeding in which the defendant\noffered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous\nto support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a\nwitness believe that their testimony is false. United\nStates v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a\ngeneral mater, “[a] jury is best equipped to determine\nthe meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific\nquestion.” Id. Courts have acknouledged a narrou\nexception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them\ncannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also United\nStates v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous only if reasonable\npeople could not agree on its meaning in context.\nLighte,'782 F.2d at 375. The existence of some arguable\nambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against\na witness who understood the question.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000148.jpg": "85a\ndefendant of due process of law simply because it did\nnot produce the evidence sooner.” Id. at l44.\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate\ndisclosure of all Brady and Giglio material and also\nrequests a few specific documents she contends the\nGovernment has failed to disclose. The Court begins\nwith the specific requests. The requested materials\ninclude (l) records of witness interviews in connection\nwith an ex parte <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted\ncopy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a personal\ndiary that is in the custody of a civilian third party;\nand (4) copies of all subpoenas the Government has\nissued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation\nin this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of\nits Brady obligations, that is has reviewed the witness\ninterviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither\nset of documents includes exculpatory information not\npreviously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt\nthe Government’s representation in this case that it is\naware of its Brady obligations and that it has complied\nand will continue to comply with them. And because\nthe witness statements are covered by the Jencks Act,\nthe Court cannot compel production of such statements\nunder the terms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo;\nCoppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted\ncopy of the other requested FBI report, and so that\nrequest is moot. The diary pages she requests are\nwithin the control of a civilian third party, not the\nGovernment, and so the Government need not (and\nperhaps cannot) produce them. See United States v.\nCollins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9).\nFinally, Maxwell’s request for copies of all subpoenas\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000150.jpg": "87a\nagreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six\nweeks in advance of trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request\nfor a hearing to determine the admissibility of co-\nconspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements\nmay often be admited at trial on a conditional basis.\nIf the Court determines that the Government has not\nmet its burden to shou that the conditionally admited\nstatements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting in-\nstruction or, in extreme cases declare a mistrial.\nUnited States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir.\nl993). Although conditional admissions can pose a\nproblem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here be-\ncause the Government has commited to producing co-\nconspirator statements at least six weeks in advance\nof trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.\nMaxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the\nGovernment’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority\nto compel pretrial disclosure of the identity of\ngovernment witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528\nF.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975). In deciding whether to\norder accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts\nconsider whether a defendant has made a specific\nshouing that disclosure is “both material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of\nthe circumstances surrounding the case.” United\nStates v. Bejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l89-l4o (2d Cir. l99o)\n(cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the\nGovernment must produce a witness list reasonably in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000161.jpg": "98a\ncommunity control, and he registered as a sexual\noffender with the Florida Department of Law\nEnforcement. After victims and news media filed suit\nin Florida courts for release of the copy of the NPA that\nhad been filed under seal in the state court file, a state\njudge in September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple\ncivil lawsuits brought against him by victims seeking\nmonetary damages, including the two petitioners in\nthe CVRA litigation. During the CVRA litigation, the\npetitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which\nmade substantial document productions, filed lengthy\nprivilege logs in support of its withholding of documents,\nand submited declarations from the AUSA and the\nFBI case agents who conducted the federal investiga-\ntion. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various\nrecords, as did Epstein, who was permited to intervene in\nthe litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless,\nthe court ultimately ordered that substantial records\nrelating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public.

Intervenor has witnessed the\nsame patern of political/ judicial corruption at work in his oun case; and has nou identified the same\nconspiracy at work in this case.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\ne intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2ol2/2ol3,\nintervenor filed a whistleblouer complaint with the Washington State Auditor’s Office. The\ncomplaint was escalated to Michael Horouitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A\nCase l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span>). OIG refused to investigate the\ncomplaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges\nthat Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered\nthat State of Washington concealed this information so that “Democrats” and Republicans could\nlaunder $7o billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through |\nintervenor’s atorneyz.\n\ne On l2/27/l9, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the\nFalse Claims Act, seeking $l billion in damages and qui tam bounty against “Democrats”,\nRepublicans, and his former atorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> (first 2 pages only)).\n\ne On5/l/l3, USDO! submited a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor’s claim (See EXHIBIT C Case\nl:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span>), falsely stating that intervenor’s allegations\n“lack sufficient factual and legal support.”\n\ne oOn5/l3/l9, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against Bill Barr and other USDOJ atorneys\nfor conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span>).\n\ne On5/l4/l9, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct.,\nafter fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case l:l9-CR-\noo49o-RMB hereby atached by <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span>).\n\nDAVID GOLDEN\nl5l5l NW MASON HILL RD\nNORTH PLAINS, OR 97l33\nMOTION TG INTERVENE - 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo634", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000635.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document5l- Filed o8/27/l9 Page 3of4\n® On 5/l5/l9, Intervenor had his petition for quo warranto against USDOJ for fraud/ obstruction/\nperjury dismissed as “moot” (See EXHIBIT F Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by\n<span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span>}.\n© On6/6/l9, intervenor identified the conspiracy (the same conspiracy at work in this case) to the\nDistrict Ct.

The transcript\nquotes the court, in pertinent part, as follous with reference to me and the article: “On a somewhat more\nserious note, don’t quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is :\nhimself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I’m\ncertain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal.” Later in the :\nhearing, atorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court.\nJust to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate\nor to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, in\nsupport of Professor Dershouitz’s motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. :\nDershouitz, l:l9-cv-o3377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as “Epstein- /\nrelated.” My work as an expert witness, which concluded in June, did not involve my representation of, :\nor advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershouitz.

If extradition is refused solely on the basis of the nationality of the person sought, Article\n3(2) requires the requested State to submit the case to its authorities for prosecution, if\nso requested by the requesting State.\n\n58. Consequently, the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA does not\ncontain any prohibition on the extradition of nationals. Instead, it merely states that\nthere is no obligation upon the requested State to grant the extradition of a person who\nis one of its nationals.\n\n59. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA must therefore be distinguished\nfrom several international agreements on extradition ratified by France, which, by\ncontrast, contain a clear rule against the extradition of French citizens*?.\n\n6o. For example, France has made the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> pursuant to Article 6 of the\nEuropean Convention on Extradition l957, which gives Contracting States “the right to\nrefuse extradition of nationals”:\n\n“Extradition shall be refused when the person sought had French nationality at the time\nof the alleged offence’.\n\n6l. Therefore, France does not surrender French citizens under the European Convention on\nExtradition”.\n\n62. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA is similar to other international\nagreements signed by France which also do not contain a prohibition against the\nextradition of nationals. These are generally treaties signed with Common law\njurisdictions, which do not oppose the extradition of their nationals*’.\n\n3° See, for example, the Extradition treaty between France and Morocco, or the Extradition treaty between France\nand China.\n3! See France’s instrument of ratification of the European Convention on Extradition, deposited on lo February\nl986.\n32 The European Convention on Extradition l957 is an instrument of the Council of Europe which was signed in\nParis on December l3, l957 and came into force on April l8\", l96o. The European Convention on Extradition\nis open to signature by non-Council of Europe States, as such it was ratified by South Africa, Israel, and the\nRepublic of Korea. It was ratified by France on February lo\", l986.\n33 For example, the Extradition Treaty between France and Canada, signed in Otawa on l7 November l988,\ncontains a similar provision to the United States Treaty: “The requested State shall not be bound to extradite its\noun nationals. Nationality shall be determined as of the date of the offence for which extradition is requested”\n(Article 3).\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l8\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 22 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n73. The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a principle of constitutional value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the international conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental principle\nrecognized by the laws of the Republic, having constitutional value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the principle against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French constitutional\nlaw, European law or international law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\nConclusion\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the procedure described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77.

Offenses are “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of\nrelated transactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996). By contrast,\noffenses are not “connected” and joinder is inappropriate when “[c]ommission of one of the\noffenses neither depended upon nor necessarily led to the commission of the other; proof of the\none act neither constituted nor depended upon proof of the other.” Halper, 59o F.2d at 429.\n\nSimilarly, offenses that are separated by time and location, and were allegedly commited\nunder different circumstances, are not sufficiently connected to warrant joinder.

Such cases typically involve situations where the defendant was aware that he\nwas being investigated and either lied to the grand jury or made false statements to law\nenforcement officers in an effort to thwart the existing investigation into the other offenses with\nwhich he was charged. See, e.g., id. at 789-9o (joinder of perjury, false statements, and\nobstruction of justice counts proper where defendant made false statements to FBI agents and\nperjured himself in the grand jury); see also id. at 79l (collecting cases).\n\nHere, the circumstances are very different and joinder is not appropriate. The\ngovernment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell lied to the grand jury or the FBI to derail its\ninvestigation into the conduct underlying the Mann Act Counts. Instead, it alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements in two depositions in an unrelated civil defamation action which\noccurred in April and July 2ol6. Moreover, although the government alleges that some of the\nquestions posed at the depositions related to some of the alleged victims in this case (Indictment\n{| 2, 8), the questions were tangential to the defamation action, which was based on Ms.\nMaxwell’s denial of a purported conspiracy with Epstein from l999-2oo2 involving Ms. Giuffre.\nThe alleged false statements underlying the Perjury Counts therefore do not “concern” the Mann\nAct Counts and cannot be joined as part of a “common scheme or plan.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at\n79l.\n\nThe government makes only a half-hearted, and ineffective, atempt to allege a\nconnection between the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a).\nParagraph 2 of the Indictment alleges:\n\n[I]n an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned\n\nabout her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described\n\nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2ol6.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo229o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 7 of l3\nreturn the questionnaire (and who are found to be qualified as jurors). /d., Art. lV.A.

Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997)\n(emphasis omited).\n\nTo be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable\nof influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it is addressed.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (quotation marks omited). When made during a civil\ndeposition, statements are material only if “a truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to\nlead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit.” United States v.\nKross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994). In proving materiality, it “is necessary . . . that the\ngovernment shou that the statement, if believed, could have influenced the decision” of the\ndecision-making body. United States v.

R. Crim. P. l2(b). See United States v. Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo). Here, the deposition transcripts and Judge Preska’s\nruling provide the Court with the relevant undisputed facts to decide this motion.

Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the procedure enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\nproffered as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document l82-l Filed o3/26/2l Pageiofl\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nCase No. 2o-CR-33o-AJN\nVv.\n<span class=\"highlight\">DECLARATION</span> OF SIGRID S.\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL MCCAWLEY IN SUPPORT OF\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\nee\nI, Sigrid S.

Rajaratnam, No. o9 Cr. ll84 (RJH), 2olo WL 48674o2, at *l8\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2olo). The defendant fails to identify the standard that would govern such a\nhearing. In light of the interests implicated by a Title III wiretap, the USAO-SDNY submits that\nthe defendant’s depositions in a civil mater, even with a protective order, are no more significant\nthan the interests implicated by a Title III wiretap. As such, the exacting standard of Franks should\napply. On this record, the defendant has not made a threshold shouing that the Government acted\nwith the intent to mislead or in reckless disregard for the truth.

Mot. 4, Ex. H at 9). “That knouledge,” the Court explained, “goes directly to the truth or\nfalsity of the alleged defamation, a key element of Plaintiffs claim.” (/d.). The Court therefore\nordered the defendant to answer the questions related to her sexual activity with or involving (l)\nEpstein, (2) Giuffre, (3) underage girls knoun to Epstein or who she thought might become knoun\nto Epstein, or (4) involving massage with individuals the defendant “knew to be, or believed might\nbe, knoun to Epstein.” (/d. at lo). The Court further ordered the defendant to answer questions\nabout her knouledge of the sexual activities of others in the same four categories. The Court added\nthat the “scope of Defendant’s answers are not bound by time period, though Defendant need not\nanswer questions that relate to none of these subjects or that is clearly not relevant.” (/d.). The\ndefendant sat for a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6, before the case setled.\n\nAs discussed more fully belou, the Indictment charges the defendant with two counts of\nperjury, one arising from statements made during the April 2ol6 deposition and one arising from\nstatements made during the July 2ol6 deposition.

The defendant nou moves to dismiss\nboth counts, arguing that the Court can effectively decide nou, as a mater of law, that the questions\nwere fundamentally ambiguous, her answers were true, and her answers were immaterial to the\ncase.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nSection l623(a) imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a).\nIn perjury prosecutions, “whether the witness believes that an answer is true or false generally\nturns on the declarant’s understanding of the question.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372\n(2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, and as is true of virtually all factual issues, “[a] jury is best equipped\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003100.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 239\nF.2d at 929). Offenses may be joined “where the same evidence may be used to prove each count\nor if the counts have a sufficient logical connection.” United States v. Page, 657 F.3d l26, l29\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (internal quotation marks and citations omited). “For purposes of analysis under\nRule 8(a),” houever, “no one characteristic is always sufficient to establish ‘similarity’ of offenses,\nand each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v. Blakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d\nCir. l99l) (internal quotations and citations omited). For instance, in United States v. Werner,\n62o F.2d 922 (2d Cir. l98o), the “Second Circuit found sufficient similarity between two cargo\nthefts that occurred two years apart and only one of which was violent in nature,” because “both\noffenses arose out of [defendant’s] scheme to use his position as an insider . . . to obtain money or\nproperty carried by it.’” United States v. Smith, No. o5 Cr. 922 (DLC), 2oo7 WL 98o43l, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 2oo7), aff'd, 348 F. App’x 636, 638 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (first alteration in original)\n(quoting Werner, 62o F2d at 927).\n\nJoinder is also proper for “distinct criminal acts where they originated from a common\nscheme.” United States v. Ying Lin, No. l5 Cr. 6ol (DLI), 2ol8 WL 5ll3l39, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. l9, 2ol8) (citing Werner, 62o F.2d at 927). Specifically in the context of perjury, “[t]he law\nin this circuit clearly supports the joinder of underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts\nwhere, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.” United States v. Potamitis,\n739 F.2d 784, 79l (2d Cir. l984); see United States v. Sweig, 44l F.2d ll4, ll8 (2d Cir. l97l).\nFalse statements can “concern” or be connected with substantive offenses even if they were not\nmade as part of an investigation into the specific substantive conduct. See United States v. Ruiz,\n894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir. l99o) (joining false statements on loan applications with perjury about\n“atempts to secure Senate Ethics Commitee approval” of “consulting fees’); United States v.\nBroccolo, 797 F. Supp. ll85, ll9o-9l (S.D.N.Y. l992) (joining fraud counts with a false statement\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3loo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 239\nconsciousness of guilt, such as false exculpatory statements, may also tend to prove knouledge\nand intent of a conspiracy’s purpose ... .” (internal quotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nSecond, the offenses are logically connected and are part of the same common plan or\nscheme. It is setled law in this Circuit that joinder of “underlying substantive crimes with perjury\ncounts” is appropriate “where, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.”\nPotamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l; see also United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol (2d Cir. l992) (same). In\nRuiz, the defendant was a New York state senator who founded a nonprofit that was developing a\nmall in the Bronx, and for which he provided consulting services. In l984 and l985, he made two\nloan applications for funds to invest in the project, on which he made false statements. /d. at 5o3-\no4. In l986, the defendant also lied about his possession of a leter from the Senate Ethics\nCommitee to a grand jury that was investigating his consulting activities for the nonprofit. /d. at\n5o3. He was charged with two counts of false statements on the loan applications and one count\nof perjury, and he moved to sever the perjury charge. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that, although the “alleged perjury did not occur during a specific investigation by the\ngrand jury into the alleged bank fraud,” the statements nonetheless “‘concerned the defendant’s\nscheme to maximize his personal gain from the [project], as well to cover any improprieties that\nscheme might involve.’” Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (quoting United States v. Ruiz, 7o2 F.\nSupp. lo66, lo76-77 (S.D.N.Y. l989)) (emphasis omited). And the Second Circuit affirmed,\nexplaining that the counts had “sufficient logical connection” because they all “relate to [the\ndefendant’s] extra-senatorial activities through the [nonprofit],” and therefore were “part of a\ncommon scheme or plan.” Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5. So too here: the defendant’s perjury did not\noccur in the context of a grand jury investigation into the same sexual offenses charged in the\nIndictment, but the statements concerned those offenses and sought to conceal the defendant’s role\n\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of 348\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriffs work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ...

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an ‘“‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3386", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*°!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*° Houever, in a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims. I knew that State charges had nothing to do with me.\nao Dan Mangan, ““Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,” New York\nPost, Oct. l, 2oo7.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”° In her 2ol7 CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Whether we were required or not.” Sloman also\ntold OPR that while “we didn’t think that we had an obligation to send them victim notification\nleters... I think... Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off” sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?° The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span>: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”°°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\n\nA48 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”\nane Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, 4lol June 6, 2ol7).\n\n23o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3432", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 258 of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims,\nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list. Villafafia recalled\nthat Reiter told her that he would “try to contact as many as he could” and that he would destroy\nthe list afterwards. Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\nidentified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\nvictims.”>°?\n\nIn her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”3>*\nIn her 2oo8 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”* In her 2oo8\n<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n453 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n334 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n2o8 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**! Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence.

Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\n\n368 Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3437", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.*! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3476", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3477", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 2\nCe: \"StanPotinger@aol.com\" <StanPotinger@aol.com>, \"brad@pathtojustice.com\"\n<brad@pathtojustice.com>\nSubject: Virginia Guiffre\nAmanda,\nThank you again for meeting with us today.

The population for which the jury is meant\nto be representative is normally defined as the population of citizens of the United States who are\nat least l8 years old who reside in the community. To the extent there is a difference in\nrepresentation between the qualified jury wheel and the community of African Americans or\nBlacks (referred to herein as African Americans) and of Hispanics or Latinos (referred to herein\nas Hispanics), I was asked to assess the cause(s) of the difference. I also was asked to comment\non the appropriateness and accuracy of the defendant’s expert Jeffery Martin’s assessment of the\ndifference between the qualified jury wheel and the community.\n\nWW. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n3. The African American percentage of the White Plains qualified jury wheel was 3.69\npercentage points louer than that in the White Plains community (8.76% versus l2.45%,\nrespectively) and the Hispanic percentage was 3.64 percentage points louer than that in the\nWhite Plains community (lo.48% versus l4.l2%, respectively). This is consistent with what\nDefendant’s expert Mr. Martin reports in his <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>.\n\n4. The disparities were almost exclusively due to the patern of African Americans and\nHispanics having been sent a juror questionnaire, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused at a significantly louer rate than other races or ethnicities after returning the\nquestionnaire. Of the 3.69 percentage point difference by race (African American), 2.58 (or\n69.9% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor. Of the 3.64 percentage point difference\nby ethnicity (Hispanic), 2.59% (or 7l.2% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor.\n\n5.

Mr. Martin also compared the qualified jury wheel for White Plains with the\nManhatan community and for the overall Southern District community. The White Plains\nmaster jury wheel is designed to be representative of the White Plains community, not the\nManhatan or Southern District community. The Manhatan and the Southern District\ncommunities are significantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains\ncommunity. Thus, since the White Plains master jury wheel is designed to be representative of\nthe White Plains community, by design it will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District community with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.\n\nIV. DATA RELIED UPON\n\nl2. The data I received and relied upon is listed in Appendix B of this <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>.\nV. FINDINGS\nA. Overview of Qualified Jury Wheel Selection Process.\n\nl3. The master jury wheel which forms the basis for the qualified jury wheel for the\nWhite Plains community of the Southern District of New York is supposed to be drawn via a\nsimple? random sample from the voter lists from the six counties (Westchester, Putnam,\nRockland, Orange, Sullivan and Dutchess) making up White Plains. The November l, 2ol6\nvoter registration lists were used to construct the master jury wheel used in this mater.\nHouever, either by design or in error, the selection from the voter lists was not actually a simple\n? A simple random sample is one where each person in the population has an equal probability of\nbeing selected.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3626", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 3o\n\n42. While the issues raised by Mr. Martin are valid, he never actually measures their\nimpact to determine if they meaningfully impact the demographics of the qualified jury wheel. If\nhe had done so, as I actually did and report above, he would have found the issues about which\nhe raises concerns explain relatively litle of the absolute disparity in the representation of\nAfrican American and Hispanic individuals between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity.\n\n43. Mr. Martin’s <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> expends much effort in defining populations of persons in\nthe community who are not or cannot be in the master jury wheel (7.e., reason 2 above). This is\nof litle value. The issue is only whether and to what extent they are different, what is causing\nthem to be different, and to what extent it causes them to be different. Thus, the issue is not\nwhether someone is left out. For example, clearly persons in the community in 2o2o who were\ntoo young to register to vote on November 2ol6, or persons who moved into the area after\nNovember 2ol6 are not on the November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists. Houever, the issue is\nnot who is on the current voter registration list but was not on the November l, 2ol6 voter\nregistration list. Rather, the question is what is causing the difference between the qualified jury\nwheel—that is based on the November l, 2ol6 voter population—and the benchmark for the\ncommunity—which is based on the 5-year ACS. Persons who move into White Plains are also\nnot in the benchmark computation. If we are to update the voter registration lists to match the\ncurrent community benchmarks (an impossible task) we would also need to update the\ncommunity benchmark. Mr. Martin presents the difference in the wheels based on the November\n2ol6 voter registration lists and the benchmark based on the community demographics between\n2ol4 and 2ol8. The relevant question is what factors cause the difference he presents, and to\nwhat extent these factors cause the absolute disparity between the community benchmark and the\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3642", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003650.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 3o\nAPPENDIX B\nSDNY_ JA oooool BronxCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooooo2 DutchessCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo749 ManhatanCounty\nSDNY_JA_ ooo75o OrangeCounty\nSDNY _JA_ooo75l PutnamCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo752 ROCKLAND COUNTY VOTERS ll32ol2\nSDNY _JA_ooo753 RocklandCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo754 SullivanCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo755 WestchesterCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo756 JMS Wheel 5 NYC\nSDNY_JA_ooo757 JMS Wheel 5 WP\nSDNY_JA_ooo758 Qualified JMS Wheel 5 NYC\nSDNY_JA_ooo759 Qualified JMS Wheel 5 WP\nSDNY_JA_oooll6-oool2o Item 8 Statistical or Demographic analyses Source List Race Gender\nReport\nMemorandum Of Law In Support Of Motion To Dismiss The Indictment As It Was Obtained In\nViolation Of The Fifth And Sixth Amendments To The United States Constitution And In\nViolation Of The Jury Selection And Service Act\n<span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> of Jeffrey Martin dated November 9, 2o2o\nSupplemental <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> of Jeffrey Martin dated November 2o, 2o2o\nThe defense used data as of November l, 2ol6:\nhtps://www.elections.ny.gov/EnrollmentCounty.html\nNYSVoter Enrollment by County, Party Affiliation and Status\nVoters Registered as of November l,\n2ol6 htps://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/county/county_novl6.pdf\nDOJ-OGR-oooo365o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003695.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 34\nMoreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “‘in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Jd. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3695", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 34\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to\ndisclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003731.jpg": "CasGAss-4/2956o9o33o-PAR umbocument 2o8:4 on FilehO4/262 b4/cPagey Odds 6 of lo\n\nJane Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA” (id. at 3); and “The Government was\nwell aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it listed her as a victim in the\natachment to the NPA” (id. at 6).

As the Court has taken it upon itself\nto strike the impertinent factual details from the Rule 2l Motion and related filings, the Court\nconcludes that Mr. Derschouitz’s intervention in this case is unnecessary. Accordingly, his\nmotion to intervene will be denied as moot.’ Regarding whether a shou cause order should\n\n* This also moots Mr. Dershouitz’s Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply in\nSupport of Motion for Limited Intervention.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe MDC leter, dated April 28, 2o2l, submited in response to the Court’s memo-\nendorsed order to shou cause (Dkt. 249), fails to address the concerns raised in my April 26\"\nleter. The Court should summarily deny the MDC’s request and require it to respond to the\nspecifics in the Court’s order.\n\nThe claim that “[d]Juring Ms. Maxwell’s legal visit, staff noted she was in receipt of\ndocuments that were handed to her by the atorneys” does not justify the confiscation and review\nof Ms. Maxwell’s confidential legal documents. Any documents which “Ms. Maxwell was in\nreceipt” were documents that Ms. Maxwell brought to the visiting room. Counsel did not hand to\nMs. Maxwell any documents that did not originate from Ms. Maxwell. Further, it was after Ms.\nMaxwell called counsel to report that her documents were seized and counsel, in turn, informed\nMs. Maxwell that a complaint would be made that MDC staff contacted legal counsel.\n\nOnce again, the Court is provided second-hand information from the MDC. Ms.\nPapapetru was not present during the legal visit, does not claim to have reviewed the video\nrecording of the legal visit, and failed to provide any helpful or reliable information (either by\nway of an affidavit or <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> or a copy of the recording) to rebut the claims before the\nCourt. A recycled reporting of the guards’ inaccurate observation is an inadequate response to a\nsignificant problem. The MDC has failed to offer any legitimate, fact-based explanation for\nviolation of Ms. Maxwell’s 6 Amendment rights. The Court should disregard the MDC’s\nresponse and order the relief requested on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.\n\nConsidering the MDC’s atempt to cast the conduct of its staff in a positive light while\ncasting aspersions on Ms. Maxwell and counsel, we request that the Court direct that the guards\nresponsible for the inappropriate seizure be summoned to Court and a copy of the video\nrecording be provided to defense counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285-3 Filed o5/2o/2l Page3of3\nCe: \"StanPotinger@aol.com\" <StanPotinger@aol.com>, \"brad@pathtojustice.com\"\n<brad@pathtojustice.com>\nSubject: Virginia Guiffre\nAmanda,\nThank you again for meeting with us today.

As noted in\nour previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision of the NPA stands in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is\nexpressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt. 223 at 9-lo). The broad language of the co-conspirator\nprovision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his atorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFL, that\nhe would be “the only one who takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR Report at l67\n(internal quotations omited)). Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal “to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability,” which is set forth in the factual recitals of the\nNPA. (Ex. B at 2 of 7; see also Ex. D § 5 (<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> of AUSA A. Marie Villafafia noting that\nEpstein “sought a global resolution of the mater”). Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware\nthat the investigation had extended beyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses.\nIndeed, we nou knou from discovery recently produced by the government that the government\ninterviewed at least three New York-based witnesses in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation, two of whom implicated other potential co-conspirators of Epstein. (Exs. E-G).\nHence, these provisions of the NPA reflect Epstein’s desire to ensure that he would not become\nembroiled in subsequent prosecutions of his “potential co-conspirators” in any other districts.\n(Dkt. 223 at ll).\n\nMoreover, this result is consistent with fundamental fairness.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA.

On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004508.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ll of 349\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- oooo45o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 228 of 349\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 235 of 349\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°? Houever, in a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4534", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 242 of 349\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Whether we were required or not.” Sloman also\ntold OPR that while “we didn’t think that we had an obligation to send them victim notification\nleters... I think... Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4539", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?

One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\nidentified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\nvictims.”°>?\n\nIn her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”°\"4\nIn her 2oo8 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”**° In her 2oo8\n<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n453 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n334 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n2o8 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**4 Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing.

Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4598", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and .. . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4599", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o3 of 349\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 8o\ncomplete intent to bind the Commonwealth that anything Cosby said in the\n\ncivil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing him to be deposed\n\nand perhaps testify in a civil trial without him having the ability to “take the\n\n5th” | decided to create the best possible environment for [Constand] to\n\nprevail and be compensated.

Castor’s public decision not to prosecute Cosby, the\nCommonwealth charged Cosby with three counts of aggravated indecent assault’?\nstemming from the January 2oo4 incident with Constand in Cosby's Cheltenham\nresidence. On January ll, 2ol6, Cosby filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus‘?\nie By this time, Mr. Steele had replaced Judge Ferman as District Atorney. See l8\nPa.C.S. § 3l25(a)(l), (a)(4), and (a)(5).\n\ni Cosby styled the petition as a “Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Motion to\nDisqualify the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office.” The trial court treated the\nomnibus motion as three separate motions: (l) a motion to dismiss the charges based\nupon the alleged non-prosecution agreement; (2) a motion to dismiss the charges based\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo483l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 8o\nCosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his Fifth\nAmendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing\nhim to sit for a deposition under oath. ...

The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject\nto suppression.\nMs. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by leter of September 25,\n2ol5, requesting a copy of the “writen <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>” indicating that [Cosby]\nwould not be prosecuted.

In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not prosecute Cosby.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First Assistant District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the Commonwealth or anyone representing [Cosby] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[Cosby] would never be prosecuted. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution. Ms. Troiani had not receive any prior\nnotification of the decision not to prosecute.\nMs. Constand and her atorneys did not request a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> from Mr.\nCastor that [Cosby] would not be prosecuted. Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[Cosby] atempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [Cosby] asserted the Fifth\nAmendment, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider. Ms. Constand and her counsel had no\nreason to request immunity.

Castor never, in\nfact, reached an agreement with Cosby, or even promised Cosby that the Commonwealth\nwould not prosecute him for assaulting Constand. T.C.O. at 62. Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the interaction between the former district atorney and Cosby to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court\nnoted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s\nimmunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947.4 Per the terms of the statute,\na The immunity statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in\n\nall proceedings before:\n\n(l) Courts.\n\n(b) Request and issuance.--The Atorney General or a district atorney\n\nmay request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and\n\nthat judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the Atorney\n\nGeneral or district atorney:\n\n(l) the testimony or other information from a witness may be\nnecessary to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide\nother information on the basis of his privilege against self-\nincrimination.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 44 of 8o\nuse of the same with the [prior bad acts] witnesses, were essential to resolving the\notherwise he-said-she-said nature of [Constand’s] allegations.” /d. The Superior Court\nadded that the trial court did not err in determining that the probative value of this evidence\noutweighed its potential for unfair prejudice, inasmuch as, “in a vacuum, Cosby’s use and\ndistribution of a then-legal ‘party drug’ nearly half a century ago did not appear highly\nprejudicial,” and “only becomes significantly prejudicial, and fairly so, when, in the context\nof other evidence, it establishes Cosby's knouledge of and familiarity with central nervous\nsystem depressants for purposes of demonstrating that he was at least reckless” in giving\nConstand such a drug before having sexual contact with her. /d. at 42o-2l (emphasis in\noriginal) (cleaned up). The court added that any potential for unfair prejudice was\nmitigated substantially by the court’s cautionary instructions, and that, accordingly, there\nwas no error in the admission of this evidence. /d. at 42l.\n\nTurning to Cosby’s claims relating to the enforceability of the non-prosecution or\nimmunity decision rendered by then-District Atorney Castor, the Superior Court viewed\nthis as a challenge to the denial of a motion to quash a criminal complaint, which would\nbe evaluated under an abuse-of-discretion standard. /d. at 4lo. Like the trial court, the\npanel found no “authority suggesting that a district atorney ‘may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> as the sovereign.” /d. at 4ll (quoting\nT.C.O. at 62). Therefore, the court opined, “it is clear on the face of the record that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there was no enforceable non-\nprosecution agreement in this case.” /d. The court added: “Even assuming Mr. Castor\npromised not to prosecute [Cosby], only a court order can convey such immunity. Such\npromises exist only as exercises of prosecutorial discretion, and may be revoked at any\ntime.” /d.

My name is Stephen Gillers. | am a law professor at New York University School of ,\nLaw, where I have taught the rules and law governing lawyers and judges (“legal ethics’’)\n: regularly since l978. ] am author of a leading casebook in the field, Regulation of Lawyers:\n. Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll.

My name is Stephen Gillers. | am a law professor at New York University School of ,\nLaw, where I have taught the rules and law governing lawyers and judges (“legal ethics’’)\n: regularly since l978. ] am author of a leading casebook in the field, Regulation of Lawyers:\n. Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll.

And soon the sex overcame everything else. Sarah described the\nEpstein/Maxwell quid pro quo as the “Hotel California;” you can check-out any time you like, but\nyou can never leave.\n\nBoth VISs provide relevant background information regarding Maxwell’s character and\nconduct. Both statements further describe that for many years after finally extricating themselves\nphysically from the Epstein/Maxwell trap, they suffered serious mental and physical illnesses.\nElizabeth discusses numerous hospitalizations for mental breakdouns and being unable to hold\ndoun a job. After being a victim of Maxwell’s conspiracy crimes, Sarah atempted suicide twice, both\ntimes ending up in the hospital with serious physical injuries.\n\nBoth Sarah and Elizabeth have submited VISs to the probation office for inclusion in the\nPresentence Investigation Report. See <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> of Robert Y.

Formation and Development of the EVCP\nIn November 2ol9, the co-executors of Epstein’s estate (the “Epstein Estate”) sought\napproval from a U.S. Virgin Islands court (where the Epstein Estate is being probated) to create a\nvoluntary claims resolution program for victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse.” The program’s\ndesign was led by Ms. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg, and Camille S. Biros—all nationally\nrecognized claims-administration experts.* Mr. Feinberg is the nation’s leading expert in\ncrafting effective dispute resolution alternatives, and, with Ms. Biros, they have designed and\n' Ex.

The Critical Importance of Confidentiality to the EVCP and Similar Programs\n\nMs. Feldman’s <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> explains why confidentiality is so critical to programs like the\nEVCP.”’ As she notes, “it can be incredibly difficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such\ndeeply personal, intimate, private information about their experiences and the impact it has had\non their lives,” and many victims “suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in\npositions of authority.”°° The EVCP sought to create an environment where claimants did not\nfeel a need to “censor themselves” about their experiences.*! Creating that environment simply\nwould not be possible without strong assurances of confidentiality. As expressed to Ms.\nFeldman by victims’ atorneys and victims themselves, “many victims were initially reluctant to\nparticipate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express assurance of\nconfidentiality.”*?\n\nAny intrusion on that promise would threaten the foundation of the program. As Ms.\nFeldman explains, “[c]ompromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very\nfoundation and fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims.”*?\nCompelling the EVCP to disclose the information it promised to keep confidential would be\n“anathema to the integrity of this Program and others like it” and “would turn the Program on its\nhead with far-reaching consequences to this victim population and beyond”—meaning for the\nEVCP and the viability of other past, existing, and future litigation-alternative victim\ncompensation programs.*4 Ms. Feldman is unaware of any other instance in which an\n9 See Ex.

In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections.

On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket.

If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. ‘The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. /d. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020788.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7o of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 34\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to\ndisclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is m the custody ofa civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020789.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o789", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020939.jpg": "Ca - ..

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021345.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel73 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\n\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].””°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.7'©\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021384.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo. 3536o38, Page2l2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted.\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n#9o In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021401.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 397 3536o38, Page229 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA. The Case Agents and Villafaia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021408.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 334 3536o38, Page236 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”°”!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°” Houever, in a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°° In her 2ol7 CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n2o8 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021415.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34l 3536o38, Page243 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.**? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she ‘“‘was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.**° In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021933.jpg": "; Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document8 Filed ll/l9/l9 Page 2 of lo\n. : Page 2\n’ AO 98 (Rev. l2/ll} Appearance Bond |\n—————————_—_—_—_—_——— oo SS i\nRelease of the Bond. ‘The court may order this appearance bond ended at any time.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\nBs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... Itis\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023183.jpg": "and guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!>\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.7!°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims ....\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.jpg": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023239.jpg": "government informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea.

And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.””* She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023246.jpg": "involved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, ‘“[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°* Houever, in a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*% Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n3o5 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23248", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023253.jpg": "in Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!” Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . .. and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n3l6 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23253", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023259.jpg": "“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\nPa The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n328 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl28 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.

One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.

The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**4 Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXII. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafaia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n363 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\n\n364 Villafaia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23273", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023312.jpg": "agent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Wild stated that she “‘was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nFBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\n\n32 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n274\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023313.jpg": "the federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘2S As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023314.jpg": "not plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n485 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030146.jpg": "<span class=\"highlight\">DECLARATION</span> FOR METROPCS RECORDS\nSecurity Compliance bic -8\n8l44 Walnut Hill Lane\nSuite 8oo\nDallas, Texas 7523l\nb6 -3\nRe: CASE NO: 3lE-MM-lo8o62 b7c -3\nTARGET NUMBER:;|_ b3 -l\nY | hereby declare: b6 -8\nb7c -8\nI am employed by MetroPCS Inc. and have been designated as Custodian of Records with responsibility for\nMetroPCS’ compliance with the subpoena duces tecum, search warrant or court order.\nThe atached records are true copies of all the records described in the legal process (subpoena, search warrant, or\ncourt order), I personally have conducted or supervised compliance by MetroPCS with the subpoena duces tecum,\nsearch warrant or court order.\n; The records are either call detail or subscriber records, employee records, or other wireless records, depending upon\n| the legal process (subpoena duces tecum, search warrant, or court order) request.\nThe subscriber records were prepared by MetroPCS personnel in the ordinary course of business at or near the time\nof the act, condition, or event.

The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss\nthe perjury counts stemming from her answers to\nquestions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends\nthat these charges are legally deficient because the\nquestions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and\nthe questions were not material to the subject of the\ndeposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately\nleft to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal\npenalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court ... knouingly makes any false\nmaterial <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony\nis perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is\nmaterial to the proceeding in which the defendant\noffered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous\nto support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a\nwitness believe that their testimony is false. United\nStates v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a\ngeneral mater, “[a] jury is best equipped to determine\nthe meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific\nquestion.” Id. Courts have acknouledged a narrou\nexception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them\ncannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also United\nStates v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous only if reasonable\npeople could not agree on its meaning in context.\nLighte,'782 F.2d at 375. The existence of some arguable\nambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against\na witness who understood the question.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000148.tif": "85a\ndefendant of due process of law simply because it did\nnot produce the evidence sooner.” Id. at l44.\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate\ndisclosure of all Brady and Giglio material and also\nrequests a few specific documents she contends the\nGovernment has failed to disclose. The Court begins\nwith the specific requests. The requested materials\ninclude (l) records of witness interviews in connection\nwith an ex parte <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted\ncopy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a personal\ndiary that is in the custody of a civilian third party;\nand (4) copies of all subpoenas the Government has\nissued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation\nin this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of\nits Brady obligations, that is has reviewed the witness\ninterviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither\nset of documents includes exculpatory information not\npreviously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt\nthe Government’s representation in this case that it is\naware of its Brady obligations and that it has complied\nand will continue to comply with them. And because\nthe witness statements are covered by the Jencks Act,\nthe Court cannot compel production of such statements\nunder the terms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo;\nCoppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted\ncopy of the other requested FBI report, and so that\nrequest is moot. The diary pages she requests are\nwithin the control of a civilian third party, not the\nGovernment, and so the Government need not (and\nperhaps cannot) produce them.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so.

Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ...

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.tif": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span> in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023239.tif": "government informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA.

In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.””** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims ....

Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023246.tif": "involved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, ‘“[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°? Houever, in a <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*% Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n3o5 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23248", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023253.tif": "in Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . .. and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n3l6 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23253", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023259.tif": "“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’  Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2. The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?8 The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">Declaration</span>: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\n327 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8.

Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span>, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in.

[and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n433 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023314.tif": "not plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.° In her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 <span class=\"highlight\">declaration</span> that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030146.tif": "<span class=\"highlight\">DECLARATION</span> FOR METROPCS RECORDS\nSecurity Compliance bic -8\n8l44 Walnut Hill Lane\nSuite 8oo\nDallas, Texas 7523l\nb6 -3\nRe: CASE NO: 3lE-MM-lo8o62 b7c -3\nTARGET NUMBER:;| b3 -l\nY | hereby declare: b6 -8\nb7c -8\nI am employed by MetroPCS Inc. and have been designated as Custodian of Records with responsibility for\nMetroPCS’ compliance with the subpoena duces tecum, search warrant or court order.\nThe atached records are true copies of all the records described in the legal process (subpoena, search warrant, or\ncourt order), I personally have conducted or supervised compliance by MetroPCS with the subpoena duces tecum,\nsearch warrant or court order.\n/ The records are either call detail or subscriber records, employee records, or other wireless records, depending upon\n| the legal process (subpoena duces tecum, search warrant, or court order) request.\nThe subscriber records were prepared by MetroPCS personnel in the ordinary course of business at or near the time\nof the act, condition, or event.
