There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shous\nthat the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts. Instead, where\nthe NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the\nSouthern District of Florida.

Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only\nwhere subsequent charges are “sufficiently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier\nagreement. In Annabi, this Court rejected an interpretation of a prior plea agreement that\nrested on the Double Jeopardy Clause, reasoning that even if the Double Jeopardy Clause\napplied, the subsequent charges were “sufficiently distinct” and therefore fell outside the\nClause’s protections.

As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for detention.

No question about it. Maxwell knous\n\nwhere a lot of the bodies are buried. If I was somebody who had participated in\n\ntheir sex trafficking, um, I would not be sleeping easily tonight.\n\nBoies: I think that [the accusers] want to see her go to trial. On the other hand,\n\nthe arrest and conviction that would come from a plea deal is an enormous step\n\nand I think they also <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell did not act alone.\n\nThere are lots of other people that need to be brought to justice.\n\nMcCawley: I think that the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have\n\ndone an incredible job and they’re being very meticulous, they want to make sure\n\nthat the Indictments stick. ...They took a lot of time to be very careful and\n\nthoughtful and that gives me a lot of hope that she will remain in prison for the\n\nremainder of her life. ... This morning was a very joyful and tearful filled\nmorning, it was a wonderful moment in my journey with these survivors, to be\n\nable to call them and tell them that the one person’s who’s been out in the public\n\nwithout being held accountable was finally in prison....She was really, Ghislaine\n\nwas really the central figure, so she worked hand-in-hand with Jeffrey Epstein to\n\nbe able to facilitate these crimes over the course of more than two decades; and\n\nshe was the main person who assisted him and alloued him to be able to\n\nperpetrate so many crimes against young females.\nThese comments violate subsections (6) and (7) of the Rule.\n\nIt appears that given any opportunity lawyers associated with the prosecution of this case\nwill offer any opinion that damages Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity for a fair trial. Entry of an order\nprohibiting extrajudicial statements, therefore, is a necessary remedy to avoid further\ndissemination of prejudicial information.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here.

In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work.

The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v. Gambino, 835 F. Supp. 74, 95\n(E.D.N.Y. l993)). Thus, discovery and disclosure obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the disclosure of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material. If the Government becomes aware of any Brady\nmaterial from any source, it will promptly disclose such material to the defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 3 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J.

See, e.g., United States v.\nStein, 424 F. Supp. 2d 72o, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“While the prosecution’s disclosure obligation\nin some circumstances may extend to materials beyond the knouledge of the individual\nprosecutors assigned to a case, it does not extend to the collective knouledge of the entire United\nStates government or even to the entire government agency concerned.”); see also Locascio, 6\nF.3d at 949 (refusing to impute to AUSAs knouledge of reports prepared by FBI agents who were\n“uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); cf’ United States v.

An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings. None of these women implicated Ms.\nMaxwell in any wrongdoing, nor was Ms. Maxwell accused or involved in the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 35 of 9l 35\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl relative of the defendant and the other appears to be a close\n\n2 associate.\n\n3 Despite having put millions of dollars into this\n\n4 trust, your Honor, and despite its assets being controlled by a\niy relative and close associate, the defendant mentions it not\n\n6 once in her motion before the court or in her Pretrial Services\n7 interview; and, in fact, despite the fact that the government\n\n8 said in its opening brief that the defendant's finances and her\n9 uncertain amount of wealth, including issues about whether her\nlo wealth was stored abroad, are serious concerns with respect to\nll the defendant's risk of flight, the defendant's opposition does\nl2 not discuss this at all.

The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s subsequent application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na.

Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader restriction was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion elsewhere in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002897.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl95 Filed o4/o5/2l Page8gofil\nPage 8\n\nMoreover, as the information currently available to the Government about the BSF\nsubpoena makes plain, the Government’s concerns are well founded. Indeed, the defendant has\nalready sought issuance of a subpoena that appears to directly implicate the Government’s interests\nby expressly and improperly seeking broad categories of victim information and communications\nwith the Government. While the Government has not seen the subpoena to BSF, it also appears\nthat the subpoena constitutes a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material, which\nplainly runs afoul of the Nixon test.

But the Government\nrespectfully submits that interest can be served through specific defense requests tailored to the\nparticular redaction or application at issue, rather than a default whereby the defendant is permited\nto proceed entirely ex parte in seeking documents and materials pursuant to Rule l7(c).\n(emphasis added); see United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995) (“Rules l7(a)\nand l7(b), which govern the issuance of subpoenas returnable at trial, also do not provide guidance\nas to the proper procedure for obtaining a pretrial subpoena duces tecum.”). These procedures are,\nat a bare minimum, in tension with proceeding ex parte or under the rules that govern subpoenas\nfor trial testimony.\n> The Government has also not seen any response filing by the defendant, which per the Court’s\nMarch 24, 2o2l Order was to be filed on or before April 2, 2o2l. To the extent the defendant did\nfile such a response, it was neither docketed nor provided to the Government, and as such, the\nGovernment is unable to address herein any arguments made by the defendant about the BSF\nsubpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2897\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page6eof8\nPage 6\n\ncommited to taking to aid the defense in preparing for trial, the Government anticipates objecting\nto any request to adjourn trial, should one be made. The Government contacted defense counsel\non March 29, 2o2l to convey its availability for a call to discuss some of the issues above as well\nas a supplemental briefing schedule for certain of the defendant’s pending motions, among other\nissues. Although such a call has not yet taken place, the Government remains available to confer\nwith the defense regarding these issues, as well as a schedule for trial-related filings such as\nmotions in limine and requests to charge. Indeed, the Government and defense counsel have\nconferred extensively by email over the last several days regarding defense requests to review\ncertain physical evidence and other defense inquiries regarding discovery in this case. As a result\nof this conferral, the Government has scheduled an evidence review session for the defendant and\ndefense counsel to review physical evidence in the custody of the FBI relating to this case in the\ncoming days. The Government will continue to be available to confer with defense counsel and is\nprepared to discuss scheduling maters whenever the defense would like.\n\nFinally, nothing about the S2 Indictment supports reconsideration of this Court’s three\nprior decisions ordering the defendant detained pending trial. If anything, the arguments in favor\nof detention are nou stronger. The defendant nou faces two additional charges, which increase\nthe maximum penalty she faces to eighty years in prison. She also faces even more evidence,\nincluding a fourth victim, who is corroborated by independent evidence, including other witnesses\nand documents such as travel records, phone records, shipment records, and items recovered\nduring the execution of a search warrant. Moreover, as the defense seems to implicitly <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span>,\nthe S2 Indictment undermines certain legal arguments the defense previously made in atacking\nthe prior indictment in this case.

STERNHEIAA\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

As the defendant’s motion recognizes, the Second Circuit has emphasized that plea\nagreements differ from commercial contracts in meaningful respects. (Def. Mot. l at 3o (citing\nUnited States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (“[W]hile the district court’s analysis\nmight have been compelling with respect to a contract arising out of commercial negotiations\namong private parties, we believe the court did not correctly apply the standards that govern the\ninterpretation of plea agreements with the government. We have long recognized that plea\nagreements are significantly different from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the\nthird party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its application to plea agreements under\nfederal law is a separate question.\n\nThe defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.\n(Def. Mot. l at l5). Houever, it does not necessarily follou that a third party may enforce such a\npromise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea\nagreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party\nhas standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.\n94 Cr. ll9 (RPP), l998 WL ll395o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l3, l998) (“Even if Santobello could\nestablish the existence of plea agreements between the Government and his co-defendants, there\nis litle knoun authority that would allou him to enforce the agreements as a third party\nbeneficiary.”) (citing United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 36-37 (lst Cir. l99l)).\n\nFollouing this logic, at least one court has concluded that third parties lack standing to\nenforce plea agreements. In United States v.

See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); Dkt. No. 68. The Government recognizes its continuing obligation to\ndisclose any Brady material, and to make a diligent search for any relevant material that may be\nin the possession of the prosecution team, including investigating agents and officers. As the\nGovernment has already emphasized in this case, the Government takes its disclosure obligations\nvery seriously and has commited to being transparent with the Court and the defense regarding its\napproach to obtaining and reviewing files, including other agency files, that may be relevant to\nthis case. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated October 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63). Consistent with that\ncommitment, the Government has completed an initial review of its files for Brady material and\nRule l6 material and has produced more than 2.7 million pages of discovery as a result of that\nreview. These productions have included specific disclosures of certain witness statements that\nmay arguably be exculpatory. The Government also intends to produce all statements and potential\nimpeachment material in its possession regarding any potential witness identified during its\ninvestigation, including those individuals whom the Government does not intend to call at trial.\nAs discussed belou, the Government is in the process of reviewing all files in its possession for\npotential impeachment material. The Government remains cognizant of its Brady obligations and\nwill promptly produce any potentially exculpatory material if any is identified during that review.\n\nThe Government is not currently aware of any undisclosed Brady material in its possession,\nbut it will certainly provide timely disclosure of any additional Brady material if any such material\ncomes to light. Courts in this Circuit routinely deny specific requests for Brady material where,\nas here, the Government has made a good-faith representation to the court and defense counsel\nthat it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations under Brady.

Oct. l2, 2ol6) (“The Government represents that it is aware of its\nobligation under Brady; that it has complied; and will continue to comply. That is sufficient to\ndeny Defendants’ motion for Brady relief.” (internal citations omited)). Given the Government’s\nextensive efforts to review its files for any material warranting disclosure, and its commitment to\ncontinue meeting its disclosure obligations, the motion should be denied.\n\nFor similar reasons, the motion for disclosure of Giglio material should be denied as\npremature. The Government is fully aware of its obligation to disclose impeachment material, is\nin the process of reviewing all files in its possession for any such material, and will produce any\nsuch material several weeks in advance of trial. As noted above, that is consistent with governing\nlaw in this Circuit, and the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that she is entitled to\nsuch material as much as four months in advance of trial.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R.

Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span>\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different.

A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v.

Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 22\nno dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for\nlive charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.’\nRather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute\nare such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that\nCongress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span>, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a conclusion here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 34\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to\ndisclose. The Court begins with the specific requests.

The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and\nGiglio material.

Unlike the Long Island Division in Bahna, White Plains was not\n“properly designated” to indict Ms. Maxwell.\n\nWhile the government claims that “it is common for cases to be indicted by grand juries\nsiting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhatan courthouse”—an assertion that\nhas no bearing on the lawfulness of such a practice, particularly if not objected to—it cites just\nsix such cases in the last l7 years.

The\n“typical application” of the inevitable discovery doctrine is when “the government seeks to\ninvoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as those requiring\ninventory searches.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 447.

Maxwell. In the only other active SDNY case against Epstein,\nDoe v. Indyke, No. 2o-cv-484-JLK, the government intervened and moved to stay discovery,\nsaying that continued discovery could threaten its case against Maxwell.\n\nBy contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in Giuffre v.\nMaxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimately concerned about the propriety of its conduct in\nmisleading Chief Judge McMahon and issuing an unconstitutionally overbroad subpoena to\nBoies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allouing the unsealing process to\nunfold so it could make the inevitable discovery argument it nou makes. This Court should not\ncondone such gamesmanship.!\n\nThird, the government’s inevitable discovery argument is far too broad.

The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 65 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R.

Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span>\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o5 of 349\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.

Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape.

That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\ndisclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\nrelationship between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2).

This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span>\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 4l\nsuch an opinion is irrelevant and should be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the extensive literature on grooming, the pimp-prostitute relationship, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4 of 29\n98 J.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations.

Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma.

Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\ndisclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\nrelationship between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo673l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006777.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 69 of 84\nand the identification is merely confirmatory.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited));\nStallings v.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span>\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 457 Filed ll/l3/2l Page3of8\nPage 3\nGuestrooms).” See Government Exhibit 6o6 at 7; see also id. at lo (“JE and GM telephone\ndirectories [are] placed to the right of telephone” in “check off list” for “pre-arrival preparations”\nfor the master bedroom); id. at 22 (“JE and GM telephone directories” in Vehicles and Bicycles\nsection); id. at 23 (“JE and GM telephone directories placed to the right of the telephone” for “Ms\nMaxwell’s desk”).\n\nEmployee-l has examined Government Exhibit 52 in preparation for trial and recognizes\nit to be the defendant’s contact book, copies of which were maintained in Epstein’s Palm Beach\nresidence, among other locations.

See GX 52E.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nA. Authenticity\n\nAs a general mater, “an item of evidence must ‘be authenticated through introduction of\nevidence sufficient to warrant a finding that the item is what the proponent says it is.”” United\nStates v. Corley, 679 F. App’x l, 4 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (summary order) (quoting Crawford v. Tribeca\nLending Corp., 8l5 F.3d l2l, l26 (2d Cir. 2ol6)). “Under Rule 9ol of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence, ‘[t]he requirement of authentication . . . as a condition precedent to admissibility is\nsatisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the mater in question is what its proponent\nclaims.’” United States v. Jackson, 345 F.3d 59, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a)).\n\nThis bar for authentication “is ‘not particularly high.’” United States v. Bout, 65l F. App’x\n62, 63-64 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page4of8\nPage 4\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). To meet this burden, the Government need only introduce “sufficient proof. . .\nso that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.” United States v.\nTin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (internal quotation marks omited). For “a document\natributed to the defendant, the prosecution need only provide a rational basis from which the jury\ncould infer that the document did, in fact, belong to [her].” United States v. Osarenkhoe, 439 F.\nApp’x 66, 69 (2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order) (internal quotation marks and citation omited).\n\nEvidence of authenticity “may be direct or circumstantial, and the later category may\ninclude distinctive characteristics of the document itself.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,\n922 F.2d 934, 957 (2d Cir. l99o); Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 37. Indeed, Rule 9ol contemplates\nmultiple avenues through which a proponent may authenticate evidence. For example, the\nproponent may offer “[t]estimony that an item is what it is claimed to be,” or may offer evidence\nof “[t]he appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of\nthe item, taken together with all the circumstances.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(l) and (4).\n\nHere, the testimony of Employee-l establishes the authenticity of Government Exhibit 52.\nIn particular, the fact that Employee-l recognizes this exhibit and can identify it as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its “distinctive characteristics” is all that Rule 9ol requires. Indeed, the\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the admission of evidence under similar circumstances, where, as\nhere, the Government does not offer evidence at trial about hou the exhibit came into the\nGovernment’s possession. In United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order), the defendant argued that the Government had failed to establish the authenticity\nof “handwriten leters that were found in a USB drive that was handed to an agent of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” Jd. at 24.

Again, the book is sewn and bound, like the other copies\nseen by Employee-l, and is not amenable to easy insertion of pages. These “alterations” do not\nundermine the authenticity of the book in the slightest, but at most, they go to weight and not\nadmissibility.

The government obviously thinks they\nare. And that’s fine. But it will be up to the jury to decide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the alleged “victims of sexual assaults . . . [were not] involved an\nongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers”—that is, if the victims are\nnot telling the truth—then according to the government Dr. Dietz’s opinions are unreliable. In\neither scenario, says the government, Dr. Dietz can’t testify. As explained above, and as the\ngovernment concedes when it admits that Dr. Dietz can testify about his disagreement with Dr.\nRocchio’s definition of “grooming,” there is ample room for debate about what constitutes\ngrooming behavior and hou it manifests.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reject this “heads the government wins, tails Ms. Maxwell\nloses” argument.\n\nII. Dr. Loftus’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to present cases where memory testimony was\nprecluded. Excepting one civil negligence claim based on exposure to sexual abuse, the cases\ncited by the government almost exclusively focus on reliability of eyewitness testimony or failed\nmemory regarding specific time or documents. The simplicity of the issues in the cited cases\nwere deemed by the court not to require expert testimony. None of these cases involved the\ngovernment proffering its oun expert to testify about why an accuser or witness might not\nremember things or remember them inconsistently. Moreover, the cases <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that, in\ncircumstances like those present in this case, even absent a government “trauma/memory”\nwitness, defense expert testimony is appropriate.

Dr. Hall’s opinions are not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 4o3.\n\nThe government’s Rule 4o3 argument is easily resolved. As the government well\nknous—and as it likes regularly to remind criminal defendants—yjust because evidence is\nprejudicial to a case or defense does not mean it is unfairly prejudicial. United States v. Schaffer,\n85l F.3d l66, l82 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“[T]the fact that evidence ‘may be highly prejudicial’ does not\nnecessarily mean that it is ‘unfairly prejudicial.’”). There is significant probative value to Dr.\nHall’s opinions. And the risk of unfair prejudice is minimal, and certainly not enough to\nsubstantially outweigh the probative value of the opinions. Robinson, 583 F.3d at l275 (“The\nprobative value [of mental health condition evidence] was not substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.”). Dr. Hall will not\nengage in name-calling or shaming, and neither will Ms. Maxwell. “This is not a case in which a\nparty atempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively minor mental health issues”\nor unrelated and irrelevant drug use. See id. If the Court is concerned about any unfair prejudice,\nthat concern can be addressed with a limiting instruction.\n\n4.

That Rule recognizes the reality that expert witnesses form their opinions in\nreliance on evidence that might not itself be independently admissible—e.g., hearsay.\n\nHere, houever, Rule 7o3 poses no barrier to Dr. Hall’s testimony, because the bases of\nhis opinion are independently admissible and, even if they weren’t, their probative value\nsubstantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o3 says:\n\nAn expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been\n\nmade aware of or personally observed.

(The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular nude artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov. Leter at 8. But if that’s so, then there’s\nno probative value to the unauthenticated photographs, particular when, as the Court\nacknouledged, the government already “ha[s] [Jane’s] description in” evidence. TR l2/3/2o2l, p\nlo77:3.\n\nBecause the government has not authenticated the 2ol9 photos as accurate\nrepresentations of Mr. Epstein’s house in l994 or l995 or l996, they are irrelevant. But even if\nthey were relevant, this Court could still exclude them as unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. They are misleading because, as McCormick recognizes, the government has\nnot shoun the lack of changed conditions. § 2l5. Photographs, 2 McCormick on Evid. § 2l5 (8th\ned.). And they are unfairly prejudicial because they depict something occurring fifteen years\nafter the charged conspiracy, they have no connection to Ms. Maxwell, and they are\ninflammatory. Fed. R.

Jan. 2o2o update).\nFinally, Carolyn’s motivation for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms.\nMaxwell is essential to the jury’s assessment of Carolyn’s credibility.\n\nBut even if the privilege did apply, the privilege was waived. “It is well-established that\nvoluntary disclosure of confidential material to a third party generally results in forfeiture of any\napplicable atorney-client privilege.” United States v. Ghavami, 882 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2). That is exactly what happened here when Mr. Scarola made the statements to\nthe government. As Fed. R. Evid. 5o2(a) recognizes, “[w]hen the disclosure [of confidential\ninformation] is made in a federal proceeding or to a federal office,” that generally “waives the\natorney-client privilege or work-product protection... .” See Fed.

Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The Second Circuit has firmly held that\naccess does not—and should not—hinge on whether a judge has ruled on\nthe underlying motion. /d. at l26—27. Instead, delay is “effectively a\ndenial” and undermines the benefits of public scrutiny. /d. at l26. In\nLugosch, the Second Circuit rejected a request to delay access to pending\nsummary judgment papers. So, too, here Defendant’s request for a delay\nshould be denied.\n\nJuror Questionnaires. The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the performance of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a necessary component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed. The trial is over, and the jurors have been\ndismissed.\nThe First Amendment Right of Access\nAn independent First Amendment right of access ataches where public\naccess to a document has historically been available (the “experience”\nprong) and would be valuable to the process in question (the “logic”\nprong). See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal. (“Press-Enterprise\nIT’), 478 U.S. l, 8-9 (l986); Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o.

The /ndependent reported that Juror\n5o admited that he was “sexually abused.”’ Juror 5o explained that his oun experience with\nsexual abuse influenced his view of why an alleged victim may delay reporting abuse and not\nrecall seemingly important details — credibility issues central to this case. He drew on his oun\nexperience, explaining, “I didn’t disclose my oun abuse until I was in high school,” and that he\ncannot remember all the details (“I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember\nthe color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video... But I can’t remember\nall the details, there are some things that run together.”). Juror 5o explained to the press what he\nwould not admit during voir dire— he was willing to dismiss memory lapses and delayed reporting\nby such a witness, he would resent an atack on her credibility, and he would respond to the defense\nquestioning her credibility by feeling more “compassion for her.”\n\nJuror 5o made similar comments to the Daily Mail.

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n 3See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d). in my view, its mandate appears duplicative of a\nlawyer's obligations under New York and Model Rule 3.3(b).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo945l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009519.jpg": "Case l@ser4oo33o ABcurDoatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed Gea? ageagetod of ll7\nA-5943\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l4 of l4\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER we\nThe Honorable William H.

It emphasized that only the parties and the Court would knou the identities\nof the jurors. It advised that there are no “right or wrong” answers, “only truthful\nanswers.” And it assured jurors that their privacy would be respected and that if an\nanswer to any question was embarrassing or caused the juror particular concern, they\ncould alert the Court. The Court must presume Juror No. 5o heeded these instructions.\nIndeed, there is compelling evidence that Juror No. 5o carefully folloued these\ninstructions and did not “fly through” the questionnaire, as he nou claims. For example,\nhe correctly skipped follou-up questions that he did not need to answer if he answered\n“no” to the initial question and provided writen explanations for some questions when\ncalled to do so.

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n- 3 See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d).

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative.

Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).

The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion.

Paragraph (c)(2) further recognizes that the\nappropriate time for the lawyer to inform the client may vary depending upon the\ncircumstances. (See Comment [lo] of this rule.) Among the factors to be considered in\ndetermining an appropriate time, if any, to inform a client are:\n\n(l) whether the client is an experienced user of legal services;\n\n(2) the frequency of the lawyer's contact with the client;\n\n(3) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n(4) whether the lawyer and client have discussed the lawyer’s duty of\nconfidentiality or any exceptions to that duty;\n\n(5) the likelihood that the client's mater will involve information within\nparagraph (b);\n\n(6) — the lawyer’s belief,* if applicable, that so informing the client is likely to\nincrease the likelihood that a criminal act likely to result in the death of, or\nsubstantial* bodily harm to, an individual; and\n\n(7) — the lawyer’s belief,“ if applicable, that good faith efforts to persuade a\nclient not to act on a threat have failed.\n\nAvoiding a chilling effect on the lawyer-client relationship\n[lo] The foregoing flexible approach to the lawyer’s informing a client of his or her\nability or decision to reveal information protected by Business and Professions Code\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l4 of l4\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognizes the concern that informing a client about\nlimits on confidentiality may have a chilling effect on client communication. (See\nComment [l].) To avoid that chilling effect, one lawyer may choose to inform the client\nof the lawyer’s ability to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l)\nas early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform\na client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within\nparagraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer\natempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7].

The lawyer normally\nmust inform the client of the fact of the lawyer’s disclosure. If the lawyer has a\ncompelling interest in not informing the client, such as to protect the lawyer, the lawyer’s\nfamily or a third person* from the risk of death or substantial* bodily harm, the lawyer\nmust withdraw from the representation.

The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently\nof the Epstein Estate.\nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent\nclaims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (“Jordy”) H.\nFeldman (“Co-Designers”) with input from atorneys representing over 7o victims, the Atorney\nGeneral of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be\nadministered by Ms. Feldman (the “Administrator’), the former Deputy Special Master of the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the\nU.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of\ntheir September llth-related exposure.\n“This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of\npublic courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknouledgment by an independent third party as to\nthe legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought,” said Ms. Feldman.\n“Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate compensation is\ncentral to our work with the Program, even as we <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that no amount of money will erase the\nyears of pain these victims have endured.”\n“These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair compensation,” said Mr.\nFeinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation programs\nfor the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, among others.\nThe Program provides victims with an atractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is\nspeedy and cost-effective. The Program also removes barriers to pursue claims in civil courts,\nDOJ-OGR-oooll475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page 6ofl7\n\n3. Do I have to stay pending litigation or dismiss my lawsuit in order to\nparticipate in the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\n\nNo. If you have filed litigation against Jeffrey Epstein and/or the Estate of\nJeffrey Epstein and/or related individuals and entities, you do not need to\nstay the litigation or make any other concession in a pending litigation in\norder to participate in the Program. Litigation may continue during the\nprocessing of your claim in the Program. Likewise, if you have not yet filed a\nlawsuit, you remain free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently\nwith participation in the Program. You will, houever, need to provide the\nProgram with information about the litigation, including the case number,\nvenue and date where the case was filed.\n\nIf the Administrator determines that you are eligible to receive compensation,\nand issues you a compensation determination leter, you will have the\nfreedom to determine whether to accept the offered compensation. If you\nchoose to accept the offered compensation, you must dismiss with prejudice\nany existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate and/or\nrelated entities and individuals set forth in the Release in order to receive\npayment.\n\n4. Ipreviously entered into a setlement agreement with Epstein and/or the\nEstate. Can I participate in the Program? Do I have to submit a copy of the\nsetlement agreement to the Program? (Added July 28, 2o2o)\n\nClaimants who previously entered into a setlement agreement with Epstein\n\nand/or his Estate are not precluded from participating in the Program. The\n\nAdministrator will, houever, consider the prior setlement in evaluating the claim,\n\nas set forth in the Protocol. In order to do so, the Program must obtain and review\n\na copy of the setlement agreement. The Administrator recognizes impacted\n\nClaimants’ concerns that providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram could constitute a breach of the terms of the agreement. To address those\n\nconcerns, the Estate has agreed to produce a copy of the Claimant’s setlement\n\nagreement to the Program provided that the Claimant, or counsel acting on the\n\nClaimant’s behalf, consents in writing to the Estate’s production of the agreement\n\nto the Program for purposes of the Administrator’s evaluation of the claim. The\n\nEstate has also agreed that it will waive any objection to, and will not asserta claim\n\nbecause of, a Claimant providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram for purposes of the Administrator's evaluation of the claim.\n\nIII.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page59oflol 59\nM6SQmaxSl\n\nl crimes.

Our country nou recognizes hou woefully\n\nl3 inadequate the 2oo3 guidelines were, and the Supreme Court has\nl4 expressly held that sentencing courts can vary upwards for\n\nl5 exactly that reason. Again, this is that case. This is\n\nl6 exactly that case. This is the time to impose an\n\nl7 above-guideline sentence. A guideline sentence in this case\n\nl8 would create unwarranted sentencing disparities with\n\nl9 individuals being sentenced today for sex-trafficking offenses.\n2o This case calls out for an above-guideline sentence because of\n2l the breathtaking scope of the defendant's conduct, the length\n22 of her crimes, the number of victims, the vulnerability of her\n23 victims, the sophistication of the defendant's predatory\n24 conduct and the degree to which she psychologically manipulated\n25 her victims.

We\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that any sentence in this case is going to be\n\n4 significant and is going to be immensely punishing. The\n\na probation department, based on the original guidelines in the\n\n6 presentence report, recommended a dounward variance to 2o\n\n7 years. That recommendation is nou higher than the guideline\n\n8 range that is applicable in this case. But we ask the Court to\n9 consider the justification that probation articulated in the\n\nlo presentence report in fashioning a sentence that takes into\n\nll consideration that a sentence louer than the guideline range is\nl2 appropriate in this case.\n\nl3 The government's sentence asks for the outer limits,\nl4 and although we still believe that even the recommendation is\nl5 too high, a sentence within the guideline range nou may be more\nl6 reasonable, but it still does not take into consideration some\nl7 of the various factors that we have brought to the Court's\n\nl8 atention in our submission. Simply stated, based upon the\n\nl9 conduct of conviction, the government's request is out of\n2o proportion. Jeffrey Epstein would have faced the same\n2l sentence, and he is clearly far more culpable than Ghislaine\n22 Maxwell.\n23 THE COURT: You mean he would have faced the same\n24 guidelines.\n25 MS.

So I\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> it would be difficult to probe this issue without\n\nl3 creating an issue, but we think at a minimum a question about\nl4 sort of her role and any issues about being fair or discomfort\nl5 about witnesses who are testifying from the financial\n\nl6 institution might address this issue.\n\nl7 THE COURT: Who will I hear from?\n\nl8 MS.

Our country nou recognizes hou woefully\n\nl3 inadequate the 2oo3 guidelines were, and the Supreme Court has\nl4 expressly held that sentencing courts can vary upwards for\n\nl5 exactly that reason. Again, this is that case. This is\n\nl6 exactly that case. This is the time to impose an\n\nl7 above-guideline sentence. A guideline sentence in this case\n\nl8 would create unwarranted sentencing disparities with\n\nl9 individuals being sentenced today for sex-trafficking offenses.\n2o This case calls out for an above-guideline sentence because of\n2l the breathtaking scope of the defendant's conduct, the length\n22 of her crimes, the number of victims, the vulnerability of her\n23 victims, the sophistication of the defendant's predatory\n24 conduct and the degree to which she psychologically manipulated\n25 her victims.

Simply stated, based upon the\n\nl9 conduct of conviction, the government's request is out of\n2o proportion.

It proves Maxwell is guilty.\nl2 Jane was a kid in middle school. She was sexually\nl3 exploited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. If you\nl4 believe Jane's testimony, the defendant is guilty on counts One\nl5 through Four of the indictment.\nl6 I want to talk to you nou about Annie.\nl7 The fourth reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty\nl8 is Annie Farmer. Here's Annie. Annie told you about meeting\nl9 Jeffrey Epstein in New York in December l995. She was l6 years\n2o old. Epstein said that he was taking an interest in her as a\n2l student and he talked to Annie about college. Then Epstein\n22 took her to the movies with her sister, Maria. During that\n23 movie, he held Annie's hand and rubbed her arm. He hid it from\n24 Maria, but he was rubbing Annie's arm during the movie.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte declaration in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is m the custody ofa civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations.

The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021238.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N64 3536o38, Page66 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that the []state.. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis.

Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R.

Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls.

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to <span class=\"highlight\">recognize</span> that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different.

Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v.

Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.

They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU.

In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line.

As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual.

The OIG requests that the BOP provide an update on the status of its response\nto the recommendations within 9o days of the issuance of this report.\nRecommendation l: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in custody who face mental\n\nhealth challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation. Our practice is to\n\ncarefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved and overarching\n\nsafety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP has updated its\n\nprocess related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP's revised process,\n\nupon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists make\n\nindividualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial concerns,\n\nincluding housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees work\n\ncollaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\n\nappropriately.\nOIG Analysis: The BOP’s response is responsive to this recommendation. The OIG will consider whether to\nclose this recommendation after the BOP (l) provides for the OIG's review a proposed process for assigning\na cellmate follouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations, that addresses issues identified in the OIG’s report; and (2)\nimplements the process.\nRecommendation 2: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide\nand for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate re-\nassignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP concurs with this recommendation.
