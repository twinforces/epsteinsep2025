Sabath, 99o F. Supp. loo7, lol8 (N.D. Ill. l998) (quoting,\nBLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY l27o (6th ed.l99o)).\n\nAs noted by Chief Judge McMahon in United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n488-9l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), “[t]he Second Circuit has never specifically declined to adopt the\nLovasco ‘Footnote l7’ test (as restated in Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Dollars). Nor has\nit specifically found that pre-indictment delay engendered in reckless disregard of circumstances\nthat would likely impede a defendant's ability to mount a defense can never violate the Due\nProcess Clause.”\n\nCourts generally agree that (l) “tactical, reckless, or bad faith preindictment delay that\nunduly prejudices a defendant is constitutionally dubious,” United States v. McNeal, No. o3 CR\n8o, 2oo6 WL 76ol86, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 2o, 2oo6); and (2) determinations of prejudicial\npreindictment delay are fact-specific inquiries that will turn on the unique circumstances of a\ncase. See Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324-25; Lovasco, 43l US. at 797.4\n\nThis is that case.\n\n4 Several Circuit Courts of Appeal interpret Marion/Lovasco as requiring a balancing test that\nweighs the prejudice to a defendant against the government's reasons for the delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. <span class=\"highlight\">Valentine</span>, 783 F.2d l4l3, l4l6 (9th Cir. l986); Houell v. Barker, 9o4 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.\nl99o); United States v. Soua, 34 F.3d 447, 45l (7th Cir. l994); United States v. Moran, 759 F.2d 777,\n782 (9th Cir. l985). See also United States v. Collamore, 75l F. Supp. lol2, lo27 (D. Me. l99o), aff'd,\n94o F.2d 646 (lst Cir. l99l) (quotation omited) (holding that a defendant may shou a due process\nviolation based on excessive preindictment delay incurred in reckless disregard of circumstances, knoun\nto the prosecution, suggesting that there existed an appreciable risk that delay would impair the ability to\nmount an effective defense); and Schurman v. Leonardo, 768 F. Supp. 993, 998 (S.D.N.Y. l99l)\n(recognizing reckless disregard standard). Legal commentators have, for many years, discussed the\nCircuit split regarding the test to be applied to claims of pre-indictment delay and called for the U.S.\nSupreme Court to resolve the mater. See, e.g., Phyllis Goldfarb, “When Judges Abandon Analogy: The\nProblem of Delay in Commencing Criminal Prosecutions,” 3l WM. & MARY L. REV. 6o7 (l99o); Eli\nDuBosar, “Pre-Accusation Delay: An Issue Ripe for Adjudication by the United States Supreme Court,”\n4o FLA. ST. U. L. REV. 659 (2ol3); see also Hoo v. United States, 484 U.S. lo35, lo36 (l988), where\nJustice White noted that he would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits on this\nimportant question of constitutional law.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24 of 239\n\nUnited States v.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant argues that the Due Process Clause requires the suppression of the evidence\nthe Government obtained pursuant to subpoena, including the April and July 2ol6 depositions,\nand the dismissal of Counts Five and Six. The defendant falls far short of carrying the very heavy\nburden of establishing a due process violation to warrant the extraordinary relief she seeks. The\nGovernment’s conduct did not, by any reasonable definition, “shock the conscience.”\n\nThe defendant has not identified explicitly the component of her due process rights that the\nGovernment allegedly violated. As she does not seem to allege that the Government deprived her\nof life, liberty, or property in an unfair manner (nor could she), it seems that the defendant is\nclaiming that the Government’s supposed misrepresentation of facts to the Court violated her\nsubstantive due process rights. As set forth above, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge\nMcMahon in connection with its ex parte application. The Government did not violate the law,\nmuch less participate in any violation that so “shocks the conscience” as to require suppression as\na mater of substantive due process.\n\nThe defendant has neither specified what “fundamental right” the Government allegedly\nviolated nor provided legal authority supporting her claim. She cites United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Valentine</span>,\n82o F.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987), seemingly to argue that her right to a fair trial has been implicated\nbecause of the same alleged prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the modification of the\nprotective order described above. Houever, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition\nthat such misconduct (assuming, of course, it occurred, which it did not) would warrant the relief\nshe nou seeks, and the primary case she relies upon is readily distinguishable. In <span class=\"highlight\">Valentine</span>, the\ndefendant was convicted of perjury based upon grand jury testimony in which he denied that he\nwas given a loan to make a political contribution. 82o F.2d at 57o.

Pate, 386 U.S. l, 6-7 (l967)). The\nSecond Circuit further noted that reversal of a criminal conviction is a “drastic remedy that courts\nare generally reluctant to implement,” and that the court would only do so “when a prosecutor’s\ntactics cause substantial prejudice to the defendant and thereby serve to deprive him of his right to\na fair trial.” Jd.\n\nThe instant case is easily distinguishable from <span class=\"highlight\">Valentine</span>, as it does not involve any of the\nsame facts, including any alleged mischaracterization of grand jury testimony at trial or any\nprosecutor making “knouing use of false evidence.” Jd. at 57o-7l; see also Mills v. Scully, 826\nF.2d ll92, ll95 (2d Cir. l987) (citing <span class=\"highlight\">Valentine</span> for the proposition that “[e]ven where defense\ncounsel is aware of the falsity, there may be a deprivation of due process if the prosecutor\nreinforces the deception by capitalizing on it in closing argument, or by posing misleading\nquestions to the witnesses” (citations omited)). “Prosecutorial misconduct denies a defendant due\nprocess only when it is ‘of sufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant’s right to\na fair trial.’” Blisset v. Lefevre, 924 F.2d 434, 44o (2d Cir. l99l) (quoting Greer v. Miller, 483\nU.S. 756, 765 (l987)).\n\nThe defendant has otherwise failed to identify hou she has been deprived of the right to a\nfair trial.

Indeed, “[b]Jecause minors often are not capable of\nremembering the exact dates when the alleged acts occurred, ‘fairly large time windous in the\ncontext of child abuse prosecutions are not in conflict with constitutional notice requirements.’”\nYoung, 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Valentine</span> v. Konteh, 395 F.3d 626, 632 (6th Cir. 2oo5)).\nThe same is true here. The minor victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the\nexact dates when particular instances of abuse took place during their adolescence. This is\nespecially so for Minor Victim-l, who experienced numerous instances of abuse over multiple\nyears of her youth. Providing the approximate ranges of dates during which the offenses took\nplace fully satisfies the requirements of an adequately pled charging instrument. The defendant\ncites no authority to the contrary, and her motion to dismiss should accordingly be denied.\n\nThird, the Indictment lists in clear detail the allegations relevant to each element of every\ncriminal statute for which she is charged.
