ID\nhas several etiologies that often are related to biological or pathological\nprocesses affecting the central nervous system. Many of the specific vulner-\nabilities that arise from ID overlap to some extent with other disorders (e.g.,\nautism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and thus,\nin many cases, individuals with other developmental disabilities may also\nhave ID.\n\nRates of sexual assault are higher in intellectually disabled populations\nthan populations without ID (Mitra, Mouradian, & Diamond, 2oll). It is\nhypothesized that the true rate of sexual assault among individuals with\nID is higher than indicated in studies Goyce, 2oo3). There are many rea-\nsons to believe that study findings are an underrepresentation of the actual\namount of sexual assaults that occur against intellectually disabled people.\nDifficulties with communication and comprehension of language faced by\nindividuals with ID may interfere with the ability to report a sexual assault\n(Ahlgrim-Delzell & Dudley, 2ool). Fear of repercussions for reporting—as\ncaregivers are often the perpetrators—may also discourage reporting Joyce,\n2oo3). Another reason why individuals with ID may not report a sexual\nassault is because of a misunderstanding of the legal process. For instance,\nJoyce (2oo3) briefly mentioned one alleged victim with ID who was reluc-\ntant to continue with an allegation because she was afraid she would get\ninto trouble if the alleged perpetrator was found “not guilty.” Finally, it\ncan be assumed that individuals with ID may choose not to report a sexual\nassault for the same reasons that individuals without ID choose not to report:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6289", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 6 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 5\nhindsight, labeled “grooming” or otherwise imputed as knouledge to onlookers.

Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\n<span class=\"highlight\">occupational</span>, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo3 of 375\n\nPark Dietz, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.\n\nPage 4l\nshooting incidents: The clinical and forensic implications.\nJournal of Forensic Sciences 47(5):l-8, 2oo2.\n\n55.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and <span class=\"highlight\">occupational</span> success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page llofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning.

But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]uch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o975", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021723.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page76 of 93\n63\n\nreviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded\ntwelve jurors of the Defendant’s guilt.” (A.352). Actual\nand inferred bias are both commited to the province\nof the trial judge, and Judge Nathan’s findings that\nneither existed were not clearly erroneous. See Torres,\nl28 F.3d at 44 (“[A] finding of actual bias is based upon\ndeterminations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”); United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[A]\nfinding of inferred bias is, by definition, within the dis-\ncretion of the trial court.”).\n\nMaxwell also argues that Judge Nathan should\nhave implied bias, highlighting some similarities be-\ntween Juror 5o’s sexual abuse and the sexual abuse\ndiscussed at trial. (Br.67). That falls far short of re-\nquiring the District Court to imply bias. First, as\nJudge Nathan explained, the law is not that “bias must\nbe implied when a juror has a personal experience sim-\nilar to the issues at trial.” (A.349). Rather, this Court\nhas “consistently refused to create a set of unreasona-\nbly constricting presumptions that jurors be excused\nfor cause due to certain <span class=\"highlight\">occupational</span> or other special\nrelationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the circumstances of a given case.” (A.349 (quoting\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46)). This case is not within one of\nthe rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory\npresumption of bias applies. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d\nat 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Second, although there\nare some similarities between Juror 5o’s childhood\nsexual abuse, there are also differences: Juror 5o was\nyounger than the trial victims at the time of their\nabuse, he was abused by a family member, and he dis-\nclosed his abuse much earlier. (A.35o). And critically,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l723", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024176.jpg": "BP-AoAAS ie .\n_ JUN lo my = \"US.
