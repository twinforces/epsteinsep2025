Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafajia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3266\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003269.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!\"°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span>\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3269\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed.

In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9l of 349\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim.

This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 94 of 349\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span>\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l78 of 349\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis.

The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\n\nlo Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> in their sentence for good behavior.\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l264\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021267.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E93 3536o38, Page95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.'!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “‘a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span>\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021351.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel79 of 258\nSA-l77\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\n\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\n\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\n\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\n\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this <span class=\"highlight\">reduction</span> was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021821.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lo9-2, o9/l7/2o24, 3634o97, Page‘ of l\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nDEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON CATHERINE O'HAGAN WOLFE\nCHIEF JUDGE CLERK OF COURT\nDate: September l7, 2o24 DC Docket #: l:2o-cr-33o-l\nDocket #: 22-l426cr DC Court: SDNY (NEW YORK\nShort Title: United States of America v.
