(See\nExhibit C.)\n\nThis motion concerns the defense requests for production of documents regarding\nimportant and essential issues in this case. Moreover, the public sphere is replete with\ninformation that the Inspector General of the United States opened an investigation into the\ncircumstances surrounding the death of Iefitey Epstein. (See article atached as Exhibit D.)\n\n| Additionally, it is undisputed that the Inspector General also conducted an extensive\ninvestigation into inner workings of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). The United States Atorney\nGeneral, William Barr and the Acting Bureau of Prisons <span class=\"highlight\">commissioner</span>, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer\nboth made numerous public statements that the Inspector General was undertaking an in-depth\ninvestigation into the Bureau of Prisons’ policies, procedures, staffing and criminal conduct as a\ndirect result of the death of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC on August lo, 2ol9. (See Exhibit D.) This\nreport is important because the defendant believes that this report will contain information that is\nmaterial and relevant to his defense. Moreover, it is the defendant’s assertion that staffing issues,\nstarfing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP procedures go\nto the heart ofhis defense to the government’s criminal allegations.\n\nThe government’s response to Mr. Thomas’ discovery request was not detailed and\nsunply made a blanket denial without giving Mr. Thomas the respect to state any legal\njustification for the denial. Defendant, Thomas, therefore, brings this Motion to Compel, as to\nthe items originally requested by his counsel. |\n\nCc. The Inspector General’s Report and Any Other Reports, Documents,\n\nand/or Memoranda Made by Other Federal Agencies Investigating the\nIncident Surrounding the Death of Jeffrey Epstein Are Discoverable and\nMust Be Produced\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022032.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 9 of 38\nl. The report of the Inspector General, as to both defendants, including, any\nand all supporting memorandums, writen statements, photos, videos, and\nincident reports\n\nThe defendant is entitled to complete disclosure of the Inspector General’s report.\nMoreover, Mr. Thomas has a right to any and all information obtained in this investigation. Not\nonly is it possible that this report contains additional witness statements but this report also has\n. information that has not been furnished by the government in any capacity previously. Moreover,\n_ While the government would like to limit its discovery obligation to reports, videos and\ndocuments related specifically to night and early morning hours of August lo, 2ol9, the defense\nsubmits that there is a much larger context that lead to those events and the charges against\nMichael Thomas. Indeed, the Atorney General of the United States and the “acting”\n<span class=\"highlight\">commissioner</span> of the BOP opened an investigation that was precipitated by the events of August\nlo, 2ol9 but said investigation was much more expansive and in-depth. In November 2ol9, the\n, “acting” <span class=\"highlight\">commissioner</span> Kathleen Hawks Sawyer stated at a congressional hearing under oath that\nthere were more than 33oo vacancies within the BOP and she was surprised that the BOP was\nable to function with nth issues. She went on to state that: “The vast majority of staff are good,\nhardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched.” (See article atached as\nExhibit E.) The broad depth of the Inspector General’s report presumably was that there were a\nmyriad of systematic issues affecting the BOP that alloued the events of August lo, 2ol9 and\nthe death of Jeffrey Epstein to occur. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to disclosure of any\nand all of this information, especiaily if it relates to his defense of the charges that have been\ninitiated, It is the defendant’s contention that this report may also contain Brady-Giglio material.\nIndeed, the prosecutors in this case may be denying the defendant his right to this material\nwithout any knouledge of its contents. If so, this is a dereliction of their duty and denies Mr.\n\nThomas important rights that are the foundation of our judicial system.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024916.jpg": "Page 439\nFiuhee Ron DES\nre elt Aor he GOVERNOR\nAugust 6, 2ol9\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commissioner</span> Rick Swearingen\n\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement\n\n233l Phillips Road\n\nTallahassee, FL 323o8\n\nDear <span class=\"highlight\">Commissioner</span> Swearingen:\n\nToday, I received the atached leter from Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric\nBradshaw.
