The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Chapter V of the French Code of Criminal Procedure (Articles 696 to 696-47-l) sets out\n<span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> provisions pertaining to extradition.\n\n53. The rule against the extradition of nationals is set out under Article 696-4, which states\nthat extradition shall not be granted when the requested person is a French national, and\nthat nationality shall be assessed at the time of the facts in respect of which extradition\nis sought (« Extradition is not granted: l° When the person sought has the French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offence for which extradition is\nrequested. »»”’),\n\n54.

First, ] am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22™ 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). Here, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,\nwhich would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity\nprovision. Child Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. llo4, lo8th Cong. § 2o2 (2oo3) (“The\namendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense commited\nbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section.”). The Senate version contained no\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo266o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 25\nretroactivity provision. PROTECT Act, S. l5l, lo8th Cong. (as engrossed in the Senate, Feb.\n24. 2oo3). When the House and Senate conferenced to resolve differences between the bills, the\nretroactivity provision was omited. As Senator Leahy, one of the bill’s original co-sponsors and\na former chair of the Senate Judiciary Commitee, stated on the Senate floor, the omission was\nintentional: “I am pleased that the conference agreed to drop language from the original House-\npassed bill that would have extended the limitations period retroactively.” Senator Leahy,\nAmber Legislation, Cong. Rec. l49:5o, $5l47 (2oo3).\n\nSuch a clear expression of congressional intent should end the Landgraf analysis at the\nfirst step. In applying Landgraf, the Supreme Court has made clear that the “expressly\nprescribed” analysis is not limited to the text of the statute, but may look to <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history.\nSee Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history”\nas part of first Landgraf step); see also Latab v. Ashcroft, 384 F. 3d 8, l4 (lst Cir. 2oo4) (‘our\ninquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of\nstatutory construction, such as the statute’s structure and <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history”). Indeed, Landgraf\nitself included a <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history analysis. 5ll U.S. at 264. In Landgraf, houever, the Court\nconcluded that the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history at issue did not clearly evidence Congress’ intent regarding\nretroactivity. Jd. That is not the case here.\n\nAs Judge Katzmann of the Second Circuit has recognized, unambiguous <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span>\nhistory should not be disregarded:\n\nWhen courts construe statutes in ways that respect what legislators consider their\n\nwork product, the judiciary not only is more likely to reach the correct result, but\n\nalso promotes comity with the first branch of government. It is a bipartisan\n\ninstitutional perspective within Congress that courts should consider reliable\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history and that failing to do so impugns Congress’s workways.\n\nRobert A.

Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 464\nUSS. 89, lo4 (l983) (noting that Congress had “expressly considered and ultimately rejected”\nproposed interpretation of Civil Service Reform Act); Hudson Valley Black Press v. LR.S., 4o9\nF.3d lo6, ll2 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (noting that <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history, including conference report,\n“plainly establishes that Congress expressly considered broader remedies” against IRS for\nretaliatory audits “before rejecting them’); United States v.

Evid. 4lo as “demonstrating Congress’ explicit\nintention to preclude use” of such statements). It cannot reasonably be disputed that Congress\nintended that the 2oo3 Amendment would not apply retroactively.\n\nNothing in Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2ol7), the only Second\nCircuit case that analyzes the retroactivity of the 2oo3 Amendment, is inconsistent with this\nanalysis. In Weingarten, the court’s analysis was in the context of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim. Thus, Weingarten offers litle more than a distraction from the analysis required\nhere: The court was not required to and did not decide the merits of the issue, noting that “[t]he\nunderlying merits question remains for another day, another case.” Jd. at 58. Moreover, the\ndefendant in Weingarten did not raise, and the court did not consider, the argument that Congress\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2662\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 239\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for ten years after the offense, whichever\nis longer.”).\n\nFinally, later that same year, Congress enacted a new statute as part of the Adam Walsh\nChild Protection and Safety Act of 2oo6, Pub. L. No. lo9-248, l2o Stat. 587. That statute\neliminated the statute of limitations entirely for certain crimes involving the sexual exploitation of\nminors. /d. tit.

The 2oo3 Amendment to Section 3283 Applies Retroactively\n\nCounts One through Four of the Indictment charge crimes that occurred between l994\nand l997. At the time of the offense conduct, the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3283 (l994), ran until “the child reaches the age of 25.” Houever, in 2oo3, while the statute of\nlimitations had not yet run for the crimes charged in the Indictment,!? Congress amended the\nstatute, extending the limitations period to permit a prosecution at any time “during the life of the\nchild.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). Because the victims are all alive, the Indictment is timely under\nthe 2oo3 amendment.\n\nPut simply, the 2oo3 amendment applies to any conduct that could have been charged at\nthe time of its enactment. The <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> purpose behind Section 3283 and a plain reading of the\nstatute compel this conclusion, and courts have repeatedly held that the 2oo3 amendment applies\nretroactively, provided that the statute of limitations had not run for the offense at the time of the\namendment. See, e.g., United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Because Congress evinced a clear intent to extend, rather than shorten, the statute of limitations\napplicable to sexual abuse crimes, and because there is no ex post facto problem here, the\nprosecution was timely.”) (citing United States v.

For the reasons set forth belou, the 2oo3 amendment of\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 satisfies both steps of Landgraf, and should be applied to pre-enactment conduct.\n\nl. The 2oo3 Amendment Satisfies Step One of Landgraf\n\nAt step one of the Landgraf analysis, the question is whether Congress has “expressly\nprescribed the statute’s proper reach.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. When evaluating Congress’s\nintent at step one of the Landgraf inquiry, the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history. Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o6-o8. In this case, the amended\nversions of Section 3283 evince Congress’s express intent to extend the statute of limitations. The\ntext and history of Section 3283 firmly establish that, with each amendment of the statute of\nlimitations, Congress intended to repeal and replace the prior version of the statute and thereby\nextend the time to bring live charges of child sexual abuse.\n\nThe 2oo3 amendment, like the l994 version of the statute, specifically states that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a child sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution of such offense during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3).\nClaims that were live in 2oo3 were, at the time, subject to the then-existing statute of limitations,\nwhich ran until the victims reached the age of 25. Whenever that statute of limitations ran, it would\n“otherwise preclude prosecution.” Instead, that statute of limitations was replaced by the 2oo3\namendment.\n\nThe Eighth and Ninth Circuits have both held that Congress intended to extend the statute\nof limitations for live claims of sexual abuse. In United States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682 (8™ Cir.\n2oo5), the Eighth Circuit reasoned that “both the title and wording of § 35o9(k) indicate that\nCongress intended by it to extend the general statute of limitations. . . . § 35o9(k) was later\nrecodified at § 3283 and continued to extend the statute of limitations in child abuse cases.” Jd. at\n684 (citing United States v. Johns, l5 F.3d 74o, 743 (8th Cir. l994) (holding that an earlier version\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 239\nof § 35o9(k) applied to conduct predating its enactment in l99o)). The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual\nabuse, but the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a child could not be prosecuted\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\nidentified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express intention was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 amendment extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Broun, 8oo F. App’x 455, 46l (9th Cir. 2o2o) (2ol4 indictment charging,\namong other crimes, sex trafficking offenses dating to 2ooo and 2ool), cert. denied, No. 2o-5o64,\n-- 8.

The defendant quotes\nSenator Patrick Leahy’s comments on the 2oo3 conference commitee report to the effect that “the\nconference agreed to drop language from the original House-passed bill that would have extended\nthe limitations period retroactively.” (Def.

No such intent is manifest in either the text or in Senator Leahy’s statement.\n\nThe reach of Section 3283 is clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the statute\nof limitations to pre-enactment conduct, the Court should resolve its analysis at Landgraf step one\nand apply the statute as Congress intended. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—at worst—\nambiguous. Ifthe Court takes that view, it should proceed to Landgraf step two.\n\n2s The 2oo3 Amendment Satisfies Step Two of Landgraf\n\nIf the Court were to determine that the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> intent behind Section 3283 is ambiguous,\nthe inquiry then extends to the second step of the Landgraf analysis, which examines the\nretroactive effects of the statute. As the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf, “[a] statute does\nnot operate ‘retrospectively’ merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating\nthe statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations based in prior law.” 5ll U.S. at 269. Instead, the\nquestion is whether the statute “would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a\nparty’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already\ncompleted.” Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995)\n(quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o). Applying Section 3283 here would have none of those\neffects. Maxwell’s rights, liabilities, and duties were governed by the substantive criminal statutes\ngoverning her conduct. Until the statute of limitations expired, Maxwell had the same legal\nliability, the same rights, and the same incentives to retain evidence. A statute extending that\nperiod ataches no new legal consequences; rather, it preserves the status quo. Therefore, the\nstatute does not operate “retrospectively” within the meaning of Landgraf.

Maypa,\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2993\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 239\nbroad definition, courts have held that Section 3283 “does not require that an offense consist of a\nsexual act between a defendant and a specific child,” Vickers, 2ol4 WL l838255, at *ll, but\ninstead reaches offenses involving the transportation of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity.\nSee Sensi, 2olo WL 235l484, at *2-3 (collecting cases interpreting the term “sexual abuse” to\nencompass “all crimes that would logically relate to the common understanding of sexual abuse\neven when found in chapters llo (‘Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and ll7\n(‘Transportation of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related Crimes’) of title l8”); Schneider, 8ol F.3d\nat l96-97 (holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant convicted of traveling with the purpose\nof engaging in sex with a minor victim, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b)); Vickers, 2ol4 WL\nl838255, at *ll-l2 (holding that violations of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) were crimes involving sexual\nabuse under Section 3283).\n\nThe defendant’s motion does not engage with these authorities at all.

The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties.

In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

While the\ngovernment argues that this language refers to the pre-amendment version of § 3283, the Second\nCircuit recognized in Weingarten that “there is a more natural interpretation of that phrase that\ndoes not address retroactivity—that Congress intended the language in the 2oo3 version of\n§ 3283 to clarify that the statute prescribes a statute of limitations for applicable offenses that is\ndifferent from the default five-year limitations period under federal law.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d\nat 55. See also Miller, 9ll F.3d at 644 (suggesting that “otherwise preclude” language “may\nrefer only to preclusion by the five-year federal default statute of limitations”); Nader, 425 F.\nSupp. 3d at 626 (interpreting same language to “merely ‘signal the drafter’s intention that the\nprovisions .. . override conflicting provisions of any other section,’” rather than the pre-\namendment version of § 3283) (quoting Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 5o8 U.S. lo, l8\n(l993)).\n\nThis interpretation is bolstered further by the presence of the same “[n]o statute of\nlimitation[s] that would otherwise preclude” language in the l99o statute that originally created\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 22\nthe expanded statute of limitations for child sex abuse crimes. See Opp. Mem. 24 (quoting\nCrime Control Act of l99o, Pub. L. No. lol-647, tit. II, § 225(a), lo4 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified\nat l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k) (l99o)). In l99o, “the only existing limitations period to which the\nlanguage could have referred was the [five-year] default limit set forth in [l8 U.S.C. § 3282].”\nMiller, 9ll F.3d at 644. That is the logical reading of the same provision here.\n\nThe government cannot prevail on step one. If step one is not resolved in Ms. Maxwell’s\nfavor, the inquiry must proceed to step two.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s Alleged\n\nOffenses Would Have Impermissible Effects.\n\nEven if the Landgraf inquiry were to proceed to the second step—whether retroactive\napplication would have impermissible effects—Ms. Maxwell should prevail. In arguing\notherwise, the government effectively claims that in the retroactivity context, Landgraf permits\nthe Court to ignore the bedrock principle that “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally\ninterpreted in favor of repose.’” TYoussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting\nUnited States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 5l8, 522 (l932)). But nothing in Landgraf, a civil case,\npurports to limit that principle, let alone abrogate it.\n\nThe government asserts that no court has held that retroactively extending a filing period\nfor live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under Landgraf (Opp. 35),\nbut that is not so. In United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649 (D.N.J. 2ol7), the court held\nthat it would be impermissible to retroactively extend a statute of limitations for live charges\n“absent clear <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> intent” to apply the expanded limitations retroactively. Jd. at 655. In\ndoing so, the court read Landgraf in conjunction not only with Toussie but also with Hughes\nAircraft Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 52o U.S. 939 (l997), a post-Landgraf opinion in which the\nSupreme Court reiterated the law’s presumption against retroactivity and reiterated that “we\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 22\ncommission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense.” /d. at 39\n(emphasis added by Court). Because § 3283 contains no such modification to the words “offense\ninvolving,” Nijhawan is entirely consistent not only with the Supreme Court cases that interpret\n“offense involving” language as referring to elements of the offense, but also with a similar\ninterpretation of the language as it appears in § 3283.'°\n\nThe Eighth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll),\nsquares perfectly with this approach. In Coutentos, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a\ncharge of possession of child pornography, even though the facts of the case involved conduct\nthat went beyond the elements of child pornography and, according to the court, constituted\nsexual abuse. 65l F.3d at 8l7. The government’s atempt to distinguish Coutentos on the\nground that “this case does not involve the possession of child pornography” (Opp. 4l) misses\nthe point: In determining whether § 3283 applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual\nsexual abuse and instead confined its focus to the elements of the offense of possession of child\npomography. In other words, it used the “necessarily entails” approach. Similarly, § 3283\nrequires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard\nallegations of conduct beyond those elements.\n\nFinally, the government atempts to distinguish Bridges, in which the Supreme Court\nused the equivalent of a “necessarily entails” approach specifically with respect to a statute of\nlimitations, and argues that Bridges is an outlier based on its <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history. But the\ngovernment fails to identify a single statute of limitations other than § 3283 in which a fact-\n\n° The government cites the Second Circuit’s statement in a footnote in Weingarten that the “offense involving”\n\nlanguage is “equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” Opp. 39-4o (quoting Weingarten, 865 F.3d at\n6o n.ll). Houever, Weingarten relied exclusively on Nijhawan for that proposition; like the government, it cited no\ncase in which a fact-based approach had been used to apply an “offense involving” statute other than § 3283. In any\nevent, the Second Circuit did not hold that a fact-based approach applies to § 3283; it held only, in the context of an\nineffective assistance claim, that it was “not obvious” which approach applies. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo367o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003685.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 34\nTo the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is\ninappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that... . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3685\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”’” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\n<span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “‘inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3689\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worm\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n‘“‘Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*??\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\nS28 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\n394 Inre Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005182.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 338 Filed lo/l2/2l Page 4 of 22\n| The <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> histofy of $3235 Joes fox P bey ong :\nConstess raising the Kmitation pehred, and Act oer thy |\n“OftyInates Fron the I98G Sexvat Abuse Aede |\nTHiS Caurts Find ting $ ate Podentiy Wome Fot |\nCxamP le. § 3283 deesnt Soy 3 “Gend vet In Vo luke”) .\n Cbtacueis tn opfaren) 3 l45 ‘oflense Inve lulng ota |\nOars See brick) dhe Supteme Govrt found the leader |\nmest Probably PequileS a Statutory elements hagquity. |\n Thete l6 at$e no feasen te vse Dodges C Soma)\nko Aiffetence Brdges Coffense IN VSlUing Fra ve ly\nce Lavgse wn Fact the le Jislative history OF § $n h%\n\n| docs Shaws the nNatlevo Pri pose of $3a 8B.

Applicable law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall “be\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V.\nThat guarantee “serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors,” ensuring that a court\ndoes not “exceed its <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense.” Broun v. Ohio, 432 U.S. l6l, l65 (l977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38,\n48 (2d Cir. 2ool). An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,\n“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law\nand fact, only one crime has been commited.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999)). “A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed,\nhouever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the same in fact and in law.’”” United States v. Jones,\n482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir.\n2oo3)).\n\nIf the two offenses at issue are both conspiracies charged under the same statute, then the\nmultiplicity inquiry turns on whether the two conspiracies are the same “in fact,” meaning they\ninvolve the same agreement. United States v. Araujo, No. l7-CR-438 (VEC), 2ol8 WL\n3222527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol8) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d ll8, l24-25\n(2d Cir. 2oo4)); United States v. Gaskin, 364 F.3d 438, 454 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“[T]o survive a\ndouble jeopardy atack, the government would have to shou that the two schemes involved\n‘distinct’ agreements.”). Yet “whether the evidence shous a single conspiracy or more than one\nconspiracy is often not determinable as a mater of law or subject to bright-line formulations.”\nJones, 482 F.3d at 72. Rather, the parties agree that the Court’s inquiry is guided by the Second\nCircuit’s Korfant factors. See, e.g., United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel5 of 29\n\nA, Ms. Maxwell Does Not Present a Continuing Danger to the Public.\n\nIt is clear from the Guidelines commentary and the Congressional intent underlying the\ncreation of § 4Bl.5 that the adjustment does not apply to Ms. Maxwell. The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator.... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly\nhigh — released rapists are lo times more likely to repeat their crime than other\ncriminals. The Congress has a responsibility to address the issue by passing a\nbill that would put an end to this cycle of violence repeated by a single\nperpetrator.” Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of l998,\nHearing Before the House Judiciary Commitee, Subcommitee on Crime, lo5\"\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 36 of55\nquotation marks omited); see United States v. Parkins, 935 F.3d 65, 67 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (citing\nSash). And even when Guidelines commentary is explanatory and binding, it is “akin to an\nagency’s interpretation of its oun <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> rules,” and therefore does not control where it is\n“inconsistent with the regulation.” Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 45 (l993) (quoting\nBoules v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 4lo, 4l4 (l945)). Ifthe Guidelines commentary\nwere flatly inconsistent with the plain text of the Guideline itself—because the Guideline squarely\napplies where the commentary says it should not—the Guideline itself would control. See Sash,\n396 F.3d at 522 (“We need not resort to background commentary interpretations when the\nlanguage of the Guidelines is plain.”).\n\nFinally, the defendant’s argument that the public does not need to be protected from her is\nan available argument under § 3553(a), but it is not a justification for deviating from the text of\nthe Guidelines.*\n\nIll. Discussion\nA. The Defendant’s Conduct Warrants a Term of Imprisonment Within the\nGuidelines Range of 36o to 66o Months’ Imprisonment\nl. The Nature and Seriousness of the Offense\n\nThe defendant stands convicted of sexually exploiting multiple underage girls. Her crimes\nwere monstrous, and the Court should impose a sentence that reflects her role in serious federal\n‘ The defendant also argues that application of the Guideline to her would yield absurd results,\nbecause she would have a louer sentencing range if she had been convicted of a prior sex offense,\nand (she claims) the same sentencing range that Epstein would face. (Def. Mem. l4-l6). But\nSection 4Bl.5(a) is structured differently than Section 4Bl.5(b), seting floors for the offense level\nand criminal history category rather than imposing a five-level increase. See U.S.S.G. Amend.\n6l5 (explaining that § 4Bl.5(a)’s penalties rely on the prior conviction but § 4Bl.5(b) does not).\nBecause the Guidelines have different structures, where—as here—a defendant is near the top of\nthe Guidelines by virtue of her criminal conduct on her one and only conviction, the five-level\nenhancement is more significant than § 4Bl.5’s penalty floors.

The federal crimes of conviction require the\ninvolvement of minors. The Individuals claiming sexual abuse who were not minors may\nqualify generically as victims of sexual abuse but not as statutory victims of the federal offenses\nof conviction.\nThe Individuals Are Not \"Victims\" of the Counts of Conviction\n\nNeither the Superseding Indictment nor the Court’s jury instructions support a position\nthat anyone who was not a minor is a \"victim\" of the counts of conviction. The involvement of a\nminor is an essential element of the federal offense conduct. Maria Farmer claims she was\nabused during the time period of the indictment; houever, she was not a minor. Sarah Ransome\nwas not a minor when she claims she interacted with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell from\napproximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in this case ended.\nTeresa Helm also was not a minor and it is unknoun when she claims to have had contact with\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. It is unknoun whether Juliete Bryant was a minor or when she claims\nto have had contact with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. None of these Individuals testified at trial\nand their credibility remains unexamined. Regarding the charges in this case, they do not qualify\nas victims under the CVRA.\nThe Individuals Are Not \"Victims\" Within the Meaning of the CVRA\n\nFor the Individuals to invoke the rights enumerated under the CVRA, they must first be\ndetermined to be \"victims\" within the meaning of the statute. The CVRA defines a “crime\nvictim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal\noffense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo594\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010767.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page l4 of 353 |\n.

Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes.

We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that. . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020771.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel53 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.””” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\n<span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020774.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel56 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nis\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020786.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel68 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worn\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o786\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020923.jpg": "Case 22-l4 Q :\n26, Document 58 o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page97 of 22l\nA-297\nCa :2o-cr- - F\nse l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 638 Filed o3/o9/22 Page 9 of 29 ;\n‘\n|\n) Juror ID: 8o |\nl7a.

Because § 3283\nemploys the same “offense-involving” language as the statutes analyzed in those\ncases, compare l8 U.S.C. § 3283 with id. § 3287; 26 U.S.C. § 653l, a similar\ninterpretation should govern.

But that did\nnot deter it from asserting, without citation to primary authority, that, when\nCongress extended the statute of limitations, it “evinced a general intention to cast\na wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as possible.” Al44. This\nquestionable statement ultimately derives from a Third Circuit opinion, U.S. v.\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5), which itself quotes an Eleventh\nCircuit case, United States v.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*#° The district court noted that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”**° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

The court\ndistinguished /n re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

In ini-\ntially enacting a special statute of limitations for child\nsex abuse offenses, Congress sought to “mak[e] it eas-\nier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that\nmay be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 54. But that limitations period proved to be “in-\nadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66,\nat 54. Tellingly, the conference report offered the ex-\nample of a child rapist who “could not be prosecuted”\nbecause he was “identified ... as the perpetrator one\nday after the victim turned 25.” Jd. Given that Con-\ngress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-\ntion because the limitations period had expired, there\nis every reason to believe that it intended to preserve\nthe ability to prosecute pre-enactment offenders whose\nlimitations period had not yet expired. See United\nStates v.

But those words readily apply in de-\nscribing the application of the 2oo3 amendment to pre-\nenactment conduct. Consider an offense commited\nagainst a l6-year-old in the year 2ooo. The statute of\nlimitations then in effect indeed “would ... preclude\nprosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim\nturned twenty-five.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

The government\n\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\n\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*??\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”*°* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the <span class=\"highlight\">legislative</span> history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\n393 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\n394 Inre Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024381.jpg": "Public Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(2o2) i\nRO /25/2ol9 lo:54 AM >>>\nThis is a heads up that our public affairs office, IPPA leadership, and the Director's office drafted a statement\nfor all Epstein inquiries today that DOJ's public affairs folks are nou reviewing.
