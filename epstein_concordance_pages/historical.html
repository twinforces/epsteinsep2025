Sec. Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d 625, 628 (S.D.N-Y. 2ol5). Although\nRule 6(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure generally lists the exceptions to grand\njury secrecy, the Second Circuit has recognized that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in\nwhich release of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d Cir. l997); see also Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 767 (7th\nCir. 2ol6) (“Rule 6(e)(3)(E) does not displace that inherent pouer. It merely identifies a permissive\nlist of situations where that pouer can be used.”). One such “special circumstance” is <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span>\ninterest by the public. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo5. Under Jn re Craig, this Court retains discretion\nto determine “whether such an interest outweighs the countervailing interests in privacy and\nsecrecy|.]” Id.\n\n5. Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested\nand concerned about the Epstein mater. Indeed, other jurists have released grand jury transcripts\nafter concluding that Epstein’s case qualifies as a mater of public concern. See Order Granting\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Court’s February 29, 2o24 Order, CA Florida\nHoldings, LLC v. Dave Aronberg and Joseph Abruzzo, 5o-2ol9 CA-ol468l (l5th Cir. July l,\n2o24). After all, Jeffrey Epstein is “the most infamous pedophile in American history.” Jd. The\nfacts surrounding Epstein’s case “tell a tale of national disgrace.” Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d l244, l247\n(llth Cir. 2o2l) (discussing the plea agreement secured by Epstein in Florida). The grand jury\nrecords are thus “critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history.” Jn re Petition of\nNat. Sec. Archive, lo4 F.

Notably, the privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance are\nsubstantially diminished due to Epstein’s death. Of course, as noted above, the Department of\nJustice will work with the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\nto redact all victim-identifying information prior to any release.\n\n6. For these reasons, this Court should conclude that the Epstein and Maxwell cases\nqualify as a mater of public interest, release the associated grand jury transcripts, and lift any\npreexisting protective orders.

Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public\ndisclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000751.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 6of lo\nSupp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (applying Jn re Craig) (“Many historians ... have spent\ncountless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000768.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of5\nBSF\n\nA. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000925.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel5 of 3l\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThe question of whether a bail package will reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence is a mixed question of law and fact.

The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4of9\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves in limine to preclude reference to the accusers as “victims” or\n“minor victims.” Ms. Maxwell moves for an order precluding all trial participants from referring\nto the accusers as “victims” or “minor victims.” Instead, all trial participants, including the\nCourt, should refer to all persons by their individual names.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nUnder the United States Constitution, Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent unless the\ngovernment proves all elements of the alleged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. U.S. Const.\namend. V; Jn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). The presumption of innocence has deep\n<span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> roots and is a core tenet of criminal law. “The principle that there is a presumption of\ninnocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its\nenforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.” Coffin v. United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of innocence).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., Jackson v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a rape\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005892.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation.

The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span>,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public\ndisclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015067.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page6oflo\nSupp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (applying Jn re Craig) (“Many historians ... have spent\ncountless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page2of9\nhearsay-laden grand jury transcripts, which contain statements presented in secret\nand never challenged by the adversarial process. Maxwell has never been alloued to\nreview those transcripts even though the government did not oppose her recent\nrequest to do so.\n\nThe government seeks to unseal the grand jury transcripts, citing “<span class=\"highlight\">historical</span>\ninterest” without regard for hou that release will affect Maxwell’s privacy interests,\nher pending Petition, and any future litigation. The government’s Memorandum\n(Dkt. 796) cloaks itself in Jn re Craig, but that case emphasized that disclosure\nrequires the most careful judgment and that “the public's curiosity in a defendant’s\nsecret conduct at a grand jury hearing cannot eclipse the right the defendant has to\nsecrecy and overwhelm his objection to public discourse.” l3l F.3d 99, lo5 (2d Cir.\nl997).\n\nBecause this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.\n\nTl. THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO ESTABLISH “SPECIAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES” WARRANTING DISCLOSURE OF GRAND\nJURY MATERIALS IN AN ONGOING CASE\n\nThere is a tradition in the United States that is “older than the Nation itself,”\nthat grand jury proceedings shall remain secret. In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol-o2\n(quoting In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir.l973)). This tradition of secrecy is\ncodified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). The rule of secrecy is not without\nexceptions, houever, and Rule 6(e)(8) lists several exceptions. The Second Circuit\nhas additionally recognized that there are certain “special circumstances” in which\n\nLSRETE MOSS\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 Filed o8/o5/25 Page3of9\nrelease of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of Rule\n6(e)(3). In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo2. Importantly, “the discretion of a trial court in\ndeciding whether to make public the ordinarily secret proceedings of a grand jury\ninvestigation is one of the broadest and most sensitive exercises of careful judgment\nthat a trial judge can make.” /d. at lo4.\n\nIn re Craig involved a petition by a doctoral candidate to unseal the nearly 5o-\nyear-old grand jury testimony of a high-ranking government employee, Harry Dexter\nWhite, based on <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> interest in White’s suspected role as a communist spy. The\ncourt in In re Craig denied the petition to unseal. On appeal, the Second Circuit\naffirmed the trial court’s denial of the petition, finding that the court did not abuse\nits discretion when it found that sufficiently exceptional circumstances did not exist\nto warrant disclosure. Id. at loo-ol, lo7.\n\nIn affirming the louer court’s denial of the motion to unseal, the Second Circuit\nacknouledged <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> interest as a potential basis for disclosure and offered a non-\nexhaustive list of factors that a trial court might consider when confronted with\nruling on a motion to unseal. Jd. at lo5-o6. Those factors include, but are not limited\nto:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure; (i) whether\nthe defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government\nopposes the disclosure; (ll) why disclosure is being sought in\nthe particular case; Gv) what specific information is being\nsought for disclosure; (v) hou long ago the grand jury\nproceedings took place; (vi) the current status of the principals\nof the grand jury proceedings and that of their families; (vi)\nthe extent to which the desired material—either permissibly\nor impermissibly—has been previously made public; (vi)\nwhether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nMARKUS/MOSS\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015092.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page6eof9\ninstitution and others, Judge Hellerstein granted a petition to unseal the grand jury\ntestimony of David Greenglass, Ethel Rosenberg’s brother. In granting the petition\nto unseal Greenglass’ grand jury testimony, the court observed that in the 65 years\nthat had passed since the Rosenberg trial, many believed that Ethel Rosenberg was\ninnocent and had been framed by Greenglass. Jd. at 628. As a result, and only after\nGreenglass had passed away, the court concluded that Grenglass’ grand jury\ntestimony should be released since it provided information in a case of <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span>\ninterest to the public. Id. at 629 (holding that “the requested records are critical pieces\nof an important moment in our nation’s history’ and “the time for the public to guess\nwhat they contained should end.”). It is noteworthy that Judge Hellerstein refused\nto unseal the transcript while Grenglass was alive, finding that Greenglass’ interest\nin preserving the secrecy of his grand jury testimony “was sufficient to prevent its\nunsealing during his life, despite the public interest in the case.” Id. at 628.\n\nIn re Petition of American <span class=\"highlight\">Historical</span> Association involved a similar request by\n<span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> associations in l998 to unseal transcripts of two special grand juries\nconvened from l947 to l95o pertaining to the espionage investigation of Alger Hiss.\nInre Am. Hist. Ass'n, 49 F. Supp. 2d 274 (S.D.N.Y. l999). Hiss, a former high-ranking\nState Department official, was convicted of commiting perjury in responding to\nallegations that he was a Soviet spy. Hiss maintained his innocence until his death\nand publicly suggested that his prosecution was a political hit job by Richard Nixon\nto mobilize public opposition to communism. Id. at 294. In granting the request to\nunseal the fifty-year old grand jury materials, the court noted the significant passage\n\nLSRETG MOSS\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015093.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page 7 of9\nof time along with the fact that most of the relevant witnesses, including Hiss, had\ndied. Jd. at 293. The court ultimately ruled that the great <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> importance of\nthe Hiss case outweighed the minimal interest in preserving secrecy. Id. at 298\n(noting that alleged Soviet espionage against the United States was a controversial\nand historically significant issue in domestic politics during the l94os and l95os, and\nto the present day).\n\nDisclosure is being sought in this case due to immense public interest in Jeffrey\nEpstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s cases, along with public interest in the\ngovernment’s handling of those investigations and prosecutions. The public interest\nidentified by the government—while understandable—is insufficient to warrant\ndisclosure of grand jury materials at this time. The government frames this interest\nas “<span class=\"highlight\">historical</span>,” yet it is nothing more than widespread and intense public curiosity\nabout an ongoing criminal case. Neither Jn re Petition of National Security Archive,\nnor In re Petition of American <span class=\"highlight\">Historical</span> Association, support the conclusion that the\nMaxwell grand jury materials should be released. Each of those cases involved\ntestimony dating back at least five decades, along with grand jury testimony relating\nto defendants and witnesses who were deceased.\n\nIn re Biaggi is equally unavailing. In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. l973).\nThat case involved the unsealing of grand jury testimony of a U.S. Congressman,\nMario Biaggi, who had not been indicted, and who waived any protection to secrecy\nby “seeking complete disclosure in the form of a motion requesting disclosure of his\noun testimony for its oun sake.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 493 (2d Cir. l973).

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page 24 of 27\n|\nThe government has plainly not met its burden to justify an unsealing in this case. And\neven if this Court determines that unsealing is warranted despite the high burden required to do\nSO, a respectfully request that any reference to them or to any information which may\nbe used to identify them be redacted from any public filing. a\na innocent third parties at the time of any allegations\ncontained im the grand jury materials, and any references to them should remain sealed.

See Jn re\nApplication of Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79-8o (2d Cir. l99o) (emphasizing in the context of a\nrequest to unseal a search warrant application that “privacy interests of innocent third parties as\nwell as those of defendants . . . should weigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation” (quoting Jn\n: re N.Y. Times Co., 828 F.2d llo, ll6 (2d Cir. l987))); Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (directing courts\nassessing requests to unseal grand jury materials to pay particular atention to the request’s\ntiming, given that the passage of time may weigh in favor of disclosure of grand jury materials\nbecause it inevitably “brings about the death” of all parties involved).\nL The grand jury materials in this case should remain sealed\nThere is a long history of maintaming the secrecy of grand jury proceedings for a reason.\nThe purposes of the secrecy include ensuring the freedom of grand juries in their deliberations\nand “to protect [the] mnocent accused ....” Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. at 68l n.6. Beyond\nprotecting innocent parties who are the subject of grand jury investigations, this secrecy also\nserves to protect witnesses and other innocent nonparties who may be mentioned in grand jury\nproceedings from any unwarranted association with the crimes alleged therein. Because of the\npolicy and due process rationale behind grand jury secrecy, the permissible bases upon which\ngrand jury materials may be shared are limited to certain exceptions in Rule 6(e)(3). The Second\nCircuit has recognized limited additional “special circumstances” in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate, including <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> interest by the public.

Garland, 43 F 4th\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel3 of 3l\n276, 285-87 (2d Cir. 2o22) (“Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll”). The doctrine is based on the\ndistrict court’s supervisory authority over the grand juries it empanels. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at\nlo2 & n.2. It today is recognized in the Second and Seventh Circuits, but not elsewhere.!”\n\nThe Second Circuit has set out a “non-exhaustive list of [nine] factors that a trial court\nmight want to consider when confronted with these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive\n‘special circumstances’ motions.” /d. at lo6. These are:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure;\n\n(i) whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\n\nthe disclosure;\n\n(i) why disclosure is being sought in the particular case;\n\n(iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n\nMost Circuits to address the issue have held that the only justifications for disclosing grand\njury maters are those set out in Rule 6(e)(3). See, e.g., McKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 843,\n85o (D.C. Cir. 2ol9), cert. denied, l4o S. Ct. 597 (2o2o); In re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d\n48l, 488 (6th Cir. l99l); United States v. McDougal, 559 F.3d 837, 84l (8th Cir. 2oo9); Pitch v.\nUnited States, 953 F.3d l226, l24l (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc), cert. denied, l4l S. Ct. 624\n(2o2o). The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special circumstances. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize disclosure of grand jury materials based on their <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v. United States, 27 F.4th 84, 93-94 (lst Cir. 2o22).\nBefore the D.C. Circuit’s 2ol9 decision finding Rule 6(e) to supply the only bases for disclosure,\ndistrict courts in that Circuit had considered—and sometimes granted—petitions to disclose\ngrand jury materials of <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> importance, citing the Second Circuit’s precedents recognizing\ntheir authority to permit such disclosures. Compare In re Petition of Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42,\n5o (D.D.C. 2oll) (granting request to disclose President Nixon’s grand jury testimony about\nWatergate due to its <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> importance), and In re Application to Unseal Dockets Related to\nthe Independent Counsel’s l998 Investigation of President Clinton, 3o8 F. Supp. 3d 3l4, 33o-36\n(D.D.C. 2ol8) (ordering disclosure of some grand jury materials related to the investigation of\nPresident Clinton’s business dealings and his relationship with a White House intern), with In re\nShepard, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 37, 39-4o (D.D.C. 2oll) (denying as overbroad request for disclosure\nof all testimony and materials associated with every witness before three Watergate grand juries),\nand In re Nichter, 949 F. Supp. 2d 2o5, 2l2-l3 (D.D.C. 2ol3) (denying disclosure of certain\ngrand jury records about Watergate because at least one subject of the testimony was still alive).\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l6 of 3l\n\nThe Government’s invocation of special circumstances, houever, fails at the threshold.\nIts entire premise—that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new\ninformation about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the Government’s investigation into\nthem—is demonstrably false.\n\nThe Court, after receiving the Government’s motion to unseal, ordered it to provide\nmaterials to substantiate its claim that the Maxwell grand jury materials contained undisclosed\ninformation of significant <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or public interest. Specifically, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to submit the grand jury transcripts and exhibits for in camera review, with the\nportions the Government proposed to redact highlighted. And it ordered the Government to file\na submission identifying the portions of the transcripts and exhibits, if any, that are not today\nmaters of public record, including based on Maxwell’s month-long jury trial on the charges\nreturned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government’s submissions in response to the Court’s orders were telling. They\nbelied the Government’s claim, in its motion to unseal, that the Maxwell grand jury materials\ncontain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the\ninvestigation into them. Two features of these materials, which were not disclosed in the\nGovernment’s motion, are noteworthy. The Court reports these here, at a level of generality that\ndoes not disclose the substance of grand jury proceedings.\n\nFirst, the grand juries in this case were not used for investigative purposes. They did not\nhear testimony from any firsthand witness to any event at issue. They did not hear testimony\nfrom any victim, eyewitness, suspect, or even a records custodian. The grand juries met instead\nfor the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2l of 3l\nredactions. /d. at 492-93. And once Biaggi’s testimony had been released, the Circuit\nelaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi\nhad misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand\njury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer l7 questions. /d. at 494. In these “special\ncircumstances,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi’s false account. /d.\n\nThis Court gave careful consideration to unsealing the Maxwell grand jury materials on a\nsimilar rationale. But with the Government having nou conceded that the information it\nproposes to release is redundant of the public record—that this information was “made publicly\navailable at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly reported”—the public interest in\ntesting the Government’s bona fides does not require the extraordinary step of unsealing grand\njury records. Dkt. 8oo at 3. Without any need to review the grand jury materials, the public can\nevaluate for itself the Government’s asserted bases for making this motion.\n\nThe Court therefore denies the Government’s motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary\nto the Government’s depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a mater of significant\n<span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or public interest. Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two\nlaw enforcement agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a mater of\nlongstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the\n2o2l Maxwell trial.\n\nB. Application of the In re Craig Factors\n\nIn cases involving grand jury testimony of significant <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or public interest, /n re\nCraig supplies a framework for evaluating whether disclosure, on balance, is warranted. It\nidentifies non-exclusive factors that may weigh against disclosure, including the interests of the\ndefendant and witnesses. Because the secondhand testimony at issue here is redundant of the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 22 of 3l\npublic-record trial testimony of firsthand witnesses, and thus is not of significant <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or\npublic interest, there is arguably no charter for even undertaking the Jn re Craig inquiry. After\nall, the “special circumstances” exception to Rule 6(e) only applies in “exceptional\ncircumstances,” not to “garden variety” grand jury testimony. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3\n(citation omited); see also Gov’t Mem. at 3-4 (“acknouledg[ing] the extraordinary nature of\n[its] request”).\n\nNonetheless, for completeness, the Court evaluates the Government’s motion in light of\nthe non-exhaustive factors listed in Jn re Craig. The Court also addresses two other factors\nimplicated by the motion: the perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, as expressed in\nleters to the Court; and the systemic interest in grand jury secrecy.\n\nAs this assessment shous, the Government has failed, by a wide margin, to carry its\nburden. These factors, considered together, favor denial of its motion to unseal.\n\nl. Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThis factor ordinarily carries “great weight,” and “the government’s position should be\npaid considerable heed.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But the Government’s position is “not\ndispositive.” Jd. “(Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can government\nopposition preclude it.” /d. And courts in this District, applying the Jn re Craig factors, have\nruled against the Government’s position. See In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d\nat 628-29 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony of two witnesses\nbefore grand jury that indicted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage); Jn re AHA, 49 F.\nSupp. 2d at 278, 297-98 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony before\ngrand juries that investigated and/or indicted Alger Hiss for espionage).\n\nThis factor favors disclosure. But for two reasons, the Court accords this factor limited\nweight.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 24 of 3l\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceedings or the\nGovernment Opposes Disclosure\n\nMaxwell opposes disclosure because, among other reasons, her case remains on direct\nappeal. Dkt. 8o3 at 2 (“Because this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.”’)\n\nThis factor thus weighs against unsealing. The Court, houever, assigns limited weight to\nthis factor because Maxwell, who does not have a legal right to access the grand jury materials,\nhas not seen it. Her opposition is therefore fairly viewed as precautionary. Had Maxwell been\naware that the grand jury materials are duplicative of information in the public record, her\nposition might have been different.\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThis factor addresses the present-day significance of the grand jury materials at issue and\nwhether their disclosure would advance the public interest. This factor so decisively weighs\nagainst unsealing that it alone would require denying the Government’s motion.\n\nArguments to disclose grand jury testimony on account of <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or public interest are\n“totally appropriate” and sometimes may even be weighty. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But for\nthe reasons reviewed above, the grand jury materials here are neither of <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> nor public-\ninterest importance. This evidence was put before the grand juries in June 2o2o and March\n2o2l, in a case that remains on direct appeal. Cf In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp.\n3d at 628-29 (l95o grand jury testimony regarding Julius and Ethel Rosenberg); Jn re AHA, 49\nF. Supp. at 278, 297-98 (l947-l95o grand jury testimony regarding Alger Hiss). And it is not\nof present-day public importance because it consists of summary testimony by law enforcement\nagents recounting information that today is a mater of public record, on account of the month-\nlong trial on the charges returned by the grand jury. Cf In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 494 (grand jury\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 26 of 3l\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe Second Circuit has instructed:\n\nThe timing of the request remains one of the most crucial elements. Time maters\n\nin several ways. First, if <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> interest in a specific case has persisted over a\n\nnumber of years, that serves as an important indication that the public’s interest in\n\nrelease of the information is substantial. (Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops\n\nNorthwest, 44l U.S. 22l, 222 (l979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy\n\nare reduced after the grand jury has ended its activities). Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was convicted spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her conviction remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These circumstances starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 626\n(l95o testimony); Jn re AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (l947-l95o testimony); see also note l2,\nsupra (citing similar D.D.C. cases). But see In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492-93 (testimony less\nthan two years earlier).\n\n'’ The Circuit, in illustrating earlier in its opinion why <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> or public interest considerations\ncould justify the release of grand jury information, stated: “To the extent that the John Wilkes\nBooth or Aaron Burr conspiracies, for example, led to grand jury investigations, <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span>\ninterest might by nou overwhelm any continued need for secrecy.” /d. at lo5.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 3o of 3l\n\nThat admonition requires courts applying the Second Circuit’s “special circumstances”\nexception to grand jury secrecy to invoke it only in rare, “exceptional circumstances,” mindful of\nthe precedent that unsealing would set. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3. The exception, after all,\nderives from a district court’s supervisory authority over grand juries, id. at lo2 & n.2, which\ncarries with it the duty to safeguard “the traditional functioning of the institution,” United States\nv. Williams, 5o4 U.S. 36, 5l (l992). Applying the exception casually or promiscuously, as the\nGovernment’s motion to unseal the summary-witness grand jury testimony here invites, would\nrisk “unravel[ing] the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised,” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo3, and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before “future grand\njuries,” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 222, that the general rule of secrecy still holds.\n\nThis factor weighs heavily against unsealing. Granting the Government’s motion would\nbloat the “special circumstances” doctrine, which to date has warranted disclosure in only a tiny\nnumber of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious\npublic or <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> moment. And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials,\nbecause they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous. The same\ncould be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in\nsupport of charges that later proceeded to trial.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015235.jpg": "Nourkova, V.V., Bernstein D.M., & Loftus, E.F.

United States\nv. Horton, 653 F. App’x 46, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol6). This Court reviews the\ndistrict court’s purely factual findings for clear error. Jd. Houever, the\ndistrict court’s ultimate finding “may be subject to plenary review if it\nrests on a predicate finding which reflects a misperception of a legal\nrule applicable to the particular factor involved.” Jd. at 3l9-2o (quoting\nUnited States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l97 (2d Cir. l987)). That is,\n“even if the court’s finding of a <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> fact relevant to that factor is\nnot clearly erroneous, [the appellate court] may reverse if the court\nevinces a misunderstanding of the legal significance of that <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span>\nfact and if that misunderstanding infects the court's ultimate finding.”\nShakur, 8l7 F.2d at l97.\nMEMORANDUM OF LAW\nI.

Ms. Maxwell had no knouledge of fF\n\nBut the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package\nwith multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of\ntheir assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell’s wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The\nproposed bail package does exactly that.°\n\nc The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and\n\nTherefore a Flight Risk Is Specious\n\nThe government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an\n\nexpertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.\n° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the\nmajority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (/d. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with,\nall of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her a will be\nleft with nothing. Furthermore, the government’s assertion that they could not verify the spouse’s financial\ninformation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (/d. at 24 n.9).

Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “<span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021538.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 36) 3536o39, Pagelo8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l4 of 2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021539.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 363 3536o39, Pagelo9 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l5 of 2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span>,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n292 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “<span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> knouledge” of the case.\n293 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024165.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nMedication Summary\n<span class=\"highlight\">Historical</span>\n\nComplex: NYM--NEW YORK MCC Begin Date: o7/o6/2ol9 End Date: o5/ll/2o2o\nInmate: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54 Quarter: 2777-272?\nMedications listed reflect prescribed medications from the begin date to end date on this report.\nAllergies: Denied\nActive Prescriptions\n\nBisacodyl E.C. 5 MG TAB\n\nTake one tablet (5 MG) by mouth at bedtime AS NEEDED for lo days\n\nRx#: l2l757-NYM Doctor: iG MLP\n\nStart: o7/o9/l9 Exp: o7/l9/l9 D/C: o7/l2/l9 Pharmacy Dispensings: lo TAB in 3o7 days\n\nDocusate Sodium loo MG Cap\n\nTake one capsule (loo MG) by mouth twice daily for 3o days\n\nRx#: l2l823-NYM Doctor: FE OVOR) uo\n\nStart: o7/l2/l9 Exp: o8/ll/l9 D/C: o8/lo/l9 Pharmacy Dispensings: 6o CAP in 3o4 days\n\nDocusate Sodium loo MG Cap\n\nTake one capsule (loo MG) twice daily by mouth with plenty of water\n\nRx#: l22o84-NYM Doctor: FEV OR MD\n\nStart: o7/26/l9 Exp: ol/22/2o D/C: o8/lo/l9 Pharmacy Dispensings: 3o CAP in 29o days\n\nMilk of Magnesia Susp (OTC) (473ML) 4ooMG/5ML\n\nshake well take 2 tablespoonful twice daily by mouth\n\nRx#: l2l835-NYM Doctor: Beaudouin, Robert MD\n\nStart: o7/l2/l9 Exp: o7/l4/l9 Pharmacy Dispensings: 473 ML in 3o4 days\n\nMilk of Magnesia Susp (OTC) (473ML) 4ooMG/5ML\n\nshake well take loml by mouth twice daily AS NEEDED\n\nRx#: l22l5o-NYM Doctor: (GM OR MD\n\nStart: o7/3o/l9 Exp: lo/28/l9 D/C: o8/lo/l9 Pharmacy Dispensings: 473 ML in 286 days\n\nmethyIPREDNISolone 4 MG Tab [ 2l count Pack]\n\nTake the tablet by mouth as directed\n\nRx#: l2l836-NYM Doctor: POOVOR Ro\n\nStart: o7/l2/l9 Exp: o7/l8/l9 Pharmacy Dispensings: 2l tab in 3o4 days\n\nmethyIPREDNISolone 4 MG Tab [ 2l count Pack]\n\nTake the tablet by mouth as directed\n\nRx#: l22l49-NYM Doctor: B39 OR oo\n\nStart: o7/3o/l9 Exp: o8/o5/l9 Pharmacy Dispensings: 2l tab in 286 days\nGenerated o5/ll/2o2o o9:57 vfBYG) HMC)Joac Bureau of Prisons - DAN Page l of 2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024423.jpg": "Please let me knou if you have any questions.\n(oNTNC)\n>>> Hugh Hurwitz PEO bop.gov> 8/23/2ol9 lo:39 AM >>>\nCan | get any <span class=\"highlight\">historical</span> info you have?
