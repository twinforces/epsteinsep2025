The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation.

In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable <span class=\"highlight\">hypothesis</span>.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d.

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006303.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6of:\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “...

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable <span class=\"highlight\">hypothesis</span>.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d.

And we knou that the grooming behaviors that\n\n6 induce that relationship of trust and atachment have a\n\n7 Significant negative affect on an individual's psyche and can\n\n8 strongly and negatively impact their functioning afterwards.\n\n9 So those are things I'm looking for.\n\nlo Q. Dr. Rocchio, to be clear, in your forensic work, do you\n\nll assume that everything a victim reports is true?\n\nl2 A. Absolutely not.\n\nl3 Q. Can you explain that?\n\nl4 A. My role ina forensic capacity is to provide an objective\nl5 answer based upon my evaluation and my review of the\n\nl6 literature. And it is not dependent on who is hiring me, for\nl7 example. So as I mentioned, the reason that I look at all of\nl8 these other documents and the reason I administer psychological\nl9 tests and talk to third parties is precisely because I'm\n2o looking for consistencies and inconsistencies in what the\n2l individual is telling me in order to form an opinion. As part\n22 of my duty in that role is to investigate various hypotheses,\n23 in a forensic seting, it has to be that I'm not being told the\n24 truth.\n25 Q.

Of course, yes.\n\n2 Q. For many reasons. Correct?\n\na A. Sure.\n\n4 Q. And that could be outright lying, could be a reason?\n\n5 A. Gould be.\n\n6 QO. False memories could be a reason, correct?\n\n7 A. Gould be.\n\n8 QO. Intoxication could be a reason?\n\n9 A. Again, these are reasons that have been hypothesized to\n\nlo explain possibilities for false allegations, yes.\n\nll Q. And they are accepted in the literature, correct?\n\nl2 A. That lying exists, or that intoxication can lead to, to\n\nl3 distorted claims? Sure.\n\nl4 Q. Yes. Or a variety of psychiatric disorders, correct?\n\nl5 A. Again, I'm not aware of the scientific research that has\nl6 studied specifically these as predictors of false allegations.\nl7 There's a very large body of scientific literature documenting\nl8 of course that false allegations can occur, but they are --\n\nl9 represent a very small minority of allegations that are made.\n2o And I believe the article that you're reviewing, the authors\n2l are puting forth some hypotheses as to hou or why that might\n22 occur. But I don't believe it's coming from a scientific\nao study, and I'm not aware of one at this point.\n24 Q. OK.

Nou, you spoke about post-event suggestion. Stepping back\n4 for a moment and just using the term post-event information,\n\n5 please tell the jury what that would be and what could\n\n6 constitute such information.\n\n7 A.

Post-event information can be\n\nlo supplied when somebody is being interrogated, particularly, if\nll they're being interrogated with somebody who's got an agenda or\nl2 a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothesis</span> about what might have happened and communicates\n\nl3 that to the person they're interviewing, even inadvertently.\n\nl4 The media is a source of post-event suggestion that\n\nl5 we've actually studied where people are sometimes interviewed\nl6 on the media or media personalities will supply some suggestive\nl7 information that can contaminate memory.\n\nl8 Those are just examples of out there in the real\n\nl9 world, what are the opportunities for post-event suggestion to\n2o become available to a person and potentially contaminate a\n2l memory.\n22 Q. Have you conducted any studies or given any workshops with\n23 regards to interviewing techniques and the effect on memory?\n24 A.
