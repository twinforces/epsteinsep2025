Such an interpretation, rather than an <span class=\"highlight\">insertion</span>\ninto the co-conspirator immunity provision of arbitrary limitations designed to satisfy the\ngovernment’s interests here, is the “common-sense way to read the NPA” that the Court should\nadopt. See Opp. l6.\n\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Conduct Discovery and an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, Counts One through Four have been brought in breach\nof the NPA and should be dismissed. The text of the NPA, read as a whole, unambiguously bars\nMs. Maxwell’s prosecution here, and the government is reduced to arguing that the parties must\nhave meant to write various provisions of the NPA differently than they actually did. These\narguments are manifestly inadequate, and they should be rejected.\n\nShould the Court have any doubt about the parties’ intent, houever, discovery and an\nevidentiary hearing regarding the parties’ intent are warranted. The government’s arguments\nregarding the parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the presentation of evidence. For\nexample, to the extent that the scope of offenses for which the NPA immunized Epstein is\ndeemed relevant to the co-conspirator immunity provision, that scope cannot be delineated\nwithout determining precisely which offenses might have arisen out of the investigation by the\nFBI and the USAO-SDFL (including the investigation into “Epstein’s background”), as well as\nwhich offenses arose out of the undefined “Federal Grand Jury investigation.” Similarly, the\ngovernment’s claims that the parties did not intend to confer the benefit of immunity on Ms.\nMaxwell, and that the parties intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the\nSDFL, raise issues regarding the scope of the SDFL investigation, the USAO-SDFL’s awareness\nof Ms. Maxwell, and the extent to which the investigation involved this District. These issues\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 49l Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\n(“During the meeting, the defendant produced a small bound book and several sheets of legal pad\npaper containing hand-writen notes.”). Again, the book is sewn and bound, like the other copies\nseen by Employee-l, and is not amenable to easy <span class=\"highlight\">insertion</span> of pages. These “alterations” do not\nundermine the authenticity of the book in the slightest, but at most, they go to weight and not\nadmissibility. See Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38; cf Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (“Based on the[]\ntestimony [that electronic communications were accurate], a reasonable juror could have found\nthat the exhibits did represent those conversations, notwithstanding that the e-mails and online\nchats were editable.”).\n\nThe defense is correct that Employee-l cannot say that she saw the specific address book\nthat is Government Exhibit 52 while she worked for Epstein. But she can recognize Government\nExhibit 52 as one of the many copies of the defendant’s address book that she did see, and she can\ntestify to the practice that, close in time to when Government Exhibit 52 left Epstein’s house, the\naddress book was regularly kept in specific places around Epstein’s house. That testimony is\nenough to satisfy the lou bar for authentication, and it is supported by Government Exhibit 6o6\nand by testimony that corroborates private information inside the address book.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 77 of 228 753\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl expert testimony through your cross-examination.\n\n2 MR.
