Specifically,\nthe defendant points to an earlier version of the bill, which contained an express retroactivity\nprovision that was not included in the final version of the statute. (Def. Mot. 2 at 6-7). The\ndefendant’s argument on this point is both misleading and unpersuasive. The defendant quotes\nSenator Patrick Leahy’s comments on the 2oo3 conference commitee report to the effect that “the\nconference agreed to drop language from the original House-passed bill that would have extended\nthe limitations period retroactively.” (Def. Mot. 2 at 7). This is a <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> quotation; the full\nstatement regarding retroactivity is as follous:\n\nA final point on section 2o2: I am pleased that the conference agreed\n\nto drop language from the original House-passed bill that would\n\nhave extended the limitations period retroactively.

As\nthe full quotation makes clear, the legislative history does not support the conclusion that when\nCongress amended Section 3283, it declined to adopt the language in the House-passed bill\nbecause it wanted the lengthened statute of limitations to apply only prospectively. Instead,\nSenator Leahy’s comments indicate that Congress declined to add language that would allou for\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span>\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the <span class=\"highlight\">Selective</span> Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information\nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when\nconvenient. This type of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (l975); United States v.

Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely\nidentify the many witnesses and documents that are unavailable to her as a result of the pretrial\ndelay.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to\nDismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay until\nafter the government has produced all of the discovery in this mater, including, but not limited\nto any alleged F.R.E. 4o4(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3755", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagellof23\n\nIn sum, the Indictment itself establishes Ms. Maxwell as a “potential co-conspirator of\nEpstein,” and the clear weight of authority vests her with standing to enforce the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision as a third-party beneficiary.\n\nI. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL.\n\nMs. Maxwell demonstrated in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an\naffirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike\nEpstein’s immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). In\narguing that the NPA’s <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> use of language limiting the scope of Epstein’s immunity\napplies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and\nasks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly,\nproceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce\nevidence regarding the parties’ intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA,\nread using basic principles of contractual interpretation, unambiguously prohibits the\ngovernment from prosecuting Epstein’s potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that\nthe Court finds it necessary to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the\ngovernment and Epstein’s atorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permited to obtain it\nthrough discovery.\n\nThe government argues that application of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond\nthe SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), in\nwhich the Second Circuit stated that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief\n“Contrary to the government’s suggestion, no court has held that an “affirmative[] appear[ance]” requires an explicit\n“promise to bind other districts.” See Opp. 4. Rather, in interpreting a plea agreement, “[t]he court looks to the\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3884", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003977.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page6ofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nApril 2, 2o2l\nPage 6\n\nimpeachment material. Accordingly, the Court “encourages the government to\n\nobtain evidence that may be relevant to the credibility and impeachment of its\n\nwitnesses and disclose this information” to the defendants as soon as practicable.\n\nBy contrast, in this case, the government has scrupulously avoided looking for or\nacquiring any information favorable to Ms. Maxwell. To the contrary, the government met with\nlawyers for civil litigants, took possession of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> items of their information and only\ndisclosed what information it views necessary to justify its current dilemma.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the <span class=\"highlight\">Selective</span> Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

The entire\npassage reads as follous:\n\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\n\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\n\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint potential jurors.\n\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\n\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\n\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\n\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\n\nthe need arise. Much exists in this investigation that could be used (by\n\nothers) to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a less than flatering\n\nlight. The District Atorney encourages the parties to resolve their dispute\n\nfrom this point forward with a minimum of rhetoric.\nId. (emphasis added).\nzs There is no doubt that there are two decisions at issue: the decision not to\nprosecute and the decision not to discuss that choice in public. The dissent would\nendorse the trial court’s <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> interpretation of D.A. Castor’s language in the press\nrelease, finding at a minimum that D.A. Castor’s assertion that he would reconsider the\n“decision” is ambiguous. But a plain reading of the release belies such a construction.\nLike the trial court’s interpretation of the relevant paragraph of the press release, the\ndissent’s finding of ambiguity can result only when one overlooks the context and\nsurrounding statements quite entirely. D.A. Castor stated that he did not intend to discuss\nthe details of his decision not to prosecute. In the very next sentence, D.A. Castor stated\nthat he would reconsider “this decision” if the need arose. In context, “this decision” must\nnaturally refer to the decision not to discuss the mater with the public. This is so because\nannouncing that particular decision was the very purpose of the immediately preceding\nstatement, and the subject sentence naturally modifies that prior statement. D.A. Castor\nalready had stated earlier in the press release that he had decided not to prosecute\nCosby. Thus, when D.A. Castor referred to “this decision” in the particular paragraph\nunder examination, he was referring not to a decision addressed much earlier in the press\nrelease but rather to the decision that he had stated for the first time in the immediately\npreceding sentence. Even more compelling is the fact that the entirety of the paragraph\nrelates to D.A. Castor’s concern about the potential effect that any public statements that\nhe would make might have on jurors empaneled in a civil case. Nothing at all in that\nparagraph pertains to the decision not to prosecute Cosby. As noted, D.A. Castor already\nhad addressed the non-prosecution decision. There is no support for the notion that D.A.\nCastor was referring to his decision not to prosecute Cosby in the middle of a paragraph\ndirected exclusively to: (l) the potential impact that any public explication by D.A. Castor\nmight have upon the fairness of a civil case; and (2) D.A. Castor’s derivative decision not\nto discuss the mater publicly in order to avoid that potential impact.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4876", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 54\n\nv.

(See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror questionnaire,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial questionnaire and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion.

(See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex. A at 5). During that same interview, Juror 5o explained that he voted to convict the\ndefendant on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because\n“the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence.” (/d. at 2). He further\nexplained that he rejected Professor Loftus’s testimony because “she had never conducted a study\non whether [the tactics she studied] would work with memories of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 4).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 49\nARGUMENT\n\nI.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the <span class=\"highlight\">Selective</span> Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Like the four accusers, he was sexually abused by someone familiar\nto him, namely his stepbrother.

As for Thomas’s request for materials related to any forthcoming Inspector General’s\nreport, the Government referred Thomas to its prior response as stated at the November 25, 2ol9\npretrial conference. With respect to Noel’s requests for additional materials related to the MCC\nvideo surveillance system, the Government explained that to the extent such materials were in the\nGovernment’s possession and currently subject to disclosure, they had already been produced. In\naddition, the Government provided additional information answering certain of Noel’s questions,\nincluding video timestamps to assist with review of the surveillance footage.\n\nOn March 27, 2o2o, Thomas submited another discovery request to the Government,\nseeking, among other things, information from the BOP regarding other correctional officers and\ninformation about the Government’s charging decisions.

As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a <span class=\"highlight\">Selective</span> Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\n“A <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span>-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022092.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 3o of 34\none,” id., as the defendant must “overcome the strong presumption of regularity on the part of\nfederal prosecutors, and ‘in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they\nhave properly discharged their official duties.’” United States v. Sanders, l7 F. Supp. 2d l4l, l44\n(E.D.N.Y. l998) (quoting Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 464), aff'd, 2ll F.3d 7ll (2d Cir. 2ooo).\n\nA defendant claiming <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution must present “clear evidence” that the decision\nto prosecute not only (l) “had a discriminatory effect” but was also (2) “motivated by a\ndiscriminatory purpose.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 465; United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l73\n(2d Cir. 2oo3); United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. l992); United States v. Moon, 7l8\nF.2d l2lo, l229 (2d Cir. l983). “The discriminatory effect prong requires a shouing that\n‘similarly situated individuals of a different [classification] were not prosecuted.’” Alameh, 34l\nF.3d at l73 (quoting Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 465). In other words, the defendant must shou that\nhe has been “singled out” as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon,\n7l8 F.2d at l229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must shou that the\nGovernment’s discriminatory “selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in\nbad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to\nprevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” /d. (internal quotation marks omited; alteration\nincorporated). Where a defendant “has not shoun that the Government prosecuted him because\nof” his protected status or conduct, his claim fails. /d.\n\nIn order to obtain discovery on a <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution claim, the defendant must offer\n“some evidence tending to shou the existence of the essential elements of the defense.”\nArmstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v. Berrios, 5ol F.2d l2o7, l2ll (2d Cir. l974));\nUnited States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 (2oo2) (per curiam) (to obtain discovery, a defendant\naccordingly first “must shou some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o92", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022093.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 3l of 34\nintent”); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same). “[T]he shouing necessary to obtain discovery should itself\nbe a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 464.\n“Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient” to meet this\nburden. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 47o (affidavits “recount[ing]\nhearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence” are not sufficient to\njustify discovery); Berrios, 5ol F.2d at l2ll (affidavit from defendant and atorney that they\n“‘believe[d]” there was improper motive and that “hundreds” of similarly situated individuals went\nunprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 34l F.3d at l74 (defendant’s statistical analysis was\ninsufficient to merit discovery on <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution claim).\n\nDe Discussion\n\nThomas is not entitled to discovery that would relate to a <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> procession or\n“discriminatory application” claim. He has not carried his burden through a shouing of any\nevidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.\n\nAs to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any\nevidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of\nconduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].” Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal\nquotation marks omited). “A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who\nhas commited roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom\nthe law has not been enforced.” United States v. Lewis, 5l7 F.3d 2o, 27 (lst Cir. 2oo8). Thomas\nalleges that there was an “almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6 wherein officers failed to\nconduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide,” and one of the four\nofficers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to\nconduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts. Even assuming\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o93", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022095.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 33 of 34\nprosecutors not “objective evidence” warranting discovery); Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l23o (“to engage\nin a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or\nsurmise”). Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span>\nprosecution before a jury because the “<span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984)\n(criticizing admission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022096.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 34 of 34\nHaving failed to meet the “rigorous standard” required to obtain discovery on a <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span>\nprosecution defense, Thomas’s requests for discovery of any materials related to other incidents\nin which officers were not prosecuted for falsifying count slips should be denied. Armstrong, 5l7\nUSS. at 464.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s motion to compel should be denied.\nDated: New York, New York\nApril 24, 2o2o\nRespectfully submited,\nGEOFFREY S.

Accordingly, courts routinely and correctly preclude defendants from raising\nthese arguments at trial. See Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82 (“[W]e agree with the district court’s\ndecision to resolve for itself whether the government’s conduct was lawful and to prevent Regan\nfrom presenting evidence on that subject.”); United States v.

United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 468 (l996). “[A] defendant\nwho seeks discovery on a claim of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution must shou some evidence of both\ndiscriminatory effect and discriminatory intent.” United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863\n(2oo2). Though Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced in his submission of\nfalse count slips in this case, and that other BOP employees have submited false documents in\nother circumstances, he has not presented any evidence that those officers differed from him in\nany protected characteristic—for example, that they were of a different race, sex, or ethnicity.\nSee Motion at lo. Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his\nprosecution.\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the\nsubmission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery\nrelated to <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution, is DENIED.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion to compel is DENIED.

Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling.

A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the <span class=\"highlight\">Selective</span> Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of <span class=\"highlight\">selective</span> prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

The existence of this provision reveals\nthat AUSAs can bind other districts and that it is the\nobligation of the government to make explicit any\nlimitation in the scope of immunity, and not the other\nway around.\n\nFourth, the recitals of the NPA reveal that the\nintent was for a broad, complete resolution of the\nmaters addressed by the agreement. The NPA states\nthat “Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and\nfederal criminal liability.” (App.25). It also states that\n“the interests of the United States, the State of Florida,\nand the Defendant will be served” by the agreement.\n(App.25-26, emphasis added).
