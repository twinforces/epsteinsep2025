David Perry QC\n\nl.l. David Perry QC is a barrister and former head of chambers at 6K BW College Hill. From\nl99l to l997, he was one of the Standing Counsel to the Department of Trade and\nIndustry. From l997 to 2ool, he was Junior Treasury Counsel to the Croun at the Central\nCriminal Court and Senior Treasury Counsel from 2ool until 2oo6, when he ‘took silk’\n(i.e. was appointed Queen’s Counsel). He is a deputy High Court Judge and a judge of\nthe Court of Appeal of Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nl.2. Mr Perry prosecutes and defends and has extensive experience of extradition and mutual\nlegal assistance cases, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. He is a member of the\nEditorial Board of the Criminal Law Review and a joint editor of Blackstone’s Criminal\nPractice, a leading practitioners’ work.\n\n2. Extradition — Experience and Expertise\n\n2.l. Mr Perry is widely considered one of the UK’s pre-eminent extradition practitioners and\nis listed as such in the leading industry journals. He has acted on behalf of many overseas\ngovernments and appeared in the High Court, House of Lords and Supreme Court in the\nleading cases. He has acted as an expert consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on\ninternational co-operation and has advised overseas governments on the drafting and\nimplementation of their domestic legislation.\n\n3. Independent review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements\n\n3.l. In 2oll/l2, together with Lord Justice Scot Baker and Anand Doobay, Mr Perry was\nappointed by the UK Government to conduct the Home Office’s Independent Review of\nthe UK’s extradition arrangements. The review formed the basis of changes to the\nExtradition Act 2oo3.\n\n3.2. The year-long review looked in detail at the follouing five areas:\n® the Home Secretary’s discretionary pouers to stop extradition.\n\ne the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, which deals with extradition\nrequests between European countries.\n\ne where a crime is mainly commited in the UK, whether the person should be tried\nin the UK.\n\ne whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced.\n\ne whether requesting countries should be required to provide sufficient evidence to\nprove an allegation.\n\n3.3. The report, totalling 488 pages and presented to the Home Secretary on 3o September\n2oll, made a series of recommendations in respect of the UK’s extradition arrangements.\nPart 7 of the report looked specifically at extradition arrangements between the United\nStates and United Kingdom under the 2oo3 UK-US Treaty on Extradition. It assessed the\n<span class=\"highlight\">effectiveness</span> of the tests used in each jurisdiction and laid out the authors’ observations\non the procedures under the treaty. Their conclusion was that the 2oo3 treaty was\noperating fairly and there was no basis to seek its renegotiation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ll4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l59 Filed o2/l6/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

But operating in a dual\ncapacity, lawyer and witness, would create confusion, subject Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers to cross-\nexamination, and potentially constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, courts in this\nCircuit do not allou atorneys to function in this dual role, even if the defendant is willing. See\nUnited States v.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial <span class=\"highlight\">effectiveness</span> at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo).

We knou from our experiences that the <span class=\"highlight\">effectiveness</span>\nof the voir dire process in eliciting truthful answers to questions designed to weed out biased or\notherwise unqualified jurors is a fundamental structural prerequisite for ensuring our clients,\noften the most vulnerable and scorned members of society, receive a fair trial.

With the experience of its members as a guide, NACDL believes it can provide the\nCourt with additional perspective concerning the issues that have been raised in the Defendant’s\npost-verdict motion. We are seriously concerned that where a juror gives a false answer to a\nquestion that is crucially important in assessing that juror’s ability to be a fair and impartial juror,\nthe structural integrity of the trial has been lost regardless of whether the false answer was given\ndeliberately. We believe, as we will discuss, that such a conclusion is consistent with existing\ncase law.\n\n6.
