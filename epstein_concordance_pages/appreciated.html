Ghislaine\nwas no exception in deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these values. For example, | think it\nis no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),\nsubmersible pilot and more, as they all require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and\nreactions and no small amount of courage. These are not the usual pursuits of a\n“flipbberti-gibbet” or a “socialite”, terms with which my sister has been branded with to this day.\nGhislaine was always an extremely generous, thoughtful and kind host in New York to her many\nsiblings including me, and her many nieces and nephews which | deeply <span class=\"highlight\">appreciated</span>. She also\nhelped our mother greatly in her late life and exhibited deep caring and concern which | noticed\npersonally on many occasions. For example she dropped everything and flew to France at her\noun expense to help me with medical issues our mother was having and to just be there to\ncomfort her. She also did not hesitate to help her many personal friends with their problems not\nonly with kindness but practical help too and did not ask for anything in return.\n\nMy sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple companies and\norganizations which created products and services, as well as employment. An important\nexample is that in 2ol2, Ghislaine turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit,\nThe TerraMar Project, with the mission to create a \"global ocean community\" based on the\nidea of shared ounership and responsibility of the global “commons”—the high seas or\ninternational waters. Efforts like these to help our planet are sorely needed and frankly, our\nfragile Earth continues to need all the help and activism it can get. It would be within your\npouer to allou her to renew her fight as soon as possible for Ocean conservation In light of\nthe dire warning just issued by the UN that the “Earth’s oceans have reached the hotest\nand most acidic levels on record”.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo498", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l5 of 264 42l\nLClVMAXl\n\nl MS.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\n<span class=\"highlight\">appreciated</span> his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032313.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 28\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nUpon Robson s entry in the unmarked Detective vehicle, I placed a tape\nrecorder within the vehicle to record any conversations within the\nvehicle.
